1
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,083
- I don't know about this,
Poirot.

2
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,916
- Oh, but I can assure you,
Chief Inspector,

3
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,958
it is of the quality
most fine.

4
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,708
- Well, I'm sure, but--
- Yes, sir.

5
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,333
- Have you got a nice bit
of scrag end?

6
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,333
- Scrag end, sir?

7
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,708
- Ah, no, no, no, no.

8
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,708
No, Chief Inspector,
the scrag end,

9
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,499
it is an animal
native to Isleworth, huh?

10
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,124
It does not, I think,
habituate here as well.

11
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,458
No, no, no, no, might I suggest
the muscle de filet mignon,

12
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,374
cooked au poivre
avec la sauce béarnaise?

13
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:28,708
- All right, then.

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,916
- Thank you, sir.

15
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,791
- And the good Madame Japp,
she is away for how long?

16
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,333
- Another week.

17
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,749
Should have been my holiday too,
you know, Poirot.

18
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,541
- So the, um,
how do you call it, then?

19
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,666
The leaving,
it has been canceled.

20
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,499
- All leave canceled, yes.

21
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,249
It's these men from Jarrow.

22
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,041
We've got 200 of 'em
heading for London,

23
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:52,249
and suddenly the government's
reading the Riot Act.

24
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,083
- But even so,
Chief Inspector,

25
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,541
it gives you the chance,
once again,

26
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,083
to enjoy the life
of the single man, n'est-ce pas?

27
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,999
- I'm not sure about enjoy.

28
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,458
- Sir?

29
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,541
That will be six shillings.

30
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,583
- I beg your pardon?

31
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,749
Six shillings
for a piece of meat?

32
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,208
That's three days
of housekeeping, Poirot.

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,958
- Jarrow marchers,
spare some money, sir?

34
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,041
- Hold on a minute, Poirot.

35
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,583
- Can you spare six pence, sir,
for the Jarrow marchers?

36
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,041
- Not anymore, I can't.

37
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,166
- Any change?

38
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:24,874
Jarrow marchers.

39
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,374
Spare some change
for the marchers, sir?

40
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,999
- Ah, you are reading
of Sir Arthur Stanley.

41
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,208
- Yes.

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,624
- He is a champion,
is he not,

43
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:37,166
of the men
marching now to London.

44
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,666
- That's right.

45
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,124
I met him once,

46
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,499
about ten years ago.

47
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,999
- You are an admirer of his?

48
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,583
- I wouldn't say that.

49
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,541
Well, I best be getting back,
Poirot.

50
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,916
I've got the dusting to do.

51
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,333
- Ah, but, Chief Inspector,

52
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,541
now is the time to consider
your dessert.

53
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,083
- That's all right, Poirot.

54
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,416
I think I'll forget
about the dessert.

55
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,291
- American?

56
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,541
- That's right.
Sally Finch.

57
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,874
- On holiday?

58
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,333
- No, I'm studying
English literature.

59
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,958
I've just had a week's vacation
in Amsterdam.

60
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,874
- It is me, Leonard Bateson.

61
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,249
Thank you.

62
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,583
I should have warned you,
Sally.

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,041
They don't like young people,
students, or foreigners.

64
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,458
- Are you two
traveling together?

65
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,708
- Yes.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,874
- Well, let's have a look
inside there.

67
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,749
- 68%, Nigel.

68
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,958
That's the number of jobless
in Jarrow.

69
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,874
- Where is Jarrow?

70
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,999
- Oh!
But that's just the point.

71
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,499
That's why
they're marching here.

72
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:28,583
- Hi.

73
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,874
- Welcome back,
the weary travelers.

74
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,541
- How was Amsterdam, Sally?

75
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,541
- Oh, it was wonderful.

76
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,916
- It was just the journey back.

77
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,291
It was hell.

78
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,541
Do you know they nearly
arrested me for smuggling?

79
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,666
- Smuggling what?

80
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,874
- 100 cigarettes.

81
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:42,958
- Well, maybe that's why

82
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,333
the police are coming here,
then.

83
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,624
- The police?

84
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,208
- They're not coming here,
are they?

85
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,416
- Guilty conscience, Celia?

86
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,583
What do they want?

87
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,833
- I don't know.

88
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,749
Ma Hubbard told me
just now.

89
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,249
They're investigating something.

90
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,333
- Maybe it's something to do
with all these thefts.

91
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,791
It's about time.

92
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,208
- They wouldn't call the police
for that,

93
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,333
would they?

94
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,749
- I don't know.

95
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,333
Anyway, I have to make a call.

96
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,874
I'll see you.

97
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,124
- You seem to have rattled
our American friend, Patricia.

98
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:18,416
Maybe she's the one
with the guilty conscience.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,791
- They're sending a constable
this evening.

100
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,708
It's about some poor man
shot in Soho.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,166
The police think
he was a foreigner,

102
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,541
maybe a student.

103
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,666
- And that's why
they're checking here?

104
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,749
- Yes, they're visiting
all the student hostels,

105
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,999
as if we don't have
problems enough.

106
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,333
- It's still happening, then.

107
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,166
- Why, yes.

108
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,041
I mean, a stethoscope,
cigarette lighter, bracelet,

109
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,166
box of boracic powder--
the list goes on and on.

110
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,541
- You know, I could have a word
with Mr. Poirot.

111
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,416
- Oh, no.

112
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,833
Don't be silly,
Felicity, dear.

113
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,999
No, it's our problem.
We'll deal with it.

114
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,333
- Ah, there you are.

115
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,499
- Good afternoon,
Mrs. Nicoletis.

116
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,166
I don't believe
you've met my sister.

117
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,458
- Your sister, no.

118
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,124
It's you I must speak with,
Mrs. Hubbard.

119
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,291
These bills!

120
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,916
- I was just about to leave.

121
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,208
- Oh, please, Mrs. Nicoletis,
can't this wait?

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,416
- Well, all right,
you can stay.

123
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,291
We can talk tomorrow
or the day after,

124
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,291
but soon, before I ruin.

125
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,249
- That was Mrs. Nicoletis.

126
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,874
She owns the hostel.

127
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,166
- Nicoletis.

128
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,416
That's a Greek name,
isn't it?

129
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,583
- Yes.

130
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,624
- I suppose that explains it.

131
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,583
- Quick, quick!

132
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,374
Give it to me.

133
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,374
I go now.

134
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,083
Ah, good evening, Officer.

135
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,374
Go in, go in.

136
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,541
- Ah, good evening, Officer.

137
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,041
Ah, do come through.

138
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,791
The students
are waiting for you,

139
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:34,208
if you'd care to come
this way.

140
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:55,999
- Mm, these are good,

141
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,916
the best yet.

142
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:07,458
Christina, what's the matter?

143
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,083
- I frightened, Giorgios.

144
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,291
I have enough.

145
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:13,583
- You're afraid?

146
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,916
What, of the police?

147
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,374
- No, not the police.

148
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,083
I losing control.

149
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,083
- No, no, no, no, no.

150
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,958
No c'est imposible.

151
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,166
Miss Lemon.

152
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:54,749
Miss Lemon, there are
three mistakes in this letter.

153
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,999
- Oh, Mr. Poirot.

154
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,999
- Why, it has never happened
before, not once,

155
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:12,041
and now the three errors
of typing on the one page.

156
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,083
- Mr. Poirot,
I don't know what to say.

157
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,833
- You are perhaps unwell?

158
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,916
- No.

159
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,166
Yes.

160
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,708
I suppose in a way I am.

161
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,666
I've been very worried,
Mr. Poirot.

162
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,708
It's my sister, Florence.

163
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,208
- One moment,
if you please, Miss Lemon.

164
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,083
You have a sister?

165
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,999
- Yes.

166
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,541
She lived in Singapore,
but then her husband died,

167
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,999
and now she's the housekeeper
at a hostel,

168
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,708
a student hostel
in Hickory Road.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,541
- And it is this sister of yours
who has a problem?

170
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,624
- Yes.

171
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,583
Things have been disappearing,
odd things,

172
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,874
and in a most unusual way.

173
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,041
She's worried, Mr. Poirot,

174
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:01,374
and I suppose
that's what's worrying me.

175
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,416
- I see.

176
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,874
How would it be, Miss Lemon,

177
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:11,041
if you and I would have tea
with your sister this afternoon?

178
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,916
- Could you, Mr. Poirot?

179
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,583
Would you?

180
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,874
- "Stethoscope,
cigarette lighter,

181
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:24,208
"box of boracic powder,
electric lightbulbs,

182
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,458
evening shoe"--

183
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,374
- Only the one shoe?

184
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,041
- Yes.

185
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,708
- Please do continue,
Madame Hubbard.

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,999
- "Silk scarf, rucksack"--

187
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,583
We found that cut up
in the boiler room,

188
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,208
outside in the backyard.

189
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,166
And one of the girls, Patricia,
lost a diamond ring.

190
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,333
Well, then,
we got that back too.

191
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,999
- And how did you get that back,
madame?

192
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,791
- Well, it was the most
extraordinary thing.

193
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,333
It turned up in the soup.

194
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,749
- It doesn't make
any sense at all,

195
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,291
does it, Mr. Poirot?

196
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,999
- No, it is indeed most unusual,
Miss Lemon.

197
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,083
Merci.

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,541
I must congratulate you,
Madame Hubbard.

199
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,624
- I'm sorry?

200
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,874
- No, I must congratulate you

201
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,291
on having a problem
so unique and beautiful.

202
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,874
- Oh.

203
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,458
- Madame Hubbard, are you able
to describe for me this shoe?

204
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,541
- Oh, certainly.

205
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,583
It was most distinctive.

206
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,958
- Distinctive?

207
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,749
- But what are you going to do
about it, Mr. Poirot?

208
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,958
- Et bien, to begin with,
I must make the acquaintance

209
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,208
of the students who live at
number 26 Hickory Road,

210
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,541
but in a matter that will not,
how you say,

211
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,291
wake up the suspicion.

212
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,208
- Mrs. Hubbard,

213
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,541
who is this man,
Hercule Poirot?

214
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,666
- Mr. Poirot,
Mrs. Nicoletis.

215
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,833
He's a famous
private detective.

216
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,708
- A private detective,

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,208
here, in my hostel?

218
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
- Well, the students
will be very interested.

219
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:04,416
You don't have any objection,
do you?

220
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,958
- No.

221
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,749
Why should I object
to Mr. Poirot?

222
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,999
- You'll be able to come,
won't you, Patricia?

223
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,291
- Oh, yes, I'll be here.

224
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:18,499
- No, no, no.

225
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,916
You don't understand,
Celia.

226
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,416
Look, I could murder someone
if I wanted to,

227
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,749
but only if
there was no motive.

228
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,374
- How can I understand when you
don't explain it to me, Colin?

229
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:34,041
- But I have explained it.

230
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:35,916
- Have you heard about
this great detective

231
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,333
we've got coming to see us?

232
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,416
- Yes, Val,
I saw Ma Hubbard just now.

233
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,791
- It certainly got Colin going,

234
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,249
I'm afraid.

235
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,833
- I'm just saying
murderers get caught

236
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,541
because they have a motive.

237
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,333
Take away the motive,
and they are invisible.

238
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,666
- That's a horrible thought.

239
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,083
- Is there any milk left,
or has that been stolen as well?

240
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,999
- I finished it.

241
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,958
- If you ask me, that's what
we need here, a detective.

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,291
- Oh, come on, Patricia.

243
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,958
- No, I hate it here,

244
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,958
always wondering
what's gonna vanish next.

245
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,083
Maybe this Mr. Poirot
will be able to sort it out.

246
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,041
- Miss Lemon.

247
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:51,999
Merci.

248
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,416
- I'm Celia Austin, Mr. Poirot.

249
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,291
I'm on a part-time course
in chemistry.

250
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,124
- Colin McNabb, psychology.

251
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,374
- I'm Patricia Lane.
I'm studying politics.

252
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,708
- I'm Sally Finch.

253
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,541
I'm here
on a Fulbright scholarship,

254
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,041
studying English lit.

255
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:22,624
- Valerie Hobhouse, studying
fashion and creating it.

256
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:27,124
- Leonard Bateson,
soon to be Dr. Leonard Bateson,

257
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,249
studying medicine.

258
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,541
- And I'm Nigel Chapman,

259
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,999
studying medieval history
and archeology.

260
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,874
Well, if that's
the introductions over,

261
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,249
let's have the soup, Ma.

262
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,249
I'm starving.

263
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,458
- Are you going to talk to us
about crime, Mr. Poirot?

264
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,083
- After the supper, oui.

265
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
That is indeed my intention.

266
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,541
- You know, Colin thinks
he'd make a good detective.

267
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,916
- Or a good criminal.

268
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:53,416
- Well, why not?

269
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:57,166
If you understood the psychology
of a crime the way I do,

270
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,041
then you could disguise it.

271
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,708
And that way,
you would never be caught.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
- What a frightening thought.

273
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,249
- Yes, indeed,
but it is wrong.

274
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,958
- Why?

275
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,249
- Because the little gray cells,
they see everything.

276
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,166
It is the clues,
always the little mistakes

277
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,458
that the criminal ignores,

278
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,041
that opens the door
to the psychology

279
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:23,249
and so to the crime.

280
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,333
- I still think Colin's right.

281
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,624
- You enjoy your dinner,
Mr. Poirot.

282
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,124
We'll have time
for making speeches later.

283
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:38,458
- Retsina, Mr. Poirot.

284
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,666
It come from my hometown.

285
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:53,499
- You see, always the prevention
is better than the cure,

286
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,083
and so we try to prevent
the murders

287
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,291
before they are committed.

288
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:00,666
Thank you.

289
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:08,958
- Now,
has anyone got any questions?

290
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,166
- Yes, I have one.

291
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,749
What I'd like to know is,

292
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:18,208
what's your real motive
in coming here tonight?

293
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,291
- Really, Len.

294
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,416
- Oh, come on, Ma.

295
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,208
You arranged this dinner
at short notice

296
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,791
and with Mr. Poirot,
of all people.

297
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:28,208
You've come to investigate us,
haven't you?

298
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,083
- There hasn't been
a murder here, has there?

299
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:34,166
- No, it's about all the thefts,
isn't it?

300
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,624
That's why he's here.

301
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,916
- Oui.

302
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:43,874
That is indeed why I am here,
mademoiselle.

303
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,249
- Well, I'll be.

304
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,208
- Well, it's either Mr. Poirot
or the police.

305
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,958
We have to do something.

306
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,666
- Yes, but what can you do,
move in and spy on us?

307
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,166
- No, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

308
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:57,791
but I can begin with the return
of something to its owner.

309
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,916
S'il vous plaît, Miss Lemon.

310
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,833
- That's my shoe,

311
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
my lost shoe.

312
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,166
- How the hell
did you do that?

313
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,791
- You haven't got my lighter,
have you?

314
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,124
- And my stethoscope.

315
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,749
- Where did you find it,
Mr. Poirot?

316
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,041
- Oh, Mademoiselle Patricia,
it was you, was it not,

317
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,666
who had lost a diamond ring?

318
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,291
- Yes, but I found it again.

319
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,958
- In my soup.

320
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,416
- And the soup,
it was served then

321
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,374
in exactly the same manner
as it was tonight?

322
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,124
- Yes.
- Ah.

323
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,583
- To hell with the ring.

324
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,749
Tell us about the shoe.

325
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,124
- Miss Lemon.

326
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,583
- Acting
on Mr. Poirot's instructions,

327
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,124
I picked it up this afternoon

328
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:48,083
at the London Transport
Lost Property Office.

329
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,999
- How did you know
to look there?

330
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,749
- A simple process of deduction,
mademoiselle.

331
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,541
One shoe, it cannot be worn,

332
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,666
and it is not possible
to sell.

333
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,291
Alors the simplest way--

334
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,541
- Is to leave it on a bus
or a train.

335
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,833
- Oui, c'est ça.

336
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,958
That was my guess,
and, of course, I was right.

337
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,166
The shoe, it was discovered
on the bus with a number 42.

338
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,916
Now, that bus, I believe,
passes close by.

339
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,249
- That bus goes to the hospital.

340
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,374
- Ah, well,
that narrows the field a bit.

341
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:19,708
I'm studying medicine.

342
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,541
I take that bus every day.

343
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,333
- Come on, Len,
you're not the only one.

344
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,249
- I go on that bus too.

345
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,624
I have an afternoon job
in the pharmacy.

346
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,249
- Any one of us
could have got on that bus.

347
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,541
It doesn't prove anything.

348
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,749
- I am of your opinion,
Monsieur Chapman.

349
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,791
Any one of you
could be the thief.

350
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:39,333
- So what do you advise us
to do?

351
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,624
- There is something here at
Hickory Road that I do not like,

352
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,666
that causes me to fear.

353
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,666
The rucksack
that is cut to pieces--

354
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,208
that is not nice.

355
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,708
You ask my advice?

356
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,458
It is this:
go to the police.

357
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,249
Go now, madame.

358
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:08,124
No time can be lost.

359
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,749
No more diamonds,

360
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,958
not for a long time.

361
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,374
- This man, Poirot--

362
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,124
- He's dangerous.

363
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,458
- It's nothing to do with us.

364
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,999
We can go on as usual.

365
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:37,416
- No, Giorgios.

366
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,916
This is my business.

367
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,624
I make the rules.

368
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:42,499
- Then tell me
who's working for you.

369
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,499
Who are you afraid of?

370
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,499
- No, it's better you not know.

371
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,916
Better for you.

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,124
- Mr. Poirot,

373
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:59,708
Celia Austin and Colin McNabb
are here to see you

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,833
from Hickory Road.

375
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,083
- Please do show them in,
Miss Lemon.

376
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,124
- Mr. Poirot, I had to see you.

377
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,583
After what you said
last night--

378
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,916
- Mademoiselle Celia,
Monsieur McNabb.

379
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,583
Asseyez, s'il vous plaît.

380
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,249
- Mr. Poirot, I'm the thief.

381
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,333
I took those things.

382
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,208
- No, you're not a thief,
Celia.

383
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,624
It's not the right word.

384
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,458
- I feel terrible.

385
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,083
- Look, she couldn't help it.

386
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,499
It's a medical condition.

387
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,291
It's not a case for the police.

388
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,124
- Ah, so you believe,
mademoiselle, that you suffer

389
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,166
from the medical condition
known as the kleptomania?

390
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,708
- Yes, yes.

391
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,249
I never meant to take anything,
but I couldn't help it.

392
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,083
- Celia's going to return
everything.

393
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,124
- I can't return the bracelet
or the cigarette lighter.

394
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,791
I put them down a gutter.

395
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:05,458
But I'll buy new ones.

396
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,499
- And what about the
stethoscope, mademoiselle?

397
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,749
Where did you put that?

398
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,333
- I didn't take the stethoscope.

399
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,291
I'd never take anything
as expensive as that.

400
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:13,749
- But you stole
the diamond ring

401
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:16,416
belonging to Mademoiselle
Patricia Lane, did you not?

402
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:20,333
- Yes, but it was a mistake.

403
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,749
When I realized it was valuable,
I returned it.

404
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:26,833
- Celia told me everything
after you went last night.

405
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,208
I think she's been very brave.

406
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,708
- Mademoiselle,
for which of these thefts

407
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,124
were you not responsible?

408
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,208
Tell me the truth.

409
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,791
- Not Len's rucksack.

410
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:54,124
I didn't take that,
and I didn't cut it up.

411
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:57,708
Not the lightbulbs,
not the boracic powder--

412
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,958
- Come on.

413
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,999
I hope you're satisfied,
Mr. Poirot.

414
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,791
- I'm writing to Mrs. Hubbard
to apologize,

415
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,208
and I'm going to tell
everyone.

416
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,249
- Listen, don't worry.

417
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:12,499
From now on,
I'm going to look after you.

418
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:19,291
- Mademoiselle,
what you have done...

419
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,499
It is good.

420
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,583
- No more talk of the police,
then?

421
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,874
- As far as you are concerned,
mademoiselle,

422
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,499
no.

423
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,749
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

424
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,874
Just talking to you,
I feel better already.

425
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,249
- Mademoiselle,
Monsieur McNabb.

426
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:41,416
Au revoir.

427
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,666
- Come on, Celia.

428
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,333
- You know, Mr. Poirot,

429
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:08,333
I think we've just been watching
a modern love scene.

430
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,458
- Et bien, Miss Lemon.

431
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,208
Nowadays it is
the maladjusted lives

432
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,874
and the complexes that
bring together the young people.

433
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:19,291
- Well, Florence will be glad
it's all over.

434
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,791
- All over, Miss Lemon?

435
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:27,416
No, it is now that I fear
that it may begin.

436
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:39,624
- So you went to see
the great Monsieur Poirot.

437
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,083
- Yes, he was very kind to me.

438
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,083
You've all been kind.

439
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,374
I don't deserve it.

440
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,041
- Oh, come on, Cee.

441
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,874
Colin's explained.

442
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,916
It wasn't your fault,
and you didn't do any real harm.

443
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:54,583
- Oh, what about my rucksack?

444
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:55,833
That wasn't cheap, you know.

445
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,333
- That wasn't me, Len.

446
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,791
And I didn't take
your stethoscope either.

447
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:01,041
I told you--

448
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:04,624
- Then who was it?

449
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,708
- That's not up to me
to tell you.

450
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,624
But I know who it was,
and I've spoken to them,

451
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,041
and they've promised
to come forward.

452
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,333
- Here you are, Celia.

453
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,083
- Thank you.

454
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,624
- Anyone else for coffee?

455
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,124
- No, thanks, Colin.

456
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:25,749
I've got some work to do.

457
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,291
- Where is everyone tonight?

458
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,791
- Hello, Pat.

459
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:11,374
Where are you sneaking in from?

460
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:12,666
- I wasn't sneaking.

461
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,749
I was at the cinema.

462
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,083
- This is the national program
of the BBC.

463
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,541
Here is the news.

464
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,791
The Jarrow marchers
arrived last night in Bedford.

465
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:43,083
They received a warm welcome
from the mayor

466
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,749
on behalf of his town.

467
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,583
And in a special church service,

468
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,416
prayers were said
for their cause.

469
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,833
The marchers are expected
in London in three days' time

470
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,499
for a rally in Hyde Park.

471
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:57,208
They will also present
a petition

472
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,666
with 12,000 signatures.

473
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,166
- Japp here.

474
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,624
- Dead girl
down at Hickory Road, sir.

475
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,208
- Right, I'm on my way.

476
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,124
- The marchers
are merely exercising

477
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,999
their constitutional right
to present a petition.

478
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,249
- What, you here, Poirot?

479
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:23,916
- Ah, yes, Chief Inspector,
I came as soon as I heard.

480
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,166
- Have you been unwell,
Chief Inspector?

481
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:28,583
- What?

482
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,791
No, I'm all right,
thank you very much.

483
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,083
Let's go in.

484
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:39,791
- Who called the police
without consulting me?

485
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:44,374
The police, here in my
respectable hostel, is outrage!

486
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:45,999
- Please, Mrs. Nicoletis--

487
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,791
- I'm afraid this is
a police matter, Mrs. Nicoletis.

488
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,374
- Poirot, you!

489
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,291
It is your fault!

490
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,041
You come here to my hostel.

491
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,499
You frighten my students
with your accusation,

492
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,499
and now see the result!

493
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,791
- Come on, now, Mrs. Nicoletis.

494
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:01,999
Let me take you upstairs.

495
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,124
- No, I not go.

496
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,249
- Now, come along, my dear.

497
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,041
- No.

498
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:10,291
Why did the detective
come here in my hostel?

499
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:15,333
- Now, this paper,
it is of a type used

500
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,916
for the sleeping draft,
is it not?

501
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,124
And yet...

502
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,208
- Morphine?
- Indeed, sir.

503
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:33,166
- So Celia Austin
was a kleptomaniac.

504
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,416
She admits it to you,
and now this.

505
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,666
- Yes.

506
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,208
- Could it have been suicide?

507
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,999
- The sleeping draft
exchanged for the poison,

508
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,749
no letter of regret...

509
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:48,083
No, I think not,
Chief Inspector.

510
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,791
- But who would want
to kill her?

511
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,999
And why?

512
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,333
Poirot.

513
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,833
- See here, Chief Inspector,
there is a fire escape.

514
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,041
It connects also, I see,
with the room next door.

515
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,749
- And who has that?

516
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,083
- It belongs, I think,
to the American girl,

517
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,583
Mademoiselle Sally Finch.

518
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,999
Mademoiselle Celia,
had, as they say,

519
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:18,999
a room with a view.

520
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:24,166
I do not believe
that Mademoiselle Celia Austin

521
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,541
was a kleptomaniac.

522
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:26,791
- Well, what was she, then?

523
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:28,124
- I give it to you
as my opinion

524
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:29,749
that her pilfering
of the petty objects

525
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:30,999
was done with a purpose.

526
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,291
- What purpose?

527
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:33,583
- Well, let us suppose

528
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,833
that Mademoiselle Celia
had the feelings, huh?

529
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,583
The strong feelings
for a man whose passion

530
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,041
was for the psychology,
but that this man ignored her.

531
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,416
- Ah, you're talking about--

532
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,249
What'd you say his name was?
Colin McNabb?

533
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,541
- Oui.

534
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,374
- Well, let's go see
what he has to say.

535
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:55,249
- So you're telling me
that Celia did what she did

536
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,374
just to attract me?

537
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:00,166
She just wasn't bright enough
to think up an idea like that.

538
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,041
- But you yourself
were attracted to her,

539
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,374
were you not, Monsieur Colin?

540
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,499
- She was a fascinating case.

541
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,083
Was it suicide?

542
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,624
- No, Mr. McNabb, it would
seem that she's been poisoned.

543
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:11,958
- Poisoned?

544
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,291
- With morphine.

545
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,333
- Morphine?

546
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,749
That's not possible.

547
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:19,999
- Why not?

548
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:23,708
- I mean,
nobody would want to kill her,

549
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,583
not Celia.

550
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,333
- You speak, then,
of a murder without a motive?

551
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:33,624
- Well, look, I don't know.

552
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,541
- Monsieur Colin,

553
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,083
you were with Mademoiselle Celia
on the evening of her death.

554
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,499
- Yes.

555
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,833
- Did she say anything then
which you might now recall

556
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,874
in view of what has occurred?

557
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,249
- Well, there was one thing.

558
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:51,541
It was to do
with the--the thefts.

559
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:54,333
She said she knew
who had taken Len's rucksack.

560
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,833
- I don't suppose
she gave you a name.

561
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,083
- No.

562
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:02,124
She said she'd spoken
to someone, but--

563
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,749
Come on, for heaven's sake.

564
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:08,666
- Colin, my God, so it's true.

565
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,749
I only just heard.
- Who are you?

566
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:11,999
- Nigel Chapman.
I live here.

567
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,583
- You're a student?
- Yes.

568
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,166
How did it happen?

569
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,791
- They're saying
she was poisoned, Nigel...

570
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:22,041
with morphine.

571
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:24,291
- Poison.

572
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,416
I don't think it's worked out
quite as you expected,

573
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:27,666
has it, Mr. P?

574
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:28,874
- Do you have any idea

575
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,041
who might have wanted to kill
Miss Austin?

576
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:35,208
- No.
You sure it wasn't suicide?

577
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,999
- Monsieur Nigel, who was here
at the hostel last night?

578
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,666
- Oh, we all were, I think.

579
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,083
Except Patricia,
she must have come in late.

580
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,749
- They think someone
got into her room

581
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,791
and put it
in her sleeping draft.

582
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,666
- In her room?

583
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,249
Last night?

584
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,083
- There is something you wish
to tell us, Monsieur Nigel?

585
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,249
- Well, yes.

586
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,208
Look,
I don't want to be a snitch.

587
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,166
- This is a murder
investigation, Mr. Chapman.

588
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:04,083
- Yes.

589
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,041
Well, my roommate,
Len Bateson,

590
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,791
I saw him go into Cee's room.

591
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:11,041
- At what time?

592
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,583
- It was about an hour
after dinner.

593
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,624
I was just having a bath.

594
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,249
Oh, but, look,
Len would never hurt anyone.

595
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,583
I'm sure there's
a perfectly simple explanation.

596
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,791
- I may be wrong, Poirot,
but it seemed to me

597
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:28,583
that the mention of morphine
meant something to those two.

598
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,916
- Chief Inspector,
the morphine,

599
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,124
from where do you think
it had come?

600
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,499
- You tell me.

601
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,958
- Miss Lemon.

602
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,708
- This girl, Celia Austin,
didn't she say she worked

603
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,291
in the pharmacy
at the hospital?

604
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:44,999
- Exactement.

605
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,166
- You're quite right.

606
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:53,124
I don't understand it.

607
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,874
We are missing
a bottle of morphine tartrate.

608
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,374
- When might it have been taken?

609
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:58,999
- It's impossible to say.

610
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:02,166
It's not a drug
we use very often.

611
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,874
It could've been taken anytime
within the last three months,

612
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,416
since our last stock taking.

613
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:10,708
- But entry to the pharmacy,
it is, of course, restricted.

614
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,291
- Absolutely.

615
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:16,291
It was Celia,
two other women dispensers,

616
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:17,791
myself, of course--

617
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:20,541
- And the doctors.

618
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,083
- Some doctors use the pharmacy
as a shortcut...

619
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,291
But I know them.

620
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:30,541
- Could Celia Austin
have taken the morphine herself?

621
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,166
- I suppose so,

622
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,791
but Celia was very scrupulous.

623
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,583
It would have been
very unlike her.

624
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:37,916
- How about friends?

625
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,291
Did anyone ever visit her?

626
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,291
- There was one chap
who used to come and see her,

627
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,166
as a matter of fact,
but he was no outsider.

628
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:46,166
He was a medical student
working here.

629
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:51,124
- And what was his name, sir?

630
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:55,583
- Bateson, Leonard Bateson.

631
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,041
- Monsieur Leonard,

632
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:05,124
you and Mademoiselle Celia
were on the terms amicable?

633
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:06,708
- We were friends, yes.

634
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,541
- And sometimes you visited her
in the pharmacy?

635
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:11,916
- What, and stole the poison
while I was there?

636
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,874
Come on, Mr. Poirot,
what do you take me for?

637
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,666
- What were you doing
in her room last night?

638
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,916
- Who said I was?

639
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:20,958
- You'd be well-advised
to answer my question civilly,

640
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,708
Mr. Bateson.

641
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,083
- You can't intimidate me,
Chief Inspector.

642
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,249
Yes, I did go into her room.

643
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,208
I was looking
for my stethoscope.

644
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,333
- But Celia didn't take
the stethoscope.

645
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,416
- Yeah, that's what she said,

646
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,333
but it cost me a packet,
and I wanted to be sure.

647
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,916
- You mean
you searched her room?

648
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,708
- I had a quick look around.
It wasn't there.

649
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,583
- Monsieur Leonard,
you have not yet asked

650
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,166
what poison it was
that was stolen.

651
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:51,249
- You tell me.
- Morphine tartrate.

652
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,749
- Well, it wasn't me.

653
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,458
Oh, to hell with you.

654
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,166
I didn't take anything!

655
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,541
- Oh, here he is now.

656
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:09,166
- Just stand back, please,
and give him a chance.

657
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,749
Give us room, please.

658
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,249
- Have you examined
Sir Arthur yet?

659
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,541
- Not yet, not yet.

660
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,624
- How long will Sir Arthur
be staying here, Doctor?

661
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,708
- I have no idea.

662
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:18,874
- Will he be well enough
to meet

663
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,666
the Jarrow marchers
next week, Doctor?

664
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,208
- Really, Mr. Poirot,
these young people,

665
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,124
they have no respect
for anyone.

666
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,999
- It is a symptom
of the modern age, Miss Lemon.

667
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,041
- My God.

668
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,624
- Ah, the girl, it is
Mademoiselle Patricia Lane.

669
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,708
- No, not her,
the man she's speaking to,

670
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,499
I know him.

671
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,416
- Mr. Poirot.
- Mademoiselle Patricia.

672
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,708
- Miss Lane, that man
you were just speaking to...

673
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,666
- He's a friend
of Sir Arthur Stanley's.

674
00:40:58,959 --> 00:40:59,999
Well, you must have heard.

675
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,541
He's just been admitted here.

676
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,874
- You know Sir Arthur?

677
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:06,666
- No, but I'm studying politics.

678
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,583
Sir Arthur Stanley
has always been

679
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,999
something of a hero of mine.

680
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:14,208
He's changed British politics.

681
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,041
Why do you ask?

682
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:18,291
- No reason.

683
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:21,583
- Mademoiselle, you have heard,
of course,

684
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,499
about the death
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin.

685
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,041
- Yes.

686
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,749
I've just come
from Hickory Road.

687
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:30,999
Mrs. Hubbard told me.

688
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,416
It's ghastly.

689
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:34,708
- Tell me, mademoiselle,
you were not present

690
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,666
at the hostel last night?

691
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,249
- No, I'd been out.
I came back late.

692
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,874
- So you didn't see anything
that might help us?

693
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,916
- Well, there was one thing.

694
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,374
I don't know
if it means anything,

695
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,416
but as I got back,
I noticed somebody

696
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,958
coming out of the window
onto the fire escape.

697
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,999
- The fire escape?

698
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:55,166
- I don't want to get anyone
into trouble.

699
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,166
- Miss Lane.

700
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,791
- I know.

701
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,249
It was Sally.

702
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,416
Sally Finch.

703
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:08,208
I've often thought there
was something strange about her.

704
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,666
And it was her.
I'm sure.

705
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,541
- Do you know
where we could find her?

706
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,541
You were seen, Miss Finch.

707
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,083
- Well, I don't know
who told you that,

708
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,249
but it's complete nonsense.

709
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:37,791
I was in my room all night.

710
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,249
- But your room does open out
onto the fire escape.

711
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,458
- What of it?
I didn't go anywhere.

712
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,666
- Mademoiselle--
- Shh.

713
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,208
Mademoiselle Sally,

714
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,291
you are on the terms amicable
with the other students?

715
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:53,624
- Some of them.

716
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,208
I've just had a vacation
with Len Bateson:

717
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,708
a week in Amsterdam.

718
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,708
- This was before the rucksack
was stolen.

719
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,499
- It was taken
the same day we got back.

720
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,916
That was the day
the police came.

721
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:09,333
- The police?

722
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,124
- Sure, there'd been a murder
in Soho,

723
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:12,833
and they were checking
all the hostels.

724
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,458
- If the suspect
was young and foreign,

725
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,708
that would have been routine.

726
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,416
- All the same,
it is strange, is it not,

727
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:18,833
that the rucksack
should be taken

728
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,208
on the same day
of his visit?

729
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,499
- And the lightbulbs.

730
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,499
They went at the same time too.

731
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:26,499
- Huh.

732
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,333
Mademoiselle Sally,
you are here, I understand,

733
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,124
on a Fulbright scholarship.

734
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:34,749
- That's right.

735
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:35,999
- Hmm.

736
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:38,416
And, um...

737
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:45,333
You are studying, I see,
John Keats.

738
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,583
- Mm, yes.

739
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,333
He's my speciality.

740
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,249
- Let me see.

741
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:57,166
"And like a dying lady,
lean and pale...

742
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:02,124
Who totters forth,
wrapped in a gauzy veil..."

743
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:04,958
- You know your Keats.

744
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:11,583
- It is interesting
that Mademoiselle Sally--

745
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,083
- She was lying
about the fire escape.

746
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,374
- And there is more.

747
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:17,208
She professes
to be the expert on John Keats,

748
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,124
yet the lines
that I quoted to her...

749
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:22,458
- They were from Shelley.

750
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,999
- Poor Celia.

751
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,999
She wasn't that bright
or anything,

752
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:07,458
but I liked her.

753
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,708
- You were close?

754
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,958
- We were friends,

755
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,874
but we're all friends
at Hickory Road.

756
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,374
- Tell me,
Mademoiselle Valerie,

757
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,541
what is it that you do here
in the fashion house?

758
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,249
- At Sabrina Fair?

759
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:19,999
I'm working with them for a year
as part of my course:

760
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,333
fashion and design.

761
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,166
- Ah, well, then you assist
in the...

762
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:26,458
how--how do you say--

763
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,124
the displays of fashion?

764
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:32,541
- Yes, and they take me abroad,
to Paris, Milan.

765
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,249
I'm having a wonderful time.

766
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,499
- I'm sure.

767
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,666
- And this particular dress,
it is of your own design?

768
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:42,041
- Yes.

769
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:44,708
- Oh, Miss Lemon, régarde.

770
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,374
- How beautiful.

771
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,999
Did you make it yourself?

772
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,458
- Yes.

773
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,083
- What unusual stitchwork.

774
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,333
- One final question,
if I may, mademoiselle.

775
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,708
- What's that?

776
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,999
- Would it be of significance
if I were to tell you

777
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:07,499
that the cause of death
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin

778
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,916
was poisoning by morphine?

779
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:15,666
- No, not at all.

780
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,749
- Au revoir.

781
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,708
- Right, well,
I best be getting home.

782
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,916
- No, no, no, no, no.

783
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,999
No, Chief Inspector.

784
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:30,291
Tell me, the good Madame Japp,
she's still not returned?

785
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:31,624
- No.

786
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,791
- I thought as much.
- I also.

787
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,333
Et bien,
I have la bonne idée.

788
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,416
How would it be,
Chief Inspector,

789
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:44,083
if you and I were to have
dinner together this evening?

790
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,541
- Oh, I have to say, Poirot,

791
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,124
I could do
with a good square meal.

792
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,874
- Mind you,
it's a bit of a step back

793
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:51,833
all the way to Isleworth,
Mr. Poirot.

794
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,333
- I have an idea.

795
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,166
Alors, the simplest way
is to have the Chief Inspector

796
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:58,583
stay with me until the good
Madame Japp, she returns.

797
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,041
- What, stay with you?

798
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:04,499
- I can make up the spare bed.

799
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:09,166
- Well, that's very decent
of you, Poirot.

800
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,208
- You accept?

801
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:15,916
- Yes, with pleasure.

802
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,749
- You are settled in,
Chief Inspector?

803
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,041
- Yes, thank you, Poirot.

804
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,416
- I put him in the back room,
Mr. Poirot.

805
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:37,541
- Something smells good.

806
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:38,916
- Merci.

807
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,333
It is mon assiette de saveur.

808
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,083
It was a speciality of my mother
when I myself was a student.

809
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,624
- S'il vous plaît,
Miss Lemon.

810
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:50,041
- That's very kind of you,
Mr. Poirot.

811
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,749
- Chief Inspector.

812
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,208
- What's that thing
in the bathroom, Poirot?

813
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,291
- Comment?

814
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,708
- Like a, um, foot bath.

815
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,083
- Uh, the bidet.

816
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,624
- Oh, bidet.

817
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,541
It's got a sort
of fountain thing in the middle.

818
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:04,791
What's that for?

819
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:08,791
- Ah, it is of no significance.

820
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:10,874
- Nearly got a squirt in the eye
when I turned it on.

821
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:16,458
- It is best not to tamper
with it, Chief Inspector.

822
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,791
It is broken.

823
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,291
I will get the food.

824
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,583
- I must say, I'm looking
forward to this, Miss Lemon.

825
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,958
- You look like a man

826
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,999
in need of his dinner,
Chief Inspector.

827
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,041
- That thing in the bathroom,
though--

828
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:33,791
- It is best not to bother
Miss Lemon

829
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:37,291
with the deficiencies of
our plumbing, Chief Inspector.

830
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,958
Maintenent,
mon assiette de saveur.

831
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,333
Voilà.

832
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:53,458
- Well, you didn't tell them.

833
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,999
- Of course not.
- Nor me.

834
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,374
- Well, you know I didn't.
You were there.

835
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,916
- I don't think we can
just keep quiet about it.

836
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:01,916
- Why not?

837
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,416
- We can't.

838
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,499
We're gonna have to tell
Mr. Poirot.

839
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:10,083
- Ah, you here.

840
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,749
Yes, I also.

841
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:15,874
I have one small drink.

842
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:17,791
It's for my heart.

843
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,333
- Good night, Mrs. Nicoletis.

844
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,833
- I know.

845
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,249
I know what happened
is wrong.

846
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,541
- That's right.

847
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:28,791
- I go to the police.

848
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:32,041
I tell the truth before.

849
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:35,666
No more death.

850
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,583
- What's she on about?

851
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,541
- She's loaded, as usual.

852
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:44,291
- Colin.

853
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:46,708
- All right,
I had the morphine,

854
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,749
but you all saw what I did.

855
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:51,666
- Then you've got nothing
to worry about, have you?

856
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,916
- Well,
I'm not going to tell them.

857
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:58,083
- Well, if you don't,
maybe one of us should.

858
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,208
- I hate to say it, Colin,
but I think Nigel's right.

859
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,041
We have to tell Poirot.

860
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:05,708
- Why, for heaven's sake?

861
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,458
- Well,
in case it happens again.

862
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,749
- Oh, it's you.

863
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:40,624
Come in.

864
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,874
Everything is going wrong!

865
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,249
Why are you doing
these things?

866
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:54,333
It's not part of the plan!

867
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,374
Why you do these things?

868
00:50:56,667 --> 00:51:00,499
That girl Celia, you finish--
I will tell.

869
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,041
- Stabbed through the heart.

870
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:25,541
- With a precision
that is medical,

871
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:26,874
you might say, Chief Inspector.

872
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,541
- Now, there's a thought.

873
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,083
Leonard Bateson's training
to be a doctor, isn't he?

874
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,874
- Yes, indeed.

875
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,458
- What's going on, Poirot?

876
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,624
First Celia Austin pilfers
a whole lot of useless things--

877
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:41,833
- It wasn't Celia who stole
the lightbulbs or the rucksack.

878
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,499
- No, but someone kills her.

879
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:45,333
And now Mrs. Nicoletis,

880
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:50,124
who owns the hostel and has
got nothing to do with anything.

881
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:02,874
- There is something here
at Hickory Road,

882
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,833
something behind
these two deaths, we do not see.

883
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,458
- It's the middle of the night.

884
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,374
The hostel's locked
from the inside.

885
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,708
Mrs. Nicoletis opens her door
to whoever knocks.

886
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,833
- Then you believe
it was one of the students?

887
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:16,624
- It had to be.

888
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:20,333
- Yes, but which one?

889
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,333
- You've heard.

890
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,541
- Yes, of course.

891
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,083
Do the others know?

892
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,583
- No, most of them had left
before she was found.

893
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,791
- Look, I can't do this anymore.

894
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:50,874
I've had enough.

895
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,291
- Sally, we can't stop now,

896
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:54,624
not now, of all times.

897
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,333
- Someone's going to find out,
and I--

898
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:00,541
- Don't worry.
Nobody knows.

899
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:02,999
- What about this detective,
Poirot?

900
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:04,999
- Don't worry about Poirot.

901
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:06,916
I'll deal with him.

902
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:08,749
- You better.

903
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:10,666
- I promise.

904
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,874
I will.

905
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:24,291
- I never thought
that it would come to this.

906
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:27,791
First Celia, and then--

907
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,874
Oh, it's like a world gone mad,
Mr. Poirot.

908
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,124
- Come on, Florence.

909
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,416
Mr. Poirot will sort it out,
you'll see.

910
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:38,374
- What can you tell us about
your employer, Mrs. Hubbard?

911
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,624
- Not a great deal.

912
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,541
She was a very solitary person.

913
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:42,874
I rather think--

914
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:45,249
Well, I know
it's a wicked thing to say,

915
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:48,374
but I think she may have been
a secret drinker.

916
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,333
- After all the bottles
we found in her room,

917
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,833
there's no secret about it.

918
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,666
- And you told me, I think,
that she had other interests.

919
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:57,083
- Yes,
one or two student clubs

920
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,958
and a shop
just across the road.

921
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,874
- Which shop is that?

922
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:02,624
- It sells luggage.

923
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:06,124
A lot of our students
buy rucksacks there.

924
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:07,499
- Rucksacks?

925
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:08,916
Ah, yes, of course,

926
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,541
the rucksack belonging
to Monsieur Leonard Bateson.

927
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:13,291
- The one that was cut up.

928
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,916
- Yes...

929
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:19,249
On the day that the police
came to Hickory Road.

930
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:23,833
- Sir.

931
00:54:24,125 --> 00:54:26,583
- Excuse me.

932
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,291
- Two of the students
have come back

933
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,124
and would like to see you.

934
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,749
- I feel like a rat
coming to you.

935
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,249
- We all agreed.

936
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,208
- S'il vous plaît,
Monsieur Leonard.

937
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,583
Proceed, Monsieur Nigel.

938
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,291
- Well, it's like this.

939
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:49,208
About six weeks ago, we were
talking about crime and murder.

940
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,583
- Who were?

941
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,874
- I'm sorry, we all were--
Len, Pat, Celia, me,

942
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,208
the whole hostel.

943
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,708
- Colin had come up
with this theory

944
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,416
about how anyone
could get away with murder,

945
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:01,458
and now this has happened.

946
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,791
- Yes,
he spoke of some of this to me,

947
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,583
at the dinner, you remember?

948
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,249
- Yes, well,
we were ragging him about it,

949
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,416
and then somebody asked him

950
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:10,624
how he would go about
killing someone.

951
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:11,874
Colin said poison.

952
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,124
- Poison?

953
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,374
- Yes, I said
it would be impossible

954
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,541
to get ahold of a lethal poison,
but Colin disagreed,

955
00:55:18,834 --> 00:55:20,041
and that was when
we made the bet.

956
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:21,291
- What bet?

957
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,374
- Colin said he could produce
enough poison

958
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,624
to kill someone,

959
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:26,333
and he could do it
in a week.

960
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,166
- You mean he stole some poison?

961
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,666
- It was morphine tartrate.

962
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:31,958
He produced it a week later.

963
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,333
- None of us believed him
at first.

964
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:34,666
It was just white powder.

965
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:36,666
- I had a look at it.
It was what he said it was.

966
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,708
- And this poison,

967
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,833
what happened to it after
the bet, it was won?

968
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,333
- Well, Colin kept it
for a few days,

969
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,749
but we were all so nervous
about it.

970
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,499
In the end,
he flushed it down the toilet.

971
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:46,999
- Did you actually see him
do this?

972
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:49,124
- Yes.
- He did it in front of us.

973
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:51,249
- Now, let me get this straight.

974
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:54,374
Colin McNabb stole a phial
of morphine tartrate

975
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,624
just to prove a point?

976
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,999
- Yes.

977
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,583
I'm sure it's not as bad
as it seems.

978
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:04,249
- Personally, I don't see
how it could be worse.

979
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:07,666
- I was just proving a point,
that's all.

980
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:08,958
- Tell me, Monsieur Colin,

981
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,499
the poison,
from where did it come?

982
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:12,374
- Isn't it obvious?

983
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,416
From the pharmacy
at the hospital.

984
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:16,124
- Celia Austin gave it to you?

985
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,249
- No, I took it myself.

986
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,208
It was easy.

987
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,458
I'd been to the hospital,
and I seen how busy it was,

988
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,083
and I knew I just had to wait
for the right moment.

989
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,124
- Yes, well, I did date it.

990
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,833
- All it took was a white coat
and a stethoscope.

991
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,083
That's human psychology
for you.

992
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,624
To anyone who looked,

993
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:39,833
I was just another doctor
passing through.

994
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,208
- And the stethoscope,
from where had that come?

995
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,124
- I pinched it,
if you must know.

996
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:47,374
It was Len Bateson's.

997
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,791
- Ah, so that,
also, was not the work

998
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:51,166
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin.

999
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:53,041
- No, as she told you.

1000
00:56:53,334 --> 00:56:54,833
- What happened
to the stethoscope?

1001
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,666
- I left it in the hospital.

1002
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,708
I will get him a new one
eventually.

1003
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,458
What's all the fuss about?

1004
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:02,958
I didn't do anything wrong.

1005
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,208
- It was theft,
at the very least.

1006
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,333
- I mean,
I threw the poison out.

1007
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,083
Ask Nigel or Len.

1008
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,458
They were both there.

1009
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,791
- But you kept it, did you not,
for at least one week?

1010
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:15,333
- Yes.

1011
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,499
- And everyone in the hostel

1012
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:17,874
knew that it was
in your possession.

1013
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,041
- Yes, but--

1014
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:21,708
Oh, wait a minute.

1015
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,333
You think somebody
might have taken it

1016
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:24,791
and swapped it
with something else?

1017
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:28,041
- Oui, with the boracic powder,
which was harmless.

1018
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:31,749
That was one of the items
that was also stolen.

1019
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,708
- Then I threw away
boracic powder.

1020
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,499
- Who had access to your room,
Mr. McNabb?

1021
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:40,208
- Anyone.
I don't keep it locked.

1022
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,999
Now, look, I was just proving
a point, Chief Inspector.

1023
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:45,874
I didn't mean any harm.

1024
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,916
- You'll return now to
Hickory Road, Chief Inspector?

1025
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,999
- I'm gonna search that hostel
from top to bottom.

1026
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:55,999
Maybe I should have done it
from the start.

1027
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:58,458
- What is it that you expect
to find, Chief Inspector?

1028
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,999
- The remains of the poison.

1029
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:02,666
It only took a small amount
to kill Celia Austin.

1030
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:05,458
I'll wager the killer's
hung on to the rest.

1031
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,583
- That interview
with Monsieur Colin McNabb,

1032
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:16,124
it explains, at last,
why the boracic powder

1033
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,208
and the stethoscope,
they were both stolen.

1034
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,499
- Yes.

1035
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:21,208
- And all that remains
is the rucksack

1036
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,958
belonging
to Monsieur Leonard Bateson.

1037
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,666
- What, and you think
that's more important

1038
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,416
than the poison
that killed Celia Austin?

1039
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:30,624
- No, but I believe it was
the reason why she was killed.

1040
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,583
- Hickory Road.

1041
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,708
- Taxi.

1042
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:41,791
Hickory Road.

1043
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,374
Would you please to wait for me?

1044
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:20,749
- Good morning, sir.

1045
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:22,083
- Bonjour.

1046
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,083
If you please, I would like
to purchase a rucksack.

1047
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,166
- A rucksack, sir?

1048
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:27,208
- Oui.

1049
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:28,291
- Would it be for yourself?

1050
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,624
- Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1051
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,583
It is for my nephew.

1052
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,666
- This is the deluxe model.

1053
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:38,916
The Imperial, sir.

1054
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,749
It's very sturdy
but light.

1055
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:42,458
- C'est vrai.

1056
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,124
And this model of rucksack,
it is your most popular?

1057
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,083
- No, sir.

1058
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:52,208
Our most popular model
would have to be this one.

1059
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,499
It's good and stout,
and it'll stand a lot of wear,

1060
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,958
and it's half the price
of the Imperial.

1061
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,166
- Et bien.

1062
00:59:58,459 --> 00:59:59,708
This is the one I will choose.

1063
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,041
- I'll just get my assistant
to wrap it for you.

1064
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:03,874
- Mr. Casterman.

1065
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:22,833
- You can't do this.

1066
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,416
- If you'd told me about
that stolen poison earlier,

1067
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,833
Miss Hobhouse,
I wouldn't have had to.

1068
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,291
- I do have rights,
Chief Inspector.

1069
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:31,749
- So did Celia Austin

1070
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,958
and Mrs. Nicoletis,
for that matter.

1071
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,833
Perhaps you should think
of them.

1072
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,083
- Val, what's going on?

1073
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,374
- It's the police.

1074
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,833
They're searching
the whole place.

1075
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,041
- They can't!

1076
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:51,541
- They've just finished
in my room.

1077
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:53,833
Now they're in yours.

1078
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,874
- Chief Inspector.

1079
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,416
- Ah, Mr. McNabb.

1080
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:06,791
Just the man I wanted to see.

1081
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,499
- What? Why?

1082
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:11,083
- That poison of yours,
the morphine tartrate,

1083
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,083
you said you threw it away.

1084
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,958
- I did.

1085
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,083
- Then how do you explain this?

1086
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:19,083
- What is it?

1087
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,333
- I think you know what it is,
Mr. McNabb.

1088
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:25,583
- No.

1089
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,708
No!

1090
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,916
- Whitehaven Mansions,
if you please.

1091
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,208
Bonjour, Chief Inspector.

1092
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,374
How did you sleep?

1093
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,124
- I didn't.

1094
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,749
- But with Monsieur Colin McNabb
arrested for the crimes,

1095
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,291
you should have slept
to perfection.

1096
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,791
- Actually, Poirot,
it's the central heating.

1097
01:02:19,084 --> 01:02:21,333
- But it was on to
the full extent, mon ami.

1098
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,541
- Exactly.

1099
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,291
- You have seen the headlines?

1100
01:02:28,584 --> 01:02:30,624
- Ah, the Jarrow marchers,
yeah.

1101
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,166
- It says
that Sir Arthur Stanley

1102
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:34,666
is too ill to meet with them.

1103
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,416
- Hmm.

1104
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:42,916
- You told me once
that you met Sir Arthur Stanley.

1105
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,499
- Yes.

1106
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:52,499
- It was on a matter
for the police?

1107
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:54,666
- Yes.

1108
01:02:57,292 --> 01:02:59,999
Sir Arthur Stanley
may be the people's hero,

1109
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:02,916
the champion of the jobless,

1110
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:07,541
but ten years ago,
he murdered his wife.

1111
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:08,833
- Comment?

1112
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:11,374
- Yes,
and it was rather similar

1113
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,708
to this Celia Austin business.

1114
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,749
I'll tell you how it happened.

1115
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:22,499
Sir Arthur Stanley
was already famous.

1116
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:24,249
He'd just become an MP.

1117
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,666
Anyway, his wife was found dead

1118
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:27,916
from an overdose
of her sleeping powder,

1119
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:30,333
and although I was only
an inspector then,

1120
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,166
I was called in to investigate.

1121
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:34,583
They had a big place
over in Richmond,

1122
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,958
and the two of them
had lived there

1123
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,749
with their son
and a couple of maids.

1124
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,583
It could've been an accident.

1125
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,333
That's what everyone thought,

1126
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,999
but there was something
about Sir Arthur that--

1127
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:48,458
I don't know--
got my wind up.

1128
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,666
Who was in the house with your
wife last night, Sir Arthur?

1129
01:03:52,959 --> 01:03:57,749
- Oh, look, I've already
answered all these questions.

1130
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,458
- Please, sir.

1131
01:04:03,584 --> 01:04:07,583
Just myself, the maid, my son.

1132
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:11,583
- I will have to speak to them,
sir.

1133
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:15,374
- Well, the maid's here,
but I've sent my son away.

1134
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,791
He's only 16, for heaven's sake.

1135
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:19,583
He's upset!

1136
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,541
We're all upset.

1137
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,499
- And who actually
gave your wife

1138
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:32,708
her sleeping powder,
Sir Arthur?

1139
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,124
- No one gave it to her.

1140
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,833
She took it herself.

1141
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,374
- She measured the dose?

1142
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:47,208
- No, I did,

1143
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,708
but it was the correct dose,
I'm sure of it.

1144
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,333
- Then how do you explain
what happened, sir?

1145
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,624
Well, it's simple.

1146
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:03,124
She, uh--she took
the first dose,

1147
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,166
but she took it too early.

1148
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:07,833
Then she'd forgot
she'd taken it,

1149
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:11,124
and she took another one.

1150
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:13,624
So...

1151
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:15,958
It was an accident.

1152
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,541
- I've never heard such
a feeble story in all my life.

1153
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,583
He was hiding something,
that was for sure,

1154
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:27,333
but I wasn't gonna be given
the chance to find out what.

1155
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,624
- Just what do you think
you're doing, chap?

1156
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:34,499
This is Sir Arthur Stanley
we're talking about.

1157
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:36,541
You don't investigate
a man like that

1158
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,374
unless you got
a damn good reason,

1159
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:39,708
and as far as I can see,

1160
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,583
you haven't got any reason
at all!

1161
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,541
- Sir Arthur Stanley
had some pretty powerful friends

1162
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:47,333
high up in the labor party
and in the police.

1163
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,874
I was pulled off the case.

1164
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,083
It was an accident,

1165
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,416
and that was to be
the end of it.

1166
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,416
But I knew I was right,

1167
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:59,416
so I went back to the house
one last time.

1168
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:01,374
I still don't know
what I expected to find,

1169
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,458
but I'll tell you this, Poirot:

1170
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:07,291
I struck gold.

1171
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:10,208
He was talking
with his solicitor,

1172
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,499
a man called Endicott.

1173
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,541
- I had to do it.

1174
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:18,041
I had no choice.

1175
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,083
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,458
But can you live with it?

1177
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:28,291
- God help me,
I don't know.

1178
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:32,083
I don't know!

1179
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:34,541
Endicott,

1180
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:38,541
promise me you'll never tell.

1181
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:41,124
- I saw it with my own eyes,

1182
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:44,416
the two of them in it together.

1183
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:49,083
- And it was
this Monsieur Endicott

1184
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,749
that you saw
at the hospital yesterday.

1185
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:51,999
- Yes.

1186
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:55,249
That's one face
I'll never forget.

1187
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,833
- What do you think was in the
letter that passed between them?

1188
01:06:58,125 --> 01:06:59,083
- I don't know.

1189
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:02,958
Some means
of protecting himself, maybe.

1190
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,541
But as sure as eggs is eggs,
Sir Arthur killed his wife.

1191
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:07,083
- But what would have been
the motive

1192
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:08,999
for Sir Arthur
to have committed this murder?

1193
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,333
- Money.

1194
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,541
Lady Stanley was a rich woman
in her own right,

1195
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:14,208
and he got everything.

1196
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,083
Endicott knew that, of course.

1197
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,166
- And what did you do?

1198
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:19,541
- There was nothing I could do.

1199
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:21,541
I wasn't meant to be there.

1200
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,666
I couldn't prove
what I'd seen and heard.

1201
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,499
I was off the case.

1202
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,124
- Hmm.

1203
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,833
- Now, you realize
I could get the push for this.

1204
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:31,333
- Len, it's important to me.

1205
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:32,458
- Oh, yes, I know, I know.

1206
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,749
You and Sir Arthur Stanley.

1207
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,833
Anyone would think
you were related or something.

1208
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,583
- I've read everything
he's ever written,

1209
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,499
his whole life's work.

1210
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:43,874
I have to meet him,
just once.

1211
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:47,583
- I can give you five minutes,
Pat, that's all.

1212
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,541
- Thanks, Len.

1213
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:56,916
He's gonna die, isn't he?

1214
01:07:57,209 --> 01:07:58,999
- He's very sick.

1215
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:19,458
- Who are you?

1216
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,583
- Please, sir, don't be afraid.

1217
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:27,708
I suppose I'm an admirer
of yours, Sir Arthur.

1218
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,791
I just wanted to see
how you were.

1219
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:39,916
- You've done so much
for this country:

1220
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:44,749
with the labor movement,
your stand against Mussolini,

1221
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:48,249
your support
of the Jarrow marchers.

1222
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,249
- Baldwin won't see them,
you know,

1223
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,999
won't see them.

1224
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:57,499
Too scared.

1225
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:00,208
- They don't need Baldwin.

1226
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,291
They need you.

1227
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:04,583
You're their voice.

1228
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:08,583
- No, not now.

1229
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,041
- You'll get better, sir.

1230
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:15,499
You're needed.

1231
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:18,916
- I was.

1232
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:21,166
Yes.

1233
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:23,541
Great days.

1234
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,958
Behind me now.

1235
01:09:34,209 --> 01:09:36,999
Oh...

1236
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:39,583
Just...

1237
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,666
- Mr. Poirot?

1238
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,333
- Mr. Poirot!

1239
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,041
- Pardon, Miss Lemon.

1240
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:32,333
Good afternoon.

1241
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,458
- Are you all right, Mr. Poirot?

1242
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,749
- Yes, thank you, Miss Lemon.

1243
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:44,124
I am just discovering
that to cut up a rucksack

1244
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:47,041
requires much of the strength.

1245
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:51,874
Voilà.

1246
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,166
- What is it?

1247
01:10:58,334 --> 01:10:59,958
- The stitchwork, Miss Lemon.

1248
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,708
- You've cut right through it!

1249
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,541
- Mm-hmm, and between
the base and the inner lining,

1250
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,416
what is it that you see?

1251
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:10,374
- I don't see anything at all.

1252
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:11,958
- Uh-huh.

1253
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,666
Précisément.

1254
01:11:14,959 --> 01:11:16,333
That is exactly the point.

1255
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,333
Merci.

1256
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,083
- I thought I might make dinner

1257
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:23,916
for you and the Chief Inspector
this evening, Mr. Poirot.

1258
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:25,874
- Merci beaucoups.

1259
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,041
The Chief Inspector,

1260
01:11:27,334 --> 01:11:28,708
he has an appetite
that is most healthy,

1261
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,999
n'est-ce pas?

1262
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:31,666
- That's what I thought,
Mr. Poirot.

1263
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:32,749
- Ah, merci.

1264
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,291
- Half past 7:00, as usual?

1265
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,666
- I shall return
within the hour.

1266
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:50,041
- Mr. Poirot.

1267
01:11:50,334 --> 01:11:51,416
- Oui.

1268
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:53,333
- Get in.
- Comment?

1269
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:54,666
- Just get in.

1270
01:11:54,959 --> 01:11:57,749
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1271
01:11:58,042 --> 01:11:59,624
What is this?

1272
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,958
- Come in, Mr. Poirot.

1273
01:12:25,584 --> 01:12:28,083
- Hi, Mr. Poirot.

1274
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,999
- Sit down.

1275
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:39,874
My name is John Casterman.

1276
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:43,291
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

1277
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:45,416
- By assaulting me
in the open street?

1278
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:46,583
- You were about to ruin

1279
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:51,208
six months undercover
investigation...

1280
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:57,583
Besides putting the life
of one of my agents at risk.

1281
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:00,333
- Mademoiselle Sally.

1282
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,583
- Yes.

1283
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:03,499
- There was no danger of that,
monsieur.

1284
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,291
I was well aware
that Mademoiselle Sally

1285
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:08,499
was not what she claimed to be.

1286
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:10,083
- How?

1287
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,708
- You should have studied
perhaps more of your Keats.

1288
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,041
- Keats?

1289
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:17,416
- Tell me, Monsieur Casterman,
this work of yours,

1290
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:20,333
it involves investigating
the smuggling, n'est-ce pas?

1291
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,833
- Ah, yes, diamonds.

1292
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,874
- From Amsterdam and Paris.

1293
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,624
- We know who's buying them,

1294
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:28,416
but we don't know
who's bringing them in,

1295
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:30,208
and that's our first priority.

1296
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,208
- And it was for this reason
that you were working

1297
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,916
in the shop with the rucksacks
in Hickory Road.

1298
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:39,999
- Yes, to keep an eye on the
students intending to travel.

1299
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:43,458
We think it's the students
who are bringing them in.

1300
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,708
The trouble is,
we don't know who they are.

1301
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,374
- I will suggest that
that is something

1302
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:51,458
of which they themselves
are not aware.

1303
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,666
- I don't understand.

1304
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:58,083
- There is something strange
about the rucksacks

1305
01:13:58,375 --> 01:13:59,458
that come to Hickory Road.

1306
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,499
One, they are too cheap.

1307
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:03,833
Also, I myself cut to pieces
one of these rucksacks,

1308
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:06,499
and I'll tell to you
exactly what I found.

1309
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:07,791
- What?

1310
01:14:08,084 --> 01:14:10,041
- There is hidden
beneath the lining

1311
01:14:10,334 --> 01:14:11,708
a compartment
which is secret

1312
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,708
into which any amount
of diamonds may be placed

1313
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,083
without the owner having
any knowledge of the fact.

1314
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,041
- You mean the diamonds
are smuggled by people

1315
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,499
who have no idea
they're doing it.

1316
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:22,458
- C'est ça.

1317
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,541
- Leonard Bateson
had one of those same rucksacks,

1318
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:25,624
Mr. Poirot.

1319
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:26,999
It was stolen and cut up.

1320
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:29,958
- Oui, and I believe
that it was this one event

1321
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,333
that led to both of the
catastrophes which followed.

1322
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:36,458
- The deaths of Celia Austin
and Mrs. Nicoletis.

1323
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,291
- Oui.

1324
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:41,374
- Mr. Poirot, there is something
you should know

1325
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:42,958
about Mrs. Nicoletis.

1326
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,999
- Ah, you suspect
that she was the leader

1327
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:47,249
of the smuggling ring.

1328
01:14:47,542 --> 01:14:50,374
- We don't suspect.
We know.

1329
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,833
- It was her cousin,
Giorgios Nicoletis,

1330
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,624
who was buying the stuff.

1331
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:56,208
- C'est parfait.

1332
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,166
Madame Nicoletis, she owns
the shop with the rucksacks,

1333
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:01,291
and with her clubs
and the hostel for the students,

1334
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,499
she would have had access
to many of the young people.

1335
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,541
- But why did she have to die?

1336
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,916
- Parceque évidemment she knew
the identity of the killer

1337
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:09,416
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin,

1338
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:12,624
and to murder,
it was not in her plans.

1339
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:16,083
- And she panicked and
threatened to tell the police.

1340
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,208
- Mm.

1341
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,166
- But who was it?

1342
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,416
Which one of them
is the killer?

1343
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:25,499
- The killer, ah.

1344
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:29,291
The killer was the person
who felt compelled

1345
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:32,249
to steal the lightbulbs.

1346
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,458
- Typical Customs and Excise,

1347
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,874
they always have to do
everything cloak-and-dagger.

1348
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,958
- But Monsieur Colin McNabb,
he's still under arrest?

1349
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,416
- Well, he stole the poison
and kept it.

1350
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:46,833
And he had this bee
in his bonnet

1351
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,041
about a motiveless murder.

1352
01:15:49,334 --> 01:15:50,958
- So you believe
that Monsieur Colin McNabb,

1353
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,666
he murdered
Mademoiselle Celia Austin

1354
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,333
by way of the experiment?

1355
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:55,666
- Well, these psychologists,

1356
01:15:55,959 --> 01:15:57,999
most of them
are barmy themselves.

1357
01:16:03,084 --> 01:16:05,249
- Your health, Chief Inspector.

1358
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:07,208
- I don't suppose you've got
a nice glass of beer,

1359
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,458
have you, Poirot?

1360
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,083
- No, no, no, no, no.

1361
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,249
Besides,
the syrup of the banana,

1362
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:14,499
it is better
for the appetite.

1363
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,916
Santé.

1364
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:18,791
- Cheers.

1365
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:25,708
- Are you hungry,
Chief Inspector?

1366
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,916
- You can say that again,
Miss Lemon.

1367
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,666
I've been looking forward
to a healthy meal all day.

1368
01:16:30,959 --> 01:16:34,416
- And I've taken you
at your word.

1369
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:39,333
- What's this?

1370
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:44,208
- Filet of sole, poached
in milk, with boiled vegetables.

1371
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,374
You can't get much healthier
than that.

1372
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:51,333
- Sole, Miss Lemon?

1373
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,208
- Lemon sole.

1374
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:01,958
Who can that be
at this time of night?

1375
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,124
- If you please, Miss Lemon.

1376
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:09,041
Asseyez-vous, Chief Inspector.

1377
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:10,541
- You know,
it's very kind of you

1378
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,999
to put me up like this, Poirot,
but I was thinking--

1379
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:14,624
- Not at all, Chief Inspector.

1380
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:16,833
The pleasure, it is mine.

1381
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,791
And I insist
that you stay here with me

1382
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:24,124
until the good Madame Japp,
she has returned.

1383
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:27,124
- Oh, right.

1384
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:31,416
- Mr. Poirot, Chief Inspector.

1385
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:32,791
- Monsieur Nigel.

1386
01:17:33,084 --> 01:17:34,124
- Forgive me
for calling so late,

1387
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:35,374
but I had to see you.

1388
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,458
- Not at all.

1389
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,708
Miss Lemon.

1390
01:17:43,417 --> 01:17:46,166
Please do sit, Monsieur Nigel.

1391
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:57,791
- Mr. Poirot,
you've arrested the wrong man.

1392
01:17:58,084 --> 01:18:01,458
- Ah, it was not I who arrested
Monsieur Colin McNabb.

1393
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,041
- What makes you say that,
Mr. Chapman?

1394
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:04,374
- It's not me.

1395
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:06,749
I've just been talking to Pat,
Patricia Lane,

1396
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:09,833
and she knows who put the poison
back into Colin's room.

1397
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,291
- She's saying
he's being framed?

1398
01:18:11,584 --> 01:18:13,166
- Yes, and she knows who by.

1399
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,499
- Well, who?

1400
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,083
- She wouldn't tell me.

1401
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:17,499
She says I'd never believe her.

1402
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:19,416
- Why didn't she come here
herself?

1403
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:22,583
- She's frightened,
very frightened.

1404
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,291
She didn't want me to come,
but I said that--

1405
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:27,708
- Miss Lemon.

1406
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,374
- What now?

1407
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:35,791
- I told Pat she had to tell you
what she knew,

1408
01:18:36,084 --> 01:18:37,416
if only for Colin's sake,

1409
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:39,958
but she still wouldn't budge,
so I came myself.

1410
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,833
- It's Patricia Lane for you.

1411
01:18:45,584 --> 01:18:47,708
- Maybe she's changed her mind.

1412
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,999
Hello, Pat.

1413
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:52,249
- Why are you doing this, Nigel?

1414
01:18:52,542 --> 01:18:53,749
- I told you I'd come here,
Pat.

1415
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:56,083
If there's something you know,
you've got to tell them.

1416
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:58,541
Don't you see?
You could be in danger yourself.

1417
01:18:58,834 --> 01:18:59,791
The Chief Inspector's here.

1418
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:02,749
Why don't you talk to him,
Pat?

1419
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,624
- All right.

1420
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:06,333
- Chief Inspector.

1421
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:13,833
- Miss Lane.

1422
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,624
- Is that Chief Inspector Japp?

1423
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:16,916
- Yes, this is Japp.

1424
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:19,833
- Chief Inspector,
I know who killed Celia.

1425
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:22,624
You see,
I saw them with the poison.

1426
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:23,999
- And who was that, Miss Lane?

1427
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,166
- I was going past Colin's room,
and--

1428
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:29,291
It's impossible,
Chief Inspector.

1429
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:33,458
- Just tell me what you saw,
Miss Lane.

1430
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,249
Miss Lane?

1431
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,499
- Why didn't she come with me?

1432
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:08,041
I told her it wasn't safe
staying here

1433
01:20:08,334 --> 01:20:11,708
if she knew something.

1434
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,791
This is my fault.

1435
01:20:14,084 --> 01:20:15,458
I should have persuaded her.

1436
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:19,124
- There's no point
blaming yourself, Mr. Chapman.

1437
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:25,833
She wouldn't tell Nigel Chapman
what she knew,

1438
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,624
but maybe she told
somebody else.

1439
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:29,708
- Sir.

1440
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,791
- The murder weapon.

1441
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:35,999
- Yes.

1442
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:40,374
A paperweight in a sock:
simple but effective.

1443
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,874
- Yes, indeed.

1444
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:54,916
Regardez, Chief Inspector.

1445
01:20:55,209 --> 01:20:55,999
Mais fait attention.

1446
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:59,208
There is on it some blood.

1447
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,416
- That's Sir Arthur Stanley.

1448
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:03,208
- With his wife
and with his son.

1449
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,666
- Yes, but what's it doing here?

1450
01:21:07,959 --> 01:21:10,041
- And there is something else.

1451
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:20,291
There is trapped
in the fingernail a hair...

1452
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:25,916
A red hair.

1453
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:29,958
- Leonard Bateson.

1454
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,291
- Yes, I was here.

1455
01:21:32,584 --> 01:21:34,541
No, I didn't hear anything.

1456
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,333
- Who else was in the hostel,
Mr. Bateson?

1457
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,083
- I don't know.

1458
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:40,874
Ma Hubbard was upstairs,
I think,

1459
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,624
and Valerie
was somewhere around.

1460
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:44,166
- Tell me, Monsieur Leonard,

1461
01:21:44,459 --> 01:21:47,291
when was the last time
you saw Mademoiselle Patricia?

1462
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:48,999
- Funnily enough,
it was this morning.

1463
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:50,791
She was at the hospital.

1464
01:21:51,084 --> 01:21:53,708
- Do you know why?

1465
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,333
- Yes, she was trying to see
Sir Arthur Stanley.

1466
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,249
- Stanley?

1467
01:21:58,542 --> 01:22:02,499
- Were you able to assist her?

1468
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:07,624
- Yes, I sneaked her in
for five minutes.

1469
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:11,499
She'd always admired him,
and...

1470
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:16,333
She just wanted to see him,
that's all.

1471
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:19,291
- Chief Inspector,
without doubt,

1472
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:21,874
it was from Sir Arthur Stanley
that came the photograph.

1473
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,166
- Wait a minute, Poirot,
you're not saying that all this

1474
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:26,249
has got something to do
with Stanley, are you?

1475
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:28,499
- But it was you
who said the same thing.

1476
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:29,791
The death of Lady Stanley,

1477
01:22:30,084 --> 01:22:31,499
the murder
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin,

1478
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:32,999
there were similarities, no?

1479
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:36,833
- Don't tell me, then,
is he on your list of suspects?

1480
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:38,833
- Sir Arthur Stanley?

1481
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,416
He can't be.

1482
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:46,791
Oh, of course, there's no way
you would have heard.

1483
01:22:47,084 --> 01:22:52,458
Sir Arthur Stanley,
he passed away this afternoon.

1484
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:15,583
Ah, so that's what it's for.

1485
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,499
Bonjour, Chief Inspector.

1486
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:00,583
Vous avez bien dormir?

1487
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:01,749
- Mm?

1488
01:25:02,042 --> 01:25:03,124
- Oh, pardon,
you have slept well?

1489
01:25:03,417 --> 01:25:05,458
- Barely a wink, Poirot,
if you want the truth,

1490
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,583
until I cooled myself down
in that contraption of yours.

1491
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:10,874
- The bidet?

1492
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:12,874
- Mm, mind if I join you?

1493
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:15,749
I'm starving.

1494
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:18,249
- You hunger, I think,
for the truth, Chief Inspector.

1495
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:19,666
But concern yourself not.

1496
01:25:19,959 --> 01:25:22,333
The little gray cells,
they also did not sleep.

1497
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,916
The case, it is solved.

1498
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:26,249
- Is it?
- Oui.

1499
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:29,166
You must release at once
Monsieur Colin McNabb.

1500
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:31,583
- He's the only one who couldn't
have killed Patricia Lane.

1501
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:32,666
He was in prison.

1502
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:34,166
- Well,
what about Nigel Chapman?

1503
01:25:34,459 --> 01:25:35,708
He was with us.

1504
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,708
- You'll forgive me,
Chief Inspector, but your tie,

1505
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,166
it has on it
a spot of grease.

1506
01:25:44,459 --> 01:25:47,666
- Well,
it's the only one I've got.

1507
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:50,583
- I could lend you one
of Mr. Poirot's.

1508
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:54,374
- Ah, no, no, I can manage.

1509
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:56,499
Haven't got any bacon and eggs,
have you, Poirot?

1510
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:59,374
- Uh, no.
At this hour of morning?

1511
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:00,583
No.

1512
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:03,291
There is no time for the egg
and the bacon.

1513
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:06,208
It is time now
to close in the net.

1514
01:26:37,834 --> 01:26:40,083
There is no mystery
as to who was stealing

1515
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:45,958
most of the objects from
number 26 Hickory Road or why.

1516
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,208
Mademoiselle Celia Austin
confessed herself to me

1517
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,583
in the presence
of Monsieur Colin McNabb.

1518
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:54,749
She pretended to be
the kleptomaniac, but, in fact,

1519
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,333
it was only to attract
the attentions

1520
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,374
of Monsieur Colin McNabb that
she embarked on this exercise.

1521
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:01,249
- I still think
that's nonsense.

1522
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:02,833
- It's true.

1523
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,416
Cee would never have thought up
an idea like that on her own.

1524
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:08,541
- No, and I believe that the
idea, it was suggested to her.

1525
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,291
- Suggested to her?
Who by?

1526
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:13,708
- By the very same person
who arranged for the safe return

1527
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,124
of the diamond ring belonging
to Mademoiselle Patricia Lane.

1528
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:19,749
- But the ring turned up
in Val's soup.

1529
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:21,083
Anyone could have put it there.

1530
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:22,708
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

1531
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,374
No, for I will tell you
what I observed

1532
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:27,041
when I came here to the dinner.

1533
01:27:27,334 --> 01:27:30,749
Madame Hubbard prepared and
brought to the table the soup,

1534
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:32,874
and I saw then
that for the diamond ring

1535
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:34,958
to be found in the soup
of Mademoiselle Valerie,

1536
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,624
only two people could possibly
have placed it there:

1537
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:41,958
Madame Hubbard
or Mademoiselle Valerie herself.

1538
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,749
- And if it was me?

1539
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,791
- Then you must have
received the diamond ring

1540
01:27:47,084 --> 01:27:48,999
from Mademoiselle Celia.

1541
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,916
- You're right.
- What?

1542
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,333
- Oh, Colin,

1543
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,749
Celia was mooning after you
like a little ghost.

1544
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,749
You never even looked at her.

1545
01:27:57,042 --> 01:28:00,374
So I said to her,
"Become a case,

1546
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,499
"something he can study,

1547
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,791
then maybe you'll have
more luck."

1548
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:06,583
- It certainly worked.

1549
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:09,124
- Oui, but was it not the idea
to steal items

1550
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,666
only of the little worth?

1551
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,208
- Yes, but then she went

1552
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,291
and pinched that ring
from Pat's room.

1553
01:28:14,584 --> 01:28:16,541
I could see at once
how much it was worth

1554
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,583
and thought the police
might be called in.

1555
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:21,166
- Huh.

1556
01:28:21,459 --> 01:28:23,291
And so Mademoiselle Celia
gave you the ring

1557
01:28:23,584 --> 01:28:25,583
to return
to Mademoiselle Patricia Lane?

1558
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,208
- That's right.

1559
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,958
That business about the soup
was my idea.

1560
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,708
- This is all very well,
Mr. Poirot,

1561
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,999
but is this going to tell us
who killed Cee

1562
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,874
and Mrs. Nic and Pat?

1563
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:38,374
- Have patience,
Monsieur Chapman.

1564
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:40,333
Je vous en prie.

1565
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:41,708
When she came to visit me,

1566
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,166
Mademoiselle Celia Austin
claimed responsibility

1567
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:48,416
for only some of the thefts
from number 26 Hickory Road.

1568
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:50,833
S'il vous plaît, Miss Lemon.

1569
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,333
- She admitted taking the shoe,

1570
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:58,624
the bracelet,
the silk scarf,

1571
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,624
the cigarette lighter,
the cookery book,

1572
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:03,999
and the ring.

1573
01:29:04,292 --> 01:29:07,333
- And we can also eliminate
the stethoscope,

1574
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:12,499
which was removed
by Monsieur Colin.

1575
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:14,166
- What?

1576
01:29:14,459 --> 01:29:16,333
- Len, I can explain.

1577
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,083
I was going to pay you back.

1578
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,166
- He used it most ingeniously,

1579
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:23,666
when he took from the pharmacy
also the poison.

1580
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:26,749
- That just leaves three.

1581
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:27,874
Oui,

1582
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:31,083
the last three.

1583
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,499
And at this point,

1584
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:35,708
I would like to introduce you
to Monsieur Casterman,

1585
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,541
who, for many months, has
been investigating this hostel.

1586
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,749
- Investigating us?

1587
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,041
But why?

1588
01:29:44,334 --> 01:29:45,958
- I've been in charge
of an investigation

1589
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,333
into a smuggling ring, ma'am,

1590
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:49,791
and I had a strong belief

1591
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:52,791
that the late Mrs. Nicoletis
was a part of it.

1592
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:54,583
- Mrs. Nic?

1593
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:58,791
- Oh,
you must be making a mistake.

1594
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:01,458
- I don't think so.

1595
01:30:06,084 --> 01:30:07,083
- It's true, Ma.

1596
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,583
- Sally?

1597
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:11,749
- I work for Mr. Casterman.

1598
01:30:12,042 --> 01:30:13,791
- Sally.

1599
01:30:14,084 --> 01:30:15,999
- I'm sorry.

1600
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,791
- Mademoiselle Sally
was seen leaving the hostel

1601
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:21,958
by the fire escape,
and she used this means

1602
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,124
to report on the smuggling
to Monsieur Casterman.

1603
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:25,916
- What was being smuggled?

1604
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:28,749
- Diamonds.

1605
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,208
- The smuggling operation
involved the use

1606
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,374
of a certain type of rucksack,

1607
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:36,458
and this rucksack had in it
a compartment that was secret

1608
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,333
and was unknown even to the
person who might be wearing it.

1609
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:43,041
And it was this rucksack
which set off the events

1610
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:47,541
which led to the death
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin.

1611
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,874
For on this day,

1612
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:53,708
a new assignment of diamonds
had arrived from Amsterdam

1613
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,458
in a rucksack belonging
to Monsieur Leonard Bateson.

1614
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,958
Perhaps the policeman,

1615
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,958
he's coming to Hickory Road
to investigate,

1616
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:06,874
using the death in Soho
as an excuse to make a visit.

1617
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:10,708
The diamonds,
they are quickly retrieved,

1618
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,041
and the rucksack disposed of.

1619
01:31:16,334 --> 01:31:20,124
But our smuggler
had also a fear.

1620
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:22,916
It is essential not to be seen,

1621
01:31:23,209 --> 01:31:27,291
so instead, simplicity.

1622
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,791
Lightbulbs are removed from
certain points in the hostel.

1623
01:31:33,084 --> 01:31:35,541
- Oh, good evening, Officer.

1624
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:37,958
- So our smuggler is passed by
unnoticed by the policeman.

1625
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,249
- Students are waiting for you,
if you'd care to come this way.

1626
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:53,458
- But for all this care,
our perpetrator had been seen.

1627
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,041
Mademoiselle Celia Austin
had a room

1628
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:01,249
which overlooked the boiler room
in which the rucksack was found.

1629
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:06,041
She had seen everything.

1630
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,749
And I assume that she believed
that the person she saw

1631
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:11,874
was also responsible
for the other thefts.

1632
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:13,249
- That's right.

1633
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:15,541
The night she died,
she told us.

1634
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,124
She said she was sure
they'd come forward.

1635
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:21,499
- Hmm, and so, you see,
mesdames et messieurs,

1636
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:23,499
that Mademoiselle Celia Austin
was killed

1637
01:32:23,792 --> 01:32:27,749
because she had to be silenced,

1638
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,416
and the easiest way
to ensure that silence

1639
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:33,208
was for the killer to take
advantage of the morphine

1640
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,249
that had been stolen
from the hospital

1641
01:32:35,542 --> 01:32:38,083
by Monsieur Colin McNabb.

1642
01:32:42,084 --> 01:32:44,874
It was a simple task for
the killer to enter her room

1643
01:32:45,167 --> 01:32:47,208
and to exchange
her sleeping draft

1644
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:52,416
for a dose of morphine
that would be fatal.

1645
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:54,249
- God, it's all my fault.

1646
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:55,541
I should never have taken it.

1647
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:56,916
- No, but you threw it away.

1648
01:32:57,209 --> 01:32:58,249
We all saw it.

1649
01:32:58,542 --> 01:33:00,041
- No.

1650
01:33:00,334 --> 01:33:02,916
It was the harmless boracic
powder which was thrown away,

1651
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:06,541
for the morphine,
that had already been taken away

1652
01:33:06,834 --> 01:33:09,041
from Monsieur Colin McNabb
by someone who believed

1653
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,791
they might have reason
to use it one day.

1654
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:12,708
- But you found the poison
in Colin's room.

1655
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,208
- Ah, yes,
but that was after the death

1656
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,666
of Mademoiselle Celia Austin.

1657
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:18,666
You see, the poison
was returned to his room

1658
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:21,083
in an attempt
to incriminate him.

1659
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:24,583
- I'm sorry, Mr. Poirot, but
I can't bear this any longer.

1660
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:27,083
Who is the killer?

1661
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:37,041
- We have here two crimes:
the smuggling and the murder.

1662
01:33:37,334 --> 01:33:41,291
And it is with the smuggling
we must begin.

1663
01:33:41,584 --> 01:33:43,083
When I purchased the rucksack

1664
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:45,749
from the shop
owned by Madame Nicoletis,

1665
01:33:46,042 --> 01:33:49,499
I found in it
a secret compartment

1666
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:52,999
which was used
to conceal the diamonds.

1667
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:54,749
- What is it?

1668
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,541
- The stitchwork, Miss Lemon.

1669
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:02,083
- You've cut right through it.

1670
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,291
- The stitchwork,
it was very distinctive,

1671
01:34:04,584 --> 01:34:06,041
and it was
the good Miss Lemon

1672
01:34:06,334 --> 01:34:09,083
who had previously drawn it
to my attention.

1673
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:12,291
- What unusual stitchwork.

1674
01:34:12,584 --> 01:34:16,291
- I saw at once that
the stitchwork on the rucksack

1675
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:20,458
was the work of the same hand,

1676
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:25,249
your hand,
Mademoiselle Valerie.

1677
01:34:25,542 --> 01:34:27,124
Your work in the fashion house

1678
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:30,124
allows you to travel abroad
most frequently, n'est-ce pas?

1679
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:32,666
You also displayed a certain
knowledge of diamonds,

1680
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,291
which I found most revealing.

1681
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:37,208
For example, you knew at once
the value of the diamond ring

1682
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,124
belonging
to Mademoiselle Patricia Lane.

1683
01:34:39,417 --> 01:34:41,249
- No, it's all wrong.
You've got it all wrong.

1684
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,666
- Why don't you leave her alone?

1685
01:34:42,959 --> 01:34:43,958
- I didn't kill anyone.

1686
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:47,374
- No, not on your own, no.

1687
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:49,708
And I do not believe that
you have the nature to kill,

1688
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,041
but you were not acting alone,
were you, mademoiselle?

1689
01:34:52,334 --> 01:34:53,166
- She had an accomplice?

1690
01:34:53,459 --> 01:34:54,958
- Oh, yes, Chief Inspector.

1691
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,166
Madame Nicoletis, she was
head of the smuggling ring,

1692
01:34:57,459 --> 01:34:58,874
as was suspected
by Monsieur Casterman,

1693
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,874
but she had more than one young
person engaged in the business.

1694
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,291
- So who else was it?

1695
01:35:03,584 --> 01:35:05,166
- Hmm, there was a little clue
left for us,

1696
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:06,958
Chief Inspector,
with the third killing.

1697
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,458
The hair that was trapped in
the fingernail of the dead girl,

1698
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,124
what was the color
of that hair?

1699
01:35:11,417 --> 01:35:12,458
- It was red.

1700
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,124
- Ah.

1701
01:35:18,875 --> 01:35:20,541
- You think it was me?

1702
01:35:24,584 --> 01:35:28,458
I never went near her.

1703
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,374
- It is of no matter.

1704
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:33,291
Mademoiselle Patricia Lane,
she was struck down from behind,

1705
01:35:33,584 --> 01:35:35,541
so it would not have been
possible physically for her

1706
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:38,083
to even reach the hair
of her attacker.

1707
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:41,166
- So what are you saying?

1708
01:35:41,459 --> 01:35:44,333
- I have said it to you
once before, Monsieur Colin,

1709
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:45,874
that it is always
the little mistakes

1710
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:48,583
that the criminal ignores that
opens the door to the psychology

1711
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:52,833
and so to the crime,
and so it is here.

1712
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:55,958
The hair that was found
in the hand of the dead girl,

1713
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:00,749
it was an act of a killer
who is too clever, too daring.

1714
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:04,916
And this killer has spent
most of his life hiding a secret

1715
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:07,291
he will do anything to conceal,

1716
01:36:07,584 --> 01:36:10,624
and this secret drives him
to acts even more daring,

1717
01:36:10,917 --> 01:36:12,333
even more dangerous,

1718
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:16,541
that he cannot stop,
no, not even at murder.

1719
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:18,499
- Yes, but who, Poirot?

1720
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:20,458
Who are you talking about?

1721
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:28,708
- I am talking about the
young man in this photograph,

1722
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,041
Chief Inspector.

1723
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:33,374
- What photograph?

1724
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:35,041
- A photograph
that I took from the body

1725
01:36:35,334 --> 01:36:39,374
of Mademoiselle Patricia Lane
yesterday,

1726
01:36:39,667 --> 01:36:42,041
and the reason why
she had to die.

1727
01:36:46,084 --> 01:36:47,166
Mademoiselle Patricia Lane

1728
01:36:47,459 --> 01:36:50,791
was a fanatical admirer
of Sir Arthur Stanley,

1729
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:53,208
and it was when she visited him
in the hospital

1730
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,708
that she found the family album

1731
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,333
from which she removed
a photograph.

1732
01:36:59,584 --> 01:37:01,791
But why did she remove
this photograph, huh?

1733
01:37:02,084 --> 01:37:04,874
Because she saw
to her amazement

1734
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:08,499
the son of Sir Arthur Stanley,

1735
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,749
who was living
at number 26 Hickory Road

1736
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:13,333
under a name
that was assumed.

1737
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:16,416
- What name?

1738
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:18,791
Who is he?

1739
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,708
- Et bien, now that I have
removed the bloodstain

1740
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,416
from the photograph,

1741
01:37:25,709 --> 01:37:28,833
which obscured the identity
of his son...

1742
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:35,374
It is plain for all to see...

1743
01:37:38,292 --> 01:37:42,291
For it is you,

1744
01:37:42,584 --> 01:37:44,833
Monsieur Chapman.

1745
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,874
Do you deny that your true name
is Nigel Stanley?

1746
01:37:56,167 --> 01:37:57,249
- Come on, Mr. Poirot,
it's not a crime

1747
01:37:57,542 --> 01:37:58,499
to change your name,
you know.

1748
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,458
- No, Monsieur Stanley,
that was not your crime.

1749
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,708
- And besides,
you've got it all wrong,

1750
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,916
or have you forgotten?

1751
01:38:03,209 --> 01:38:04,291
I was with you
when Pat was killed.

1752
01:38:04,584 --> 01:38:06,916
- No, when you were with me,

1753
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:10,708
Mademoiselle Patricia Lane,
she was already dead.

1754
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,624
You come to us
with a story that, to me,

1755
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:15,083
is a concoction
of the most obvious.

1756
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:18,374
You mentioned the name Patricia
three times

1757
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:21,583
to convince us that it is her
with whom you speak.

1758
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:22,874
- Hello, Pat.

1759
01:38:23,167 --> 01:38:24,791
- Why are you doing this, Nigel?

1760
01:38:25,084 --> 01:38:26,833
- I told you
I'd come here, Pat.

1761
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:28,166
The Chief Inspector's here.

1762
01:38:28,459 --> 01:38:30,708
Why don't you talk to him,
Pat?

1763
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,958
- All right.
- Chief Inspector.

1764
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:36,291
- But it is not with
Mademoiselle Patricia Lane,

1765
01:38:36,584 --> 01:38:37,999
for that pauvre mademoiselle

1766
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:40,041
lies dead upon the floor
in her room.

1767
01:38:40,334 --> 01:38:41,666
- Yes, this is Japp.

1768
01:38:41,959 --> 01:38:45,166
- Chief Inspector, I think
I know who killed Celia.

1769
01:38:45,459 --> 01:38:47,999
- But it is easy, is it not,
to imitate her voice.

1770
01:38:48,292 --> 01:38:51,249
- You see, I saw them
with the poison.

1771
01:38:51,542 --> 01:38:54,708
- So who is it at the other end
of the line?

1772
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,458
- I was going past Colin's room,
and--

1773
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,916
It's impossible,
Chief Inspector.

1774
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,124
- It is your accomplice,

1775
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:12,083
Mademoiselle Valerie Hobhouse.

1776
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,291
- I never wanted any part in it,

1777
01:39:25,584 --> 01:39:27,208
not the killing.

1778
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,416
That was him.

1779
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:29,833
- Shut up, you little fool.

1780
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,791
- I'm sorry, Nigel,
but I can't go on anymore.

1781
01:39:33,084 --> 01:39:34,499
- He's got nothing on you, see?

1782
01:39:34,792 --> 01:39:36,083
It's all just talk.
He's got nothing.

1783
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:37,874
- No.

1784
01:39:42,084 --> 01:39:45,583
I want to tell you everything,
Mr. Poirot.

1785
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,624
I want to make a statement.

1786
01:39:52,584 --> 01:39:55,333
A mouse!

1787
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,374
- After him!

1788
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:06,333
- Go!

1789
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:14,458
- Don't let him get away!

1790
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:35,208
- All right, fan out, lads.

1791
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,333
Don't let him double back.

1792
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,833
- Hey!

1793
01:41:19,417 --> 01:41:21,999
- All right, son,
you've got nowhere to go.

1794
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:31,791
No!

1795
01:41:32,084 --> 01:41:34,083
- No!

1796
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:44,833
- We gather together
on this sad day

1797
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:49,166
to bury a man whose tragic death
has foreshortened a life

1798
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:53,708
that promised so much
to those who believed in him.

1799
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,208
But in their long quest
for justice,

1800
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:01,083
I know Sir Arthur lives on.

1801
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:04,499
Will you all please rise?

1802
01:42:33,334 --> 01:42:34,666
- Ah, Monsieur Endicott.

1803
01:42:34,959 --> 01:42:36,291
- Mr. Poirot.

1804
01:42:36,584 --> 01:42:38,249
- You have reflected
on what I've said?

1805
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:43,124
- Yes, and I have no objection
to your having this,

1806
01:42:43,417 --> 01:42:44,958
Chief Inspector.

1807
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,208
- What is it?

1808
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,041
- It is a confession,
is it not?

1809
01:42:49,334 --> 01:42:50,749
- That's right,

1810
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:53,624
the confession of that man,
Nigel Stanley,

1811
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:58,749
to the murder of his mother,
Lady Stanley, by poison.

1812
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,416
- Merci, monsieur.

1813
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,874
- He killed his mother?

1814
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:10,541
- Don't look so shocked, Ma.

1815
01:43:10,834 --> 01:43:13,083
- But why?

1816
01:43:13,375 --> 01:43:15,333
- I stole money from her,

1817
01:43:15,625 --> 01:43:18,708
not once, quite a few times.

1818
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,624
Eventually she threatened
to call the police,

1819
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:25,708
and when she caught me again,
well, I had to stop her.

1820
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,208
She really was
going to turn me in.

1821
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,541
- And your father
knew it was you.

1822
01:43:31,834 --> 01:43:33,833
- He made me
write a confession,

1823
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,666
and if my name ever appeared
in connection with any crime,

1824
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:38,666
no matter how trivial,

1825
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:40,874
that confession would be
delivered to the police.

1826
01:43:41,167 --> 01:43:42,333
- And that was why
it was so important

1827
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:45,291
to keep your identity
unknown.

1828
01:43:49,209 --> 01:43:53,291
- I think you'd better go
and pay your respects.

1829
01:43:53,584 --> 01:43:56,583
- It was very nice of you
to bring me, Chief Inspector,

1830
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,416
but I've really
no respects to pay.

1831
01:44:05,709 --> 01:44:09,583
- It is most kind of you to
invite me here, Chief Inspector.

1832
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,874
- After staying with you
for a whole week, Poirot,

1833
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:15,666
the least I could do
is offer you a spot of lunch,

1834
01:44:15,959 --> 01:44:18,499
wean you away from that--

1835
01:44:18,792 --> 01:44:22,416
Well, let you taste
some proper English cooking.

1836
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:25,374
- And the good Madame Japp,
it is today that she returns?

1837
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:28,124
- Yes, about 3:00.

1838
01:44:29,459 --> 01:44:35,083
- There,
now, that is what I call food.

1839
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:37,333
That's your mashed potato.

1840
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:40,833
This is your peas--
mushy peas, we call 'em.

1841
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:42,083
You'll love 'em.

1842
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:45,999
And this,
the pièce de résistance:

1843
01:44:46,292 --> 01:44:48,708
faggots.

1844
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,083
- Faggots?

1845
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:52,124
- Faggots.

1846
01:44:52,417 --> 01:44:56,291
And there's spotted dick
for afters.

1847
01:44:56,584 --> 01:44:57,666
- Dick?

1848
01:44:57,959 --> 01:45:01,416
- Yes,
it's called that because...

1849
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,416
- This is tragic,
Chief Inspector.

1850
01:45:07,709 --> 01:45:09,333
- No, no, it's fine.

1851
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:12,124
- I can eat
none of this wonderful food.

1852
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:14,999
- What?
Why?

1853
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:19,583
- Because I have an allergy
of the faggot.

1854
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:20,833
- An allergy?

1855
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,124
- Oui.

1856
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:23,999
I-I do not know how you say it
in English,

1857
01:45:24,292 --> 01:45:27,999
but in Belgian
it is known as...

1858
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,124
la phobie de faggot.

1859
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:31,708
- I never heard of that.

1860
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,791
- I'm so sorry, Chief Inspector.
I should have warned you.

1861
01:45:35,084 --> 01:45:37,874
- Well, this is a blessed upset,
I must say.

1862
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:41,624
Still, you can have
some spotted dick.

1863
01:45:41,917 --> 01:45:44,499
You haven't got
a phobie de dick, have you?

1864
01:45:44,792 --> 01:45:46,208
- No.

1865
01:45:51,334 --> 01:45:53,583
Some cheese?

1866
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:55,333
- I'll have a look.

1867
01:45:57,792 --> 01:46:01,083
- Just some camembert,
a little brie, perhaps?

1868
01:46:06,125 --> 01:46:07,708
Bon.

1869
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:12,541
- Nothing like a nice bit
of mousetrap.
