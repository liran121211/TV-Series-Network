1
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:46,673
1925, and the Prince of Wales
embarks on his tour

2
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,256
of the Indian subcontinent,

3
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:53,256
the welcoming cheers that greet
the heir to the imperial throne

4
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:55,507
prove positive
that India remains

5
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,299
just as steadfastly loyal
to the Crown

6
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:01,342
as it was in the days
of his great-grandmother

7
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,008
Queen Victoria.

8
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,396
- Wait there a minute.

9
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:32,188
- Sir.

10
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:38,522
- Which is the lady
that I must seize upon?

11
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,939
- This same is she,
and I do give you her.

12
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,398
- Why, then she's mine.

13
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,731
Sweet, let me see your face.

14
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:48,899
I am your husband,
if you like of me.

15
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:52,732
Give me your hand
before this holy friar.

16
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,900
- Soft and fair, friar.

17
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,483
Which is Beatrice?

18
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,233
- I answer to that name.

19
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,025
What is your will?

20
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,276
- Do not you love me?

21
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:05,859
- Why, no,
no more than reason.

22
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,240
Do not you love me?

23
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,698
- Troth, no,
no more than reason.

24
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:12,574
- Why, then my cousin, Margaret,
and Ursula are much deceived,

25
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,033
for they did swear you did.

26
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,524
Oh, what a totally ghastly
audience.

27
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:38,193
I didn't think
they were too bad.

28
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:44,419
- And now for another
transformation scene.

29
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:51,070
How to make myself
look respectable

30
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,278
for Government House.

31
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,987
- Oh, I'm so excited!

32
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,984
- Me too.

33
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,734
- Is Mr. Blunt waiting?

34
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,943
- He better be.

35
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,485
- You're quite serious
about him, aren't you?

36
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:04,735
- I know you don't approve.

37
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,819
- Oh, it's not my place
to approve.

38
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,502
- Oh, don't be
so mamby-pamby, Mabelle.

39
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,910
You think he's not good enough
for me.

40
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:12,560
- I just don't understand you.

41
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,351
I mean, you're so ambitious,

42
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,643
and with your background,
you could--

43
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,186
Who is it?

44
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:22,569
- Come in.

45
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:26,737
- Well, come on, girls.
The prince is waiting.

46
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:33,388
- The young prince
immerses himself wholeheartedly

47
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:36,347
in the exhausting schedule
of duties entailed

48
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,388
in such a great enterprise.

49
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,806
In the stifling heat
of an Indian midsummer,

50
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:43,431
the grandest reception of all

51
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:47,740
is held at Government House,
Calcutta.

52
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,612
- There she is.

53
00:04:57,738 --> 00:05:00,320
Why aren't you dancing, Mabelle?

54
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,738
- Oh, it's so hot in there.

55
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:05,571
Did you meet the Prince
of Wales, Mr. Blunt?

56
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:09,321
- No, never got closer
than five yards.

57
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:11,030
- We've got something
to tell you.

58
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:13,114
- Oh, no, Gerda, please.
You promised--

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,905
- Alistair wants it kept secret
from his stuffy family,

60
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,156
but we're going to be married!

61
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,531
- Oh.

62
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:22,698
Oh, that's wonderful.

63
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,936
Congratulations, Mr. Blunt.

64
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,020
When will this be?

65
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,520
- Quite soon, actually.

66
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:32,103
Alistair's bank want him
back in London next month.

67
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:33,812
Oh, come on, Alistair.

68
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:36,229
I want to dance!

69
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,562
- Excuse us, please,
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

70
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:47,055
- And so at last,
time to say good-bye.

71
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:51,139
As he leaves India, the jewel
of Britain's vast empire,

72
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,472
the prince can look back
with pride

73
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,723
at a job well done.

74
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,973
We'd like to join
with the people of India

75
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:02,807
in saying thank you and
God bless the Prince of Wales.

76
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,812
- Sit yourself down, Mr. Poirot.

77
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,410
Quite comfortable?

78
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,473
We'll start the preparatory work
today, Mr. Poirot.

79
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,723
- I'm so sorry to have kept you.

80
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,974
- Oh, that's all right.

81
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,474
Mr. Morley asked me
to make another appointment.

82
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,332
- Ah.

83
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:17,122
What about... the 6th of August
at 11:45, Miss Sainsbury Seale?

84
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:21,756
- Uh, yes, that looks perfect.

85
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:48,618
- Should I get out here
and take a cab, Uncle Alistair?

86
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,578
- No, no, it's all right.
I'll walk back to the office.

87
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,286
Keep the car.
Finish your shopping.

88
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,286
As long as I have it back
by half past 5:00.

89
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,337
- Excuse me. It's Alistair Blunt, isn't it?
- Yes?

90
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:04,412
- You don't remember me. Mabelle.
Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.

91
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:08,471
- I was your wife's friend.
- Yes.

92
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,221
Yes, of course I remember you.

93
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,506
Um, I'll see you at home later,
then, Jane.

94
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:18,556
- It was in India, if you remember.
Gerda and I were on tour together.

95
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:20,232
I've only just come back
after all these years.

96
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:25,515
Oh, I've been doing work for
the zenana missions, you know.

97
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:27,048
- Well, it's wonderful
to see you again,

98
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,049
Miss Sainsbury Seale,
it really is, but I--

99
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:31,799
- I'd love to see Gerda again.

100
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,186
- Miss Seale.
- Sainsbury Seale. Yes?

101
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,812
Why, Mr. Amberiotis.

102
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,854
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
recognize you for a moment.

103
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,770
How nice.

104
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,938
- I came to return...this.

105
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:56,363
- My hot water bottle.

106
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:01,856
Oh! What must you think. This
gentleman and I were on the boat

107
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,981
coming back from India together.

108
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:08,471
I lent him my hot water bottle
when he had a toothache.

109
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,622
Have you been to a dentist yet

110
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:19,414
about that tooth,
Mr. Amberiotis?

111
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:22,832
- Not yet, no. It
doesn't hurt so much.

112
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,998
- That's very naughty of you.

113
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,333
You must go and see my man,
Mr Morley in Harley Street.

114
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,124
As a matter of fact,
it's rather a coincidence.

115
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,326
I saw him only this morning,
and as I was coming out,

116
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,830
I ran into another old friend
from India--

117
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:39,747
but from much longer ago,
of course.

118
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,497
His wife and I were together

119
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,498
in the touring company
I told you about.

120
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:47,423
- Oh, yes, yes. When
you were an actress.

121
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,523
- Quite.

122
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,095
And he's done awfully well,
I believe, since then.

123
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,637
Mr. Alistair Blunt.

124
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:56,054
- Mr. Alistair Blunt the banker?

125
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,804
- I believe so.

126
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,513
He certainly used to work
in a bank when he met Gerda.

127
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,263
- Gerda?

128
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,621
- His wife.

129
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:09,772
Oh, we were such pals. Of course,
she was a better actress than I.

130
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:12,606
I always said she'd get on
in the profession,

131
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:18,382
but she left it to marry Alistair,
and I left it to stay in India.

132
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,329
- Thank you, sir.

133
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,122
- Hold tight, please.

134
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,716
- Oh.
- Yes, ma'am.

135
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,103
- My name's Sainsbury Seale.

136
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,312
I want to see Mrs. Blunt. She's
staying with Mrs. Chapman.

137
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,728
- Mrs. Chapman, right.

138
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,813
This way, ma'am.

139
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,938
Number 45, ma'am, just there.

140
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:08,272
- Thank you so much.

141
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,190
Gerda!

142
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:18,731
After all these years.

143
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,861
- Where are you going
with those?

144
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:32,778
- Miss Sainsbury Seale
telephoned, miss.

145
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,361
She's moving
to the Carlisle Hotel

146
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,279
in South Kensington,
wants her bags sent on.

147
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:40,237
- Oh, yes.
Go on, then.

148
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,989
- That damn boy's late again.

149
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:58,573
And smoking
on the front doorstep.

150
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:04,199
Young people nowadays--
unreliable, self-centered.

151
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:07,133
The girls are as bad.

152
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,195
Gladys isn't coming in today.

153
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:11,653
Her aunt's had a stroke, and
she's had to go up to Yorkshire.

154
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,028
- That's hardly
the girl's fault.

155
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,738
- She's been different lately.

156
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,696
It's that Frank Carter fellow.

157
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,905
- Girls do fall in love, Henry.

158
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:23,914
- Love?

159
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,039
She's a cut above him,
I should hope.

160
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,197
You know he's in
with that Blackshirt mob.

161
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,490
Anyway, she shouldn't let it
affect her efficiency

162
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,073
as my secretary.

163
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,765
Let her fall in love
in her own time.

164
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,222
- Good morning, Mr. Amberiotis.

165
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,806
Is everything all right, sir?

166
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,640
- What?

167
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,932
No.

168
00:14:56,058 --> 00:15:00,974
Yes, it's just a...toothache.

169
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,900
Take it away.

170
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,241
- Thank you.

171
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:29,661
- Mr. Porridge?

172
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,993
- Till the end
of the financial year.

173
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,576
- Thank you, Charles.

174
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,660
Any other business?

175
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,452
- There's the question
of the debenture issue.

176
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,660
- That was covered
on the agenda.

177
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,095
- Yes, but we left
the date open.

178
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,703
- Quite. That's all, I think.

179
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,187
Meeting closed. Thank
you, gentlemen.

180
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,101
- All right, Alistair?

181
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:25,476
- All right?
Yes, I'm fine.

182
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:29,309
- Can I give you a lift?
- No, my car's waiting. I'm going to the dentist.

183
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,435
- I see. That's why you were
in such a bad mood.

184
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,744
- We'll get your treatment
finished today, Mr. Poirot.

185
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,653
Now, as I was saying,

186
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:42,858
the important people,
they're always on time.

187
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,567
Now, I've got a most important
man coming this morning.

188
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:49,401
- Mr. Alistair Blunt.
- Alistair Blunt?

189
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,818
- Oh, yes. Always on time.

190
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:55,019
Nice, unassuming fellow.

191
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:58,002
Often sends his Rolls away
and walks back to the office

192
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,419
just like you and me.

193
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,470
You would never dream
he could buy up half Europe.

194
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:24,969
Well, good-bye, Mr. Poirot.

195
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,302
Wasn't too bad this time,
was it?

196
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,427
- No.

197
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:28,802
- Shall I ring for the lift
for you?

198
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,469
- No, no, no, thank you.
I shall walk down.

199
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:33,303
- I'll see you in six months.

200
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,033
- Mr. Blunt.

201
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:10,451
- Excuse me.

202
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:26,370
- Ooh!

203
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:28,995
- Oh!

204
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,878
- So kind.

205
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,253
- Not at all, madame.

206
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:35,294
- Ooh!

207
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,211
- Oh, dear.

208
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,461
- Thank you.

209
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:41,587
- You're welcome, madame.
- Thank you so much.

210
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:50,068
- I have an appointment
with Mr. Morley.

211
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,152
- Name?

212
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,944
- Miss Sainsbury Seale.

213
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,960
- Well?

214
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:02,961
I have now been waiting
for 45 minutes.

215
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,753
My appointment
was for half past 12:00.

216
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,045
- Well, I know--

217
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:09,211
- I shall now go back
to Worthing!

218
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:13,712
You may tell Mr. Morley
that I am most displeased.

219
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:21,172
- "I am most displeased."

220
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,938
Oh, my god.

221
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:22,983
- Revolver grasped
in lifeless fingers.

222
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,567
Doesn't seem to be much doubt
about it, does there?

223
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,442
It has to be suicide.

224
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,485
- C'est incroyable.

225
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:38,152
- All right,
you can move him now.

226
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:41,319
- So tell me,
Chief Inspector Japp.

227
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,861
- Lived upstairs
with his sister.

228
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,028
Hasn't been moody or depressed.

229
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:47,944
I wondered
if you'd noticed anything

230
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,237
when you saw him this morning.

231
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,362
- Nothing at all.

232
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:54,612
He was, what shall I say,
normality itself.

233
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:58,363
When did it occur, this tragedy?

234
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:00,155
- Can't say exactly.

235
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:02,488
Nobody seems to have heard
the shot.

236
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:07,406
It was discovered about 1:30
by the pageboy, Alfred Biggs.

237
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:09,114
- At what time
did Monsieur Morley

238
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,157
last press the buzzer
for a new patient?

239
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:14,323
- 5 past 12:00,
and the boy showed up

240
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:18,866
the patient who was waiting,
a Mr. Amberiotis,

241
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:22,324
staying at the Astoria Hotel,
according to the appointment book.

242
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,325
- And at what time did he leave,
this Monsieur Amberiotis?

243
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:27,825
- Well, the boy
didn't show him out,

244
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:29,117
so he doesn't know.

245
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:32,434
But I rang up the Astoria,
and Mr. Amberiotis says

246
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,626
he looked at his watch
as he closed the front door

247
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:37,126
and it was exactly
25 past 12:00.

248
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,800
- So at 25 minutes past 12:00,

249
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:42,634
our dentist,
he is the normal dentist, eh--

250
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,634
cheerful, competent, urbane.

251
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,884
And the very next moment,
despair, misery, what you will,

252
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,677
and he shoots himself?

253
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,802
No.

254
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:54,052
- It's quite incredible to me

255
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,553
that my brother
should have committed suicide.

256
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,011
- He'd been quite
his usual self, had he, madam?

257
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:01,803
Not upset in any way?

258
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,012
- He was annoyed.

259
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,970
He had a busy day
in front of him,

260
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,220
and his assistant
had received a telegram

261
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,345
to say her aunt had
had a stroke.

262
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:12,805
She left for Yorkshire
by an early train.

263
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,346
- And your brother,
he was annoyed at this?

264
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:18,638
- Well, the fact is...

265
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:22,572
His assistant's got engaged to
a rather unsuitable young man,

266
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,889
and it occurred to Henry
that this young man

267
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,873
had persuaded her
to take the day off.

268
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,807
- What does he do,
this young man?

269
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:34,266
- Frank Carter is--or was--
an insurance clerk.

270
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:37,533
He lost his job a few weeks ago
and seems unable to get another.

271
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,974
- Did your brother try and persuade
her to break off her engagement?

272
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,725
- Oh, yes, he did,
as a matter of fact.

273
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:47,184
- So this Frank Carter would
quite possibly have a grudge

274
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,392
against your brother.

275
00:24:48,676 --> 00:24:51,776
- It's that Miss Neville. She's
back in a rare taking, she is.

276
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:53,551
- The whole thing was
a wicked practical joke.

277
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,651
There wasn't anything wrong
with Auntie at all.

278
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:57,969
She couldn't understand it
when I suddenly turned up.

279
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:02,543
- Are you quite sure it wasn't your
friend Mr. Carter who sent this telegram?

280
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,252
- Frank?
Whatever for?

281
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,744
Oh, I see what you mean.
A put-up job between us.

282
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,460
We wouldn't do
a thing like that.

283
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:15,753
- Tell me, mademoiselle, what
patients had Mr. Morley this morning?

284
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:18,961
- They're all in here.

285
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:27,315
Um, at 10:00, Mrs. Soames
about her new plate.

286
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:30,273
10:30, Lady Gregson.
She's an elderly lady.

287
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,982
11:00, Mr. Hercule Poirot.

288
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:35,524
Oh, that's you, isn't it?

289
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,566
11:30, Mr. Alistair Blunt--
you know, the banker.

290
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:42,625
Then Miss Sainsbury Seale.
She's just back from India.

291
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:46,609
12:00, Mr. Amberiotis.
He was a new patient,

292
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:50,151
made his appointment
from the Astoria Hotel.

293
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:54,068
And 12:30, Mrs. Pinner.
She comes up from Worthing.

294
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,596
- If you please, Alfred,
tell me,

295
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,929
is it possible
for anyone to enter the house

296
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,512
without you
having to let them in?

297
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:02,971
- Nah.

298
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,346
No, not a chance.

299
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:06,597
Well, not unless they got a key,
anyway.

300
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:09,347
- But it is quite easy for them
to leave the house.

301
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:11,555
- Oh, yeah.

302
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:13,806
Yeah, most of them
come down the stairs

303
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:16,139
while I'm taking the new party
up in the lift, see.

304
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:18,723
- Did you see Mr. Amberiotis
leave?

305
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,224
- Nah.

306
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,099
No, he must have
let himself out.

307
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:23,974
- But you are quite sure
that nobody else came

308
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,199
to the house this morning,
only the patients.

309
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:28,350
- That Mrs. Neville's young man
came round.

310
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:30,875
In a bit of a paddy, he was,
not to find her here.

311
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,550
- We haven't heard about this
before.

312
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,259
- Well, when I told him Miss
Neville was out for the day,

313
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:39,984
he got quite shirty, said
he'd wait and see Mr. Morley.

314
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:44,427
Well, then he went into the waiting room.
You must have seen him there, sir.

315
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:48,460
- Ah, yes. The troubled young
man who would not sit down.

316
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,628
- Yeah, must have got tired
of waiting, I suppose.

317
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:54,086
He wasn't there later.

318
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:57,617
- Why, Chief Inspector Japp,
an officer of your eminence,

319
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:00,617
is he usually called in
to a case of apparent suicide?

320
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:02,076
- Alistair Blunt was here.

321
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:05,535
Mr. Blunt is the kind of person
we take care of in this country.

322
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,202
- You mean that there are
certain people

323
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,535
who would like him
out of the way?

324
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:09,702
- You bet there are.

325
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,953
The Reds, to begin with. And
our Blackshirted friends.

326
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,578
This Blunt and his group
have a standing

327
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,203
behind the present government.

328
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,953
- That is more or less
as I guessed.

329
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:25,029
Tell me something about
Monsieur Blunt, Chief Inspector.

330
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:26,612
- Alistair Blunt?

331
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,238
He controls all
the Arnholt interests in Europe

332
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:31,446
as well as the merchant banks.

333
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:34,196
He married into the family.

334
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:36,656
We oughtn't spend too long
with him.

335
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,572
I want to get on to the Astoria.

336
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,197
As it stands at the moment,
this Mr. Amberiotis

337
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:44,948
was the last person
to see Mr. Morley alive.

338
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:47,448
- This is the second occasion
this year

339
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:50,533
that my allowance has not been
paid on time, Alistair.

340
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:54,449
- You must talk to the bank,
Julia, or to the trustees.

341
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:58,784
- If only my poor dear sister
were still alive.

342
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,034
- If she were alive, Mother,

343
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,742
you couldn't benefit
from her will.

344
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:03,909
- That is a wicked thing to say,
Jane.

345
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:06,035
- It's not wicked; it's true.

346
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:09,285
- The truth is often wicked.

347
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:12,535
- I'm sorry, Julie;
this is not my business.

348
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,494
When I die, the capital
will come to you,

349
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,286
to do with exactly as you wish.

350
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,911
Until then--

351
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:22,787
- Until then, I am expected
to exist--I won't say "live"--

352
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,703
on the pittance from the trust.

353
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:31,163
- $25,000 a year can scarcely
be called a pittance.

354
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:44,944
- Do you think Rebecca intended
me to live on your charity?

355
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,027
- It is not charity.

356
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:51,195
Yes, Miss Montressor.

357
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,070
- A Chief Inspector Japp and
a Mr Poirot to see you, sir.

358
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,862
- Really?
Would you show them in, please?

359
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,363
Chief Inspector Japp.

360
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,613
- How do you do, sir?

361
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:05,821
This is Mr Hercule Poirot.

362
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:08,364
- I know your name, of course,
Monsieur Poirot,

363
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,722
but surely somewhere
quite recently--

364
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,097
- This morning, Monsieur Blunt.

365
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:15,698
In the waiting room of the dentist,
the pauvre Monsieur Morley.

366
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:18,015
- Yes, of course.
I knew I'd seen you somewhere.

367
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:23,241
- "Pauvre"?
- Mr. Morley was found dead, sir,
shortly after you left,

368
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,282
an apparent suicide.

369
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,265
- Morley?

370
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,933
Suicide?

371
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,808
- What an extraordinary thing.

372
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,808
- Uh...

373
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:33,933
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

374
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,684
This is my niece, Miss Olivera,
and her mother, Mrs Olivera.

375
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,284
- Mademoiselle, madame.

376
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,809
- I've never heard of a dentist
committing suicide before.

377
00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:45,693
Wouldn't happen in the States;
you can be sure of that.

378
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:48,693
They're too damn rich
to kill themselves.

379
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:52,153
- He seemed in good health and
spirits this morning, Mr Blunt?

380
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,944
- Well, I think so, yes.

381
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,694
- Have you seen him often?

382
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,736
- This is my third
or fourth visit.

383
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,112
- Monsieur Blunt, who was it

384
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:01,195
that recommended to you
Monsieur Morley originally?

385
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:04,320
- Arnholt, one of my directors.
Lionel Arnholt.

386
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:08,196
- We're just wondering, you see, sir,
whether it wasn't suicide but murder

387
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:10,696
and the real target
was yourself.

388
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,163
- But that doesn't make
any sense at all.

389
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:15,164
- Well, none of it does
at the moment, sir.

390
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,164
That's the problem.

391
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,467
- Good evening.

392
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,967
- We'd like to see
Mr Amberiotis.

393
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:54,760
- I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you can't.

394
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,302
- Oh, yes, I can, my lad.
Police.

395
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,803
- You don't understand, sir.

396
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,053
Mr. Amberiotis died
half an hour ago.

397
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:51,130
- Interesting.
- Interesting, Dr Bennett?

398
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:55,340
- Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure.

399
00:31:55,466 --> 00:31:57,631
- Heart failure?

400
00:31:57,757 --> 00:32:01,799
- Brought about by an overdose
of adrenaline and novocaine.

401
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,174
- How large an overdose?

402
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,591
- Oh, I can't say yet.

403
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,049
These quantitative analyses
take time.

404
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,550
I'll be able to tell you
tomorrow.

405
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,800
- Novocaine's the stuff
dentists give you, isn't it?

406
00:32:10,926 --> 00:32:12,217
- That's right, Chief Inspector.

407
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:15,926
The subject had been
to the dentist, I believe.

408
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:21,426
- What a washout.

409
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:22,927
- What do you mean,
Chief Inspector?

410
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,718
- Morley makes a mistake
and injects an overdose.

411
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,377
Then when Amberiotis is gone,
he realizes what he's done,

412
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,278
can't face the music,
and shoots himself.

413
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,969
- With a pistol
he is not known to possess?

414
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:34,761
- Relations don't know
everything.

415
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,469
- No, that is true, of course.

416
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:39,345
- Well, there we are, then.

417
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:43,262
- All the same, Chief Inspector,
it does not quite satisfy me.

418
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:45,054
- Ah, cheer up, Poirot.

419
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:48,430
We can't have
a nice juicy murder every time.

420
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,593
- Committed suicide?
Mr. Morley?

421
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,386
Poor man.

422
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:58,677
I suppose he had something
on his mind.

423
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:01,262
Such worrying times we live in.

424
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:04,470
- Did he seem worried to you,
Miss Sainsbury Seale?

425
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:10,221
- Well, I--I can't really say,
you know, that he did.

426
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,846
- Can you tell us who else
was in the waiting room

427
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:14,096
while you were there?

428
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:16,222
- Let me see.

429
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:19,180
There was just one young man
there when I went in.

430
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,514
I think he was in pain,

431
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,264
because he was muttering
to himself

432
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,098
and looking quite wild.

433
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,015
And then suddenly he jumped up
and went out.

434
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,640
- And he was the only other
patient that you noticed?

435
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:33,891
- A gentleman came
down the stairs and went out

436
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:36,099
just as I went up to Mr. Morley.

437
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,725
Oh, and I remember
a very peculiar foreigner

438
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,883
came out of the house
just as I arrived.

439
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,422
- That was I, madame.

440
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:48,673
- Oh.

441
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,798
Oh, dear.

442
00:33:50,924 --> 00:33:52,340
Oh, do forgive me.

443
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,924
Oh.
Oh.

444
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,757
The light in here is so dim.

445
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,966
- Please calm yourself, madame.

446
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:00,549
- Well, I think
that's about all,

447
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,092
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

448
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:03,592
We may require you
to give evidence

449
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:05,133
at the inquest, of course.

450
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:06,592
- Oh, no!

451
00:34:06,718 --> 00:34:08,426
I would be so nervous.

452
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:13,301
- Well, no need to be nervous, madam.
Just stand up and speak clearly.

453
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,635
- Oh! That's very
amusing, Chief Inspector.

454
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:18,877
- Is it?
- I used to be an actress.

455
00:34:19,197 --> 00:34:21,279
Just small parts, you know.

456
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,739
Then I went on a world tour--

457
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:26,447
- Yes, well...

458
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,406
- Well, if my name should be
in the papers--

459
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:33,573
as a witness at the inquest,
I mean--

460
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,573
you will be sure that it's
spelled right, won't you?

461
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,199
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.

462
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:44,532
Mabelle spelled M-a-b-e-I-I-e.

463
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:51,039
- Blimey.

464
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,207
- I can only give you
a few moments,

465
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,623
I'm afraid, Mr. Poirot.

466
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:03,249
I'm going to see Traviata
at Covent Garden.

467
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,666
- Ah.
Thank you, Monsieur Arnholt.

468
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:13,667
- What's this all about?

469
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:17,918
- It is about the death of the
dentist Monsieur Henry Morley.

470
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:19,376
It was you, was it not,

471
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:21,043
who recommended him
to Monsieur Blunt?

472
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:24,252
- Yes, I've been going to him
for years.

473
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:25,769
You don't think I killed him,
do you?

474
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:29,244
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Quelle idée. No.

475
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,279
It is just that I'm given
to wonder

476
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:34,697
whether Monsieur Blunt was not
perhaps the intended victim.

477
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:37,197
- I don't quite see
how that works.

478
00:35:37,323 --> 00:35:38,363
- No.

479
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,298
At this moment,
Monsieur Arnholt, neither do I.

480
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,091
One grips at the straws.

481
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:46,132
But tell me, Madame Olivera,

482
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,008
the sister-in-law
to Monsieur Blunt,

483
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,433
she is une dame formidable,
n'est-ce pas?

484
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:52,467
- Oh, indeed.

485
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:53,967
- How did Madame Olivera take

486
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,534
to Monsieur Blunt marrying
her sister?

487
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,968
I mean, after all,

488
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:00,843
he was a mere employee
of the family business.

489
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,385
- I don't know about "mere."

490
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:05,635
Alistair was head of our
overseas investments department.

491
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:08,688
- But I don't think Aunt Julia
looked at it like that anyway.

492
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:12,647
They were so obviously
crazy about each other.

493
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:15,439
Nobody, of course, knew,
but she was already suffering

494
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:18,106
from the disease that killed her
four years later.

495
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:20,648
- A tragedy.

496
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:22,690
- Yes.

497
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,830
- Pardon.

498
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:30,580
I must detain you no longer
from your Monsieur Verdi.

499
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:34,123
Monsieur Arnholt, I thank you
very much for your patience,

500
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:37,081
and I hope that you enjoy
the opera.

501
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,331
- Thank you.

502
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,816
- I formed the opinion

503
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,775
that Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure

504
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,609
caused by a large overdose

505
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,784
of a novocaine and adrenaline
mixture.

506
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,718
- The dentist who treated
Mr Amberiotis earlier

507
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,343
on the day of his death

508
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:32,344
is now himself dead,
I understand.

509
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,177
- So I understand, sir.

510
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,552
- Thank you, Dr Bennett.

511
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:39,887
- Thank you.

512
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:43,195
- Well, there doesn't seem
much doubt, gentlemen,

513
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:45,553
that this is a case
of accidental death,

514
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,788
a very unfortunate case.

515
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:52,004
Did Mr Morley
accidentally give his patient

516
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:56,085
too large a dose
of the anesthetic?

517
00:37:56,253 --> 00:38:01,877
Or did Mr Amberiotis have
an unusual reaction to it?

518
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:06,461
Since Mr Morley
is now himself dead,

519
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:10,921
we shall never have the answer
to this.

520
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,921
Nevertheless, it is your duty,
of course,

521
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:18,880
gentlemen of the jury,
to consider all possibilities

522
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,713
before you arrive
at your verdict.

523
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,797
But I must remind you
that before...

524
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:37,215
- Nobody's seen hide nor hair
of Miss Sainsbury Seale

525
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,965
since Tuesday.

526
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:43,216
Such a nice type of woman,
and she seemed so happy here.

527
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:45,133
- I wouldn't have bothered you
with this, sir,

528
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,424
but I remember she'd been
a witness in that other case.

529
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,967
- No, quite right, Beddoes.

530
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:56,218
Why should she disappear?

531
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:02,760
- It is curious, you admit?

532
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:05,552
- There was nothing funny
about her, you know?

533
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,344
A cable to Calcutta.

534
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,719
Got the reply back last night.

535
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:13,762
She went out there as an actress
and then took to good works.

536
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:17,178
Got hand in glove with
the missionaries, apparently.

537
00:39:17,346 --> 00:39:19,429
What I call a terrible woman

538
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:23,396
but definitely not the type
to get mixed up in a murder.

539
00:39:24,222 --> 00:39:26,722
You got anything?

540
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,097
- Stockings.

541
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:31,430
Ten-inch, cheap silk.

542
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:34,873
Price: probably 2 shillings
and 11 pence.

543
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:38,242
- You're not valuing
for probate, Poirot.

544
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:53,502
- Mr Poirot.
- Mademoiselle Neville.

545
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,543
What a pleasant surprise.

546
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:57,461
- I'm so sorry to worry you
like this,

547
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,253
but I had to see you.

548
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:02,711
I was very upset by the inquest
this morning.

549
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,379
It couldn't happen
the way they said it did--

550
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:08,295
giving a patient an overdose,
I mean.

551
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,837
The dentists get into the habit

552
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:12,463
of giving the regulation amount
automatically.

553
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,796
- But you did not say this
in the coroner's court.

554
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,238
- I was afraid
of making things worse.

555
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:19,224
People might think
he did it deliberately.

556
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,941
- I see.

557
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:23,247
Shall we discuss this further?

558
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:25,497
Come.

559
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,040
I should like to know
a little bit more

560
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:41,708
about the telegram you received
calling you away on that day.

561
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,333
Do you yourself have any ideas
on the subject?

562
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:46,019
- Not really.

563
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,806
Frank, my friend,

564
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:53,806
accused me of wanting to go off
for the day with somebody else.

565
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:58,391
- He's been very moody
and suspicious lately.

566
00:40:58,517 --> 00:40:59,849
Just losing his job

567
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:01,849
and not being able
to get another one, I suppose.

568
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:03,641
- And he was upset, was he not,
to discover

569
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,017
that you had gone away
on that day?

570
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:07,517
- Yes. You see, he'd
come round to tell me

571
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:10,642
how he'd got this marvelous
new job, £10 a week.

572
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,059
- He wanted me to know
right away.

573
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:16,893
- And what is it,
this new job?

574
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,127
- Oh, well, I don't know
all the details.

575
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,127
Some government department.

576
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:24,586
I have to write
to his London address,

577
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:25,919
and the letters get forwarded.

578
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:27,212
- Oh, la.

579
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:30,337
Does that not seem to you
to be a little strange?

580
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:31,878
- Well, I thought so,

581
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,838
but Frank says
it's often done nowadays.

582
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:40,606
- I should like to meet this
friend of yours, mademoiselle.

583
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,357
- His only free day is Sunday.

584
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,315
He's away in the country
all week.

585
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:47,482
- Eh bien, tomorrow is Sunday.

586
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,894
- I'm fed up with 'earing
about Morley's death,

587
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,352
to be quite honest.

588
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,394
There wasn't anything
so wonderful about him

589
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,311
that I could see.

590
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:06,628
- Tell me, Monsieur Carter,

591
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:09,645
why were you in Harley Street
that day?

592
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:13,534
I saw you there
in the waiting room.

593
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:17,651
- All right.

594
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:19,026
I was gonna tell Morley

595
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:21,236
that this business
of putting Gladys against me

596
00:42:21,362 --> 00:42:23,986
had gone on long enough,
that I'd landed a good job,

597
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,111
and that it was about time
she handed in her notice

598
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:27,570
a thought about a trousseau.

599
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:30,320
- But you did not actually
tell him these things?

600
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:33,320
- I got fed up with waiting
in that dingy mausoleum,

601
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:34,696
so I left.

602
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:36,446
- At what time did you leave?

603
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:38,363
- I can't remember.

604
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:44,447
I've got to get going;
the march will be starting soon.

605
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:47,947
- It has been a great pleasure
to meet you, Monsieur Carter.

606
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:53,671
And, yes, I am delighted
to hear about your new job.

607
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:57,254
The work, it is interesting,
n'est-ce pas?

608
00:42:57,381 --> 00:42:59,172
- Oh, yeah.

609
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:01,005
You know.

610
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:03,922
I'll see you next week, Gladys.

611
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:04,965
- Bye, Frank.

612
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,923
- Au revoir, Monsieur Carter.

613
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:32,557
Are you receiving visitors,
mon ami?

614
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:34,307
- Good heavens.
Poirot.

615
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:35,516
- Chief Inspector.

616
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,100
- What on Earth brings you
to Isleworth

617
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,266
on a Sunday afternoon?

618
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:39,891
- Business.
What else?

619
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,266
- Well, you better come inside
and have a cup of tea.

620
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:44,559
- Thank you.

621
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:52,176
- Madame Japp,
she is not at home?

622
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,592
- No, no.

623
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:55,676
Some blessed meeting.

624
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:59,010
Women's institute,
parish counsel, or something.

625
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,343
I don't know.

626
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:04,177
Do you take sugar, Poirot?

627
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:06,094
- Do you have perhaps a tisane?

628
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,386
- Come off it, Poirot.

629
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:10,886
This is Isleworth, you know,
not Juan-les-Pins.

630
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,175
What's the business, anyway?

631
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:18,758
- I wondered if you'd been able
to trace the telegram

632
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:21,342
that was sent
to Mademoiselle Gladys Neville.

633
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,467
- Yes, we did,
as a matter of fact.

634
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:26,342
Rather clever.

635
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:29,385
The aunt lives in Richmond
in Yorkshire.

636
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:32,052
The telegram was handed in
in Richmond, Surrey,

637
00:44:32,178 --> 00:44:34,052
just down the road here.

638
00:44:34,178 --> 00:44:36,011
- Do you know what I think,
Chief Inspector?

639
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,761
- What's that?

640
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,220
- I think that there are signs
of brains in this business.

641
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:50,470
- Well, the assistant commissioner is
satisfied that Morley killed himself.

642
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,646
- Is he satisfied
with the disappearing lady?

643
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:55,071
- Ah, the case
of the disappearing Seale.

644
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:58,978
No. I'm still working on that.

645
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,394
She's got to be somewhere.

646
00:45:02,562 --> 00:45:05,478
Mm.
Garibaldi?

647
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:13,355
- And I really think my feelings
ought to be considered

648
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,855
in the matter, Alistair.

649
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:16,938
- But your feelings
have been considered, Mother.

650
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,396
- Yes, Julia, that is true.

651
00:45:20,857 --> 00:45:22,647
- Mr. Poirot to see you,
Mr. Blunt.

652
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:24,106
- Thank you, Helen.

653
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:26,147
Monsieur Poirot,
it's very good of you to come.

654
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,231
- Monsieur Blunt.

655
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,457
- Well!

656
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:33,124
If you are going to talk
horrors, I shall leave.

657
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,083
- Allow me.

658
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,792
- I'll see you at home, Jane.

659
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:41,750
- Madame.

660
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:44,918
- You've met Miss Olivera,
I think.

661
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,709
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Mademoiselle.

662
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,459
- Please.
- Thank you.

663
00:45:48,585 --> 00:45:50,209
- I hope
I haven't asked you here

664
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:52,627
on a wild goose chase,
Mr. Poirot.

665
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:55,544
It's about this missing woman
that the papers are full of,

666
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,002
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

667
00:45:57,128 --> 00:45:58,878
- Yes.
- Jane?

668
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:01,420
I'm sure
this is utterly unimportant.

669
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:03,711
And why we are wasting
Mr. Poirot's time,

670
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:04,795
I really don't know.

671
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,921
- If you please, Mr. Blunt,
allow Poirot to decide.

672
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,754
- Well, Sainsbury Seale
is such a pompous name.

673
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,462
That's why I remembered.

674
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:13,587
It was the last time

675
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:15,463
Uncle Alistair went
to the dentist.

676
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:17,480
Well, I don't mean the other
day; I mean about a week ago.

677
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,914
I was with him,
and we stopped in Harley Street,

678
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,456
and just as he got out,
a woman came out of the dentist,

679
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:26,248
a middle-aged woman
with fussy hair

680
00:46:26,374 --> 00:46:28,623
and rather dowdy clothes.

681
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:32,874
"Oh, Mr. Blunt, you don't
remember me, I'm sure."

682
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,291
- People are always saying that,

683
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,791
and I never do.

684
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:38,000
- "I was a great friend
of your wife's, you know."

685
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:40,067
- They usually say that too.
It always ends the same way:

686
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:42,228
a subscription
to some charity or other.

687
00:46:42,354 --> 00:46:44,812
£5 to a Zenana mission
this time.

688
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:47,437
- And had she really known
your wife, Monsieur Blunt?

689
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:49,437
- Well...

690
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:52,730
the mention of the Zenana mission
made me think she may have done.

691
00:46:52,856 --> 00:46:56,563
We were in India about four years
ago, just before my wife's death.

692
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,513
Perhaps we met once
at a reception.

693
00:46:58,557 --> 00:46:59,932
- I think it's queer

694
00:47:00,058 --> 00:47:02,482
the way she tried to scrape
an acquaintance with you.

695
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:07,338
- And she did not try to, um,
how do you say,

696
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:08,797
follow it up in any way?

697
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,934
- Why, no.

698
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,476
I'd forgotten her name, even,

699
00:47:11,602 --> 00:47:13,159
until Jane spotted it
in the paper.

700
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:18,019
- Well, I just thought
you ought to be told,

701
00:47:18,145 --> 00:47:20,827
Monsieur Poirot.

702
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,048
- Here.

703
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:27,673
Here, Alison?

704
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:29,173
- What?

705
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:32,258
- There's a thing here
about a woman who came here,

706
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,758
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

707
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,759
It says here she's missing.

708
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,009
- You don't have a passkey?

709
00:47:42,135 --> 00:47:44,217
- No, I've never had one.

710
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:45,968
- We can't just break in.

711
00:47:46,094 --> 00:47:47,968
- Well, suppose
something's happened to her.

712
00:47:48,094 --> 00:47:50,093
- Yes, and suppose
she's gone off on holidays.

713
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:52,161
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.

714
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:55,069
- Go on, Sergeant.

715
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:57,948
Right.

716
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:16,576
- Mrs. Chapman!

717
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:18,659
- Leave it to us.

718
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:21,867
Mrs. Chapman!

719
00:48:24,578 --> 00:48:26,443
- Sergeant.

720
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,369
Hello?

721
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,687
Anybody there?

722
00:48:43,827 --> 00:48:46,119
Mrs. Chapman?

723
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,495
Hello?

724
00:48:58,957 --> 00:49:01,373
Anybody here?

725
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,041
- This is the boxroom.

726
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:18,375
- What's that?

727
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:20,334
- Well, I don't know.

728
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,918
- Shall I open it, Sarge?

729
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:29,626
- Go on, then.

730
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,910
It's not particularly pleasant.

731
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:29,411
- That's the porter
being sick, sir.

732
00:50:29,537 --> 00:50:31,871
I had to get him to have
another look at the body

733
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:34,079
to identify it.

734
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:54,950
- There's some brandy
in the other room.

735
00:51:10,578 --> 00:51:12,744
- It was not pretty, that.

736
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,191
Tell me all about it,
Chief Inspector.

737
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:26,567
- The flat belongs
to a Mrs Albert Chapman.

738
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:28,692
Can't tell you much about her,
really.

739
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:30,233
Pays her bills.

740
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,068
Fond of a game of bridge.

741
00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:34,401
Keeps herself to herself
more or less.

742
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:39,777
The neighbors say they've hardly
ever seen her, in fact.

743
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,569
Mr Chapman's a commercial
traveller, apparently,

744
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:45,835
so he spends most of his time
away from home.

745
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:48,630
- And Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale?

746
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:52,047
- She came here on the evening
of our interview with her,

747
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:54,256
about 7:15.

748
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:56,298
The porter's wife
was cleaning up here

749
00:51:56,424 --> 00:51:57,673
and saw her arrive.

750
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,181
She'd been here once before,
the porter says.

751
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:02,797
Now, one thing's for certain:

752
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:06,005
Sylvia Chapman
or Sylvia's friends

753
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:08,713
murdered the lady, put her
in the box, and made off.

754
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:11,339
- But why was the face
so battered?

755
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:13,256
- Sheer vindictiveness, maybe.

756
00:52:13,424 --> 00:52:14,839
Or it may have been
with the idea

757
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,715
of concealing
the woman's identity.

758
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,424
I don't know.

759
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:23,294
No fingerprints anywhere,
as far as we can see.

760
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,712
- You mean every fingerprint
in the apartment

761
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,462
was removed after the murder?

762
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:29,545
- That's about the size of it.

763
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:11,266
Something worrying you, Poirot?

764
00:53:14,075 --> 00:53:15,658
Yes.

765
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:21,092
Yes, I'm very seriously worried.

766
00:53:37,488 --> 00:53:41,655
There is here, you see,
an insoluble problem.

767
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:47,281
- One patent leather shoe,
complete with buckle.

768
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:48,364
What's wrong with that?

769
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,656
- Nothing.

770
00:53:50,782 --> 00:53:53,323
Absolutely nothing.

771
00:53:56,075 --> 00:54:00,782
All the same,
I do not understand.

772
00:54:07,326 --> 00:54:10,992
Some bearers
belonging to Madame Chapman.

773
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:13,992
Ah.

774
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:17,335
Some old theater programs.

775
00:54:23,587 --> 00:54:25,587
A leaflet
about the Zenana missions.

776
00:54:25,754 --> 00:54:28,212
- We can guess
who brought that here.

777
00:54:31,046 --> 00:54:33,921
- Nothing much of interest
in the address book either, sir.

778
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:36,796
- No, so I see.

779
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:38,588
Hairdressers.

780
00:54:38,714 --> 00:54:41,589
Dressmakers.

781
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,005
A dentist.

782
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:46,464
Morley, 168 Harley Street.

783
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,965
- Not so strange

784
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:50,631
if she was a friend
of the Sainsbury Seale woman.

785
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:16,992
- Mr. Poirot?

786
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:18,868
What brings you here?

787
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,243
- Tell me, if you please,

788
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:24,910
did your brother ever mention
to you in particular

789
00:55:25,036 --> 00:55:28,161
a Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
or a Madame Chapman?

790
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:30,036
- No.

791
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:31,952
No, I don't think so.

792
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,120
- I managed to make this

793
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,912
before they took everything,
Miss Morley.

794
00:55:35,038 --> 00:55:36,287
- Oh, thank you, Agnes.

795
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,453
Would you like a cup, sir?

796
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:42,046
- Not for me, Agnes.
Thank you very much.

797
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:44,863
- Agnes is coming with me
to the country.

798
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:46,946
She's becoming
quite a good little cook,

799
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,693
so she'll be able
to do everything for me.

800
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,016
- Excuse me, sir...
- Yes.

801
00:56:04,183 --> 00:56:06,257
- For asking.
- Yes.

802
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:08,016
- But does anyone know
anything more

803
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:09,807
about the master's death, sir?

804
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,392
- Nothing fresh
has come to light, Agnes.

805
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:14,142
- They're still quite sure
he shot himself

806
00:56:14,268 --> 00:56:16,183
because he'd made a mistake
with that drug.

807
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,393
- Yes.

808
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:19,476
Why do you ask?

809
00:56:19,602 --> 00:56:21,476
- I only--
- Agnes?

810
00:56:21,602 --> 00:56:23,726
- I just want to be sure, sir.

811
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:26,227
- Agnes!

812
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,983
- Ah, Chief Inspector.
- No time, Poirot.

813
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:52,525
We found
Mr and Mrs Albert Chapman.

814
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:53,858
- Where?

815
00:56:53,984 --> 00:56:55,983
- They booked into the
Montague Hotel this morning.

816
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,442
- The Montague Hotel, Bloomsbury?

817
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:58,526
- That's right.

818
00:56:58,652 --> 00:56:59,984
- It is odd, is it not,

819
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,692
being on the run after murdering
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,

820
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:04,443
that they have not run further?

821
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:07,318
- You never can tell
with the criminal mind, Poirot.

822
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,780
- Open up!

823
00:57:16,306 --> 00:57:17,305
- Who is it?

824
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:19,098
- Police.

825
00:57:19,266 --> 00:57:20,515
- Police?

826
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:23,723
- Just open the door,
Mr Chapman.

827
00:57:26,266 --> 00:57:27,641
- Here!

828
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,891
- All right, there's no need
for anyone to get hurt.

829
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,599
You are Mr Albert Chapman?

830
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:33,766
- Yes.

831
00:57:33,893 --> 00:57:36,850
- And this is Mrs Chapman?

832
00:57:36,976 --> 00:57:39,500
- Yes. What's the
meaning of this?

833
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:41,093
- I'll ask the questions, sir.

834
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:43,053
Do you live
at number 45 Lichfield Court

835
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:44,303
in Battersea in the--

836
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:45,636
- No.

837
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,094
- What do you mean, "no"?

838
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,553
- Well, we don't.

839
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,429
Do we, Beryl?

840
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:52,762
- Beryl?

841
00:57:52,888 --> 00:57:55,179
- What's wrong with "Beryl"?

842
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,338
We happen to know that your name
is Sylvia, Mrs Chapman.

843
00:57:58,357 --> 00:57:59,981
- What are you talking about?

844
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:02,106
- We live in Budleigh Salterton,

845
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:05,274
not this...Lichfield place.

846
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,357
- You have proof of that,
I suppose.

847
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:08,982
- Well, no, I haven't--

848
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,232
Yes, I have.

849
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,733
- Watch him, Beddoes.

850
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:21,776
What's this?

851
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:24,401
- Our wedding lines,
if you must know.

852
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:28,860
- We were married this morning.

853
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:40,989
- I swear by almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

854
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,790
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

855
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,890
and nothing but the truth.

856
00:59:48,163 --> 00:59:51,080
- You are Mr John Leatheran?

857
00:59:51,206 --> 00:59:52,163
- Yes, sir.

858
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,872
- And you are a dentist.

859
00:59:53,998 --> 00:59:55,497
- Yes, sir.

860
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:57,038
I've taken over
the dental practice

861
00:59:57,164 --> 00:59:59,873
of the late Mr. Henry Morley
at 168 Harley Street.

862
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:01,464
- I see.

863
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,914
You were recently called

864
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,024
to examine the body
of the deceased

865
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,452
for purposes of identification.

866
01:00:09,322 --> 01:00:10,279
Were you not?

867
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:11,987
- I was, sir.

868
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:13,363
The police believed the body

869
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:15,822
to be that of
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale,

870
01:00:15,948 --> 01:00:17,322
who was a patient
of Mr Morley's.

871
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:18,947
- I see.

872
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:23,531
You've inherited, as it were,
the late Mr Morley's patients.

873
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:24,698
- That's right, sir.

874
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:26,323
- And, of course,
their dental records.

875
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,656
- Quite.

876
01:00:27,783 --> 01:00:31,365
- And could you identify
the body from these records?

877
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:32,782
- I could, sir.

878
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:35,032
It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.

879
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:39,450
It was Mrs Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr Morley's.

880
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:53,185
- The fair Mabelle
put one over on us

881
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:54,560
good and proper.

882
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:57,019
I wouldn't have thought
she was capable of murder,

883
01:00:57,145 --> 01:00:58,561
but that's what it looks like
now.

884
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:02,561
Sylvia didn't murder Mabelle;
Mabelle murdered Sylvia.

885
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:04,311
- Perhaps.

886
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:07,396
- It crossed my mind that Morley
might have been killed

887
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:09,396
so he couldn't identify
the body.

888
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:11,354
- But, as you have just heard,
Chief Inspector,

889
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,022
the records
would still have existed.

890
01:01:13,148 --> 01:01:15,063
- That's right.

891
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:17,230
Anyway, I'm going back to work.

892
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:18,730
- Oh, Chief Inspector.

893
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:21,814
This morning, I received
a letter from Monsieur Blunt.

894
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,106
He has invited me to his house
in the country.

895
01:01:24,232 --> 01:01:26,189
He may have a commission for me.

896
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,190
- Well, you always did move
in exalted circles, Poirot.

897
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,218
- Helen isn't dining with us
tonight?

898
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:49,218
- I suggested that it would be
far better for her to rest

899
01:01:49,386 --> 01:01:51,844
than to go to all the bother
of dressing herself up

900
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,219
and coming down.

901
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:56,303
She saw my point.

902
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,886
- Oh?

903
01:01:58,012 --> 01:02:00,012
I thought it might make
a pleasant change for her.

904
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:03,970
- I really don't see why
you need a secretary

905
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,263
during the weekend anyway.

906
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:09,555
- She's new to the job.

907
01:02:09,722 --> 01:02:12,138
There's a lot
she needs to learn.

908
01:02:21,552 --> 01:02:23,176
Monsieur Poirot?

909
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:27,131
There is a great deal
about which

910
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:29,573
I am not entirely satisfied.

911
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,379
- What do you want of me,
Monsieur Blunt?

912
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:37,421
- I want you to find this woman
Sainsbury Seale.

913
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,838
- Alive or dead?

914
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:43,005
- You think she may be dead.

915
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,712
- I think...

916
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,795
She might be dead, yes.

917
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:56,212
- Why do you think so?

918
01:02:56,993 --> 01:03:01,160
- Because of a pair of new
silk stockings I discovered.

919
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:07,411
You're an odd man,
Monsieur Poirot.

920
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:08,953
- Oh, yes, I am.

921
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:11,286
Very odd.

922
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:16,912
That is to say, I am methodical,
orderly, and logical,

923
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,579
and I do not like
to distort facts

924
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,788
to support a theory.

925
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:57,946
Good morning.

926
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:33,826
- Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.

927
01:04:33,952 --> 01:04:35,076
Did you sleep well?

928
01:04:35,202 --> 01:04:37,618
- Excellently.
Thank you, Monsieur Blunt.

929
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:38,952
Good morning, mademoiselle.

930
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:41,118
- Good morning, Mr Poirot.

931
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:45,059
I would prefer not to accept
any invitations, Mr Blunt,

932
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:48,184
while your American relations
are with you.

933
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:56,352
- Good morning.

934
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:58,352
Julia.

935
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,353
I'm afraid you rather hurt
Helen's feelings.

936
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,645
- Oh, for heaven's sake,
Alistair.

937
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:05,395
She's only a secretary.

938
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,771
- I notice
that you have a gardener

939
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:16,063
who you must have employed
recently.

940
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:19,982
- Yes, we took one on
a couple of weeks ago.

941
01:05:20,108 --> 01:05:22,733
- Do you know
from where he came?

942
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:24,525
- I'm afraid not.

943
01:05:24,651 --> 01:05:26,775
MacAlister, the head gardener,
engaged him.

944
01:05:26,901 --> 01:05:29,025
- Oh.
What is his name?

945
01:05:29,151 --> 01:05:30,276
- Well, I don't know.

946
01:05:30,402 --> 01:05:33,276
Dunning, Sunbury,
something of the sort.

947
01:05:37,415 --> 01:05:40,582
- Seems like lots of people are out
for your blood, Uncle Alistair.

948
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:44,123
- Oh, really?
What are you reading?

949
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:45,916
Oh, the debate in the House.

950
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,499
That's only Archerton.

951
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,041
If we'd let him have his way,

952
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,999
England would be bankrupt
within a week.

953
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,625
- Did you know there are
over 2 million unemployed

954
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:55,167
in this country?

955
01:05:55,293 --> 01:05:58,667
- One can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs, Jane.

956
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:01,543
- I think we do pretty well,
all things considered.

957
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:04,043
Industrial production
was up 3% last year.

958
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:07,919
- Take no notice
of what Jane says.

959
01:06:08,045 --> 01:06:10,044
You know what girls are.

960
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:13,086
They go to these parties
in studios,

961
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:15,712
and then they come home
and talk a lot of nonsense.

962
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,295
- Mother.

963
01:06:17,421 --> 01:06:20,420
- I'm afraid I'm one of the last
of the old guard,

964
01:06:20,546 --> 01:06:21,795
Monsieur Poirot.

965
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:25,641
- And if the old guard should
be removed, what would happen?

966
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,272
- Removed? I'll tell you.

967
01:06:30,398 --> 01:06:31,481
A lot of damn fools

968
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:33,648
would try a lot
of very costly experiments.

969
01:06:33,774 --> 01:06:35,815
It would be the end
of stability,

970
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,648
of common sense,
and of solvency.

971
01:06:38,358 --> 01:06:40,107
- Ah.

972
01:06:49,794 --> 01:06:53,502
Of course, we've always taken great
pride in our herbaceous borders here.

973
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,919
They're a lot of work, mind,

974
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,877
but well worth the effort,
I've always thought.

975
01:06:57,003 --> 01:06:59,002
- Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.

976
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:01,420
- Yes, they're particularly good
this year.

977
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:02,586
And look at these here.

978
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:06,045
Good god!

979
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:08,766
- Drop that gun!
- It wasn't me, I tell you.

980
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:10,974
- Oh, no? Just shooting
at the birds, I suppose.

981
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,891
Oh, Mr. Blunt!

982
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:15,182
I caught him right at it.

983
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:17,258
- I was just weeding the beds.

984
01:07:17,684 --> 01:07:19,600
I heard a shot,
the gun fell right at my feet,

985
01:07:19,726 --> 01:07:21,658
I picked it up, and this
stupid cow jumped on me.

986
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:23,377
- Now, then, Dunning, Dunbury--

987
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:24,461
what is your name?

988
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:26,544
- His name is Frank Carter.

989
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:29,094
- You. You've had it
in for me all along.

990
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:30,927
I never fired that shot!

991
01:07:31,053 --> 01:07:32,969
- In that case, who did?

992
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:36,302
As you can see,
there is no one else here

993
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:38,970
but ourselves.

994
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:10,432
You really must not agitate
yourself, Mademoiselle Neville.

995
01:08:10,558 --> 01:08:12,182
- First they tried to pretend

996
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:15,182
that Frank attempted
to murder Mr. Blunt,

997
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:19,725
and now they've accused him
of murdering poor Mr Morley.

998
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:21,016
- Sugar?

999
01:08:21,142 --> 01:08:23,475
- No, thank you.

1000
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:26,726
- I was down there, you know,
at Exsham,

1001
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,767
when the shot was fired
at Monsieur Blunt.

1002
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:31,393
- It's these Blackshirts.

1003
01:08:31,519 --> 01:08:33,852
They march around
waving their banners.

1004
01:08:33,978 --> 01:08:35,810
They have
this ridiculous salute.

1005
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:39,519
And they work up these poor men
like Frank until they think

1006
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:42,228
they're doing something
wonderful and patriotic.

1007
01:08:42,354 --> 01:08:44,478
- And that is the defense
of Monsieur Carter?

1008
01:08:44,645 --> 01:08:46,394
- No! I haven't seen him,
of course.

1009
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:47,437
They wouldn't let me.

1010
01:08:47,563 --> 01:08:49,854
- Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

1011
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:02,269
- He has a solicitor
working for him,

1012
01:09:02,395 --> 01:09:04,727
and he told me
what Frank had said.

1013
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:09,187
He met a man in a public house

1014
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,020
who said
he was in the secret service,

1015
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:16,938
and he offered Frank
this wonderful job.

1016
01:09:17,064 --> 01:09:20,563
He was to take up the post
of gardener

1017
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,397
and listen to all the other
gardeners' conversations

1018
01:09:24,523 --> 01:09:28,647
and sound them out
as to their Red tendencies.

1019
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:31,147
He had to pretend to be
a bit of a Red himself.

1020
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:33,965
- And this solicitor,
he is of the opinion

1021
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:35,464
that his client would do better

1022
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:37,672
to think of a story
that is more plausible?

1023
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,840
- Lawyers.

1024
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:44,256
You wouldn't believe
how difficult they are.

1025
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:48,704
- Mademoiselle Neville.

1026
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,621
What did you think
of the housemaid, Agnes?

1027
01:09:52,747 --> 01:09:56,122
- I didn't think at all
about her.

1028
01:09:56,248 --> 01:09:59,039
Mr Morley's sister
kept a strict eye on the maids.

1029
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:00,497
- Ah.

1030
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:02,748
- Why are you asking?

1031
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:05,956
- She wrote to me a letter,
and...

1032
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:08,965
As yet, I do not know why.

1033
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:27,314
Thank you.

1034
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:49,233
- Your tea, madam.

1035
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:51,650
- Thank you.

1036
01:10:51,776 --> 01:10:54,650
I hope you didn't mind me
writing you that letter, sir,

1037
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:57,734
only I didn't want for you
to come to the house.

1038
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:01,484
I mean, if I was to say anything
in front of Miss Morley,

1039
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:04,318
she might say as how I ought
to have said something before.

1040
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:07,652
Me and the cook,
we'd read in the papers

1041
01:11:07,778 --> 01:11:09,943
how the master had made
a mistake with that drug

1042
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,444
and had shot himself.

1043
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,861
So it did seem quite clear,
didn't it, sir?

1044
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:16,178
- When did you begin
to feel differently, Agnes?

1045
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:20,179
- Seeing in the paper, sir,
about that Frank Carter

1046
01:11:20,305 --> 01:11:23,137
shooting at that gentleman.

1047
01:11:23,263 --> 01:11:25,721
I mean, up till then,

1048
01:11:25,889 --> 01:11:29,138
neither of us thought he'd done
anything to Mr Morley.

1049
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,931
We just thought
it was a bit queer.

1050
01:11:33,057 --> 01:11:35,056
- What was queer, Agnes?

1051
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:40,056
- It was that morning, sir. The
morning Mr. Morley shot himself.

1052
01:11:40,182 --> 01:11:43,498
I was wondering if I dared
run down and get the post,

1053
01:11:43,524 --> 01:11:48,683
so I went out on the landing, and
I looked down over the stairs.

1054
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,994
And it was then that I saw him,

1055
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,119
Frank Carter,
down on the stairs below.

1056
01:11:54,245 --> 01:11:58,287
He was just standing there,
like, waiting.

1057
01:11:58,413 --> 01:12:00,162
Then he seemed
to make up his mind,

1058
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:02,537
and he sort of went
very quickly down the stairs

1059
01:12:02,663 --> 01:12:05,413
towards the master's surgery.

1060
01:12:05,539 --> 01:12:09,496
And I thought to myself,
"The master won't like that."

1061
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,465
- Agnes!

1062
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:13,590
- But just then, Cook called me,

1063
01:12:13,757 --> 01:12:15,548
and I went back
into the kitchen.

1064
01:12:15,716 --> 01:12:17,965
And afterwards, I heard
the master had shot himself,

1065
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:20,699
and it was so awful, it just
drove everything out of my head.

1066
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,727
- Tell me, Agnes.

1067
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:25,895
Did you actually see
Frank Carter

1068
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,520
enter the room
of Monsieur Morley?

1069
01:12:28,646 --> 01:12:30,853
- He must have done, sir.

1070
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,853
- At what time was this?

1071
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:36,063
- It must have been
about half past 12:00, sir.

1072
01:12:53,028 --> 01:12:54,944
- I want to see Frank Carter.

1073
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,995
- What's the big idea?

1074
01:12:57,134 --> 01:12:59,383
- You are unwilling?

1075
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:03,341
- What do you want
to see Carter for?

1076
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,342
Ask him
if he really murdered Morley?

1077
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:06,800
- Yes.

1078
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:09,009
- I suppose you think
he'll tell you if he did.

1079
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,675
- He might tell me, yes.

1080
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:12,826
- That can only mean that you've
got hold of something

1081
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:15,601
that proves more or less
conclusively that he didn't.

1082
01:13:15,605 --> 01:13:18,021
You ought to play fair
with us, Poirot.

1083
01:13:18,147 --> 01:13:22,272
- I am playing fair with you,
Chief Inspector.

1084
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,939
Believe me.

1085
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:43,214
- It's a damned lie!

1086
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,964
You paid her to say that.

1087
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,006
- Anger and abuse will not
help you, Monsieur Carter.

1088
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,382
Agnes is going to tell
her story,

1089
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:52,498
and it is going to be believed.

1090
01:13:52,592 --> 01:13:55,633
You were on the stairs,
Agnes did see you,

1091
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:58,384
and you did go into the room
of Monsieur Morley.

1092
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,634
What happened then?

1093
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,009
- It's a lie!

1094
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:09,321
- No.

1095
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:12,697
It is not a lie.

1096
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:17,572
If you did not kill
Monsieur Morley,

1097
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:21,364
your only hope is to tell me
the exact truth

1098
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,323
of what happened that morning.

1099
01:14:27,908 --> 01:14:32,282
- God curse you
if you let me down now.

1100
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:52,868
I did go in.

1101
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:57,126
I went up the stairs and waited
above Morley's landing

1102
01:14:57,252 --> 01:15:00,409
till I could be sure
of getting him alone.

1103
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:03,911
Then a bearded gent came out
and went down the stairs.

1104
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:07,296
I was just making up my mind
to go

1105
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:10,783
when another gent came out
and went down the stairs too.

1106
01:15:12,618 --> 01:15:15,575
I knew I had to be quick.

1107
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:18,284
I went along and nicked
into his room without knocking.

1108
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,993
I was all set
to have it out with him.

1109
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:23,285
But he was lying there dead,

1110
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:24,951
and I could see the bullet hole
in his head

1111
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,577
where a black crust
of blood ran.

1112
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,870
He was cold.

1113
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:42,204
I knew I was in a jam then.

1114
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,454
They were going to say
I'd done it.

1115
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:50,891
I hadn't touched anything

1116
01:15:51,017 --> 01:15:53,599
except his hand
and the doorknob.

1117
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,058
I wiped that
with my handkerchief,

1118
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,684
both sides,
as I went out.

1119
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,975
There was nobody in the hall,
and I let myself out

1120
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:02,934
and licked it
as fast as I could.

1121
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:06,492
That's the truth.
He was dead already.

1122
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:08,826
You've got to believe me.

1123
01:16:15,744 --> 01:16:18,943
- By telling me the truth,

1124
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:22,803
you have just saved yourself
from being hanged.

1125
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:25,608
- I don't see it.

1126
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:26,692
They're going to say--

1127
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:28,026
- Monsieur Carter.

1128
01:16:28,152 --> 01:16:31,151
Your story has confirmed
what I knew to be the truth.

1129
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:35,152
You can leave it now to me.

1130
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:03,089
- Japp.

1131
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:06,090
Ah, Poirot.

1132
01:17:06,216 --> 01:17:11,465
Yes?

1133
01:17:12,884 --> 01:17:15,258
What?

1134
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:16,966
No, Poirot, I--

1135
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,342
Well, I have to get clearance
on this, you know.

1136
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,592
Go on.

1137
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,585
Yeah.

1138
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,885
- All right, I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, Chief Inspector.

1139
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,962
- Mr Hercule Poirot, sir.

1140
01:18:00,671 --> 01:18:02,420
- Thank you.

1141
01:18:02,546 --> 01:18:04,629
- This is about
Miss Sainsbury Seale, is it?

1142
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:05,880
Have you found her?

1143
01:18:05,949 --> 01:18:07,823
- I hope you do not object,
Monsieur Blunt,

1144
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,906
but I have invited a few
other people to join us.

1145
01:18:18,283 --> 01:18:21,125
- I'm not walking through
the streets in handcuffs.

1146
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:23,175
- You'll walk
through the streets

1147
01:18:23,343 --> 01:18:25,884
in anything I tell you, my lad.

1148
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:32,745
- I hope this is a matter
of importance, Alistair.

1149
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:36,579
That Belgian detective sent
a most insolent message to us.

1150
01:18:36,705 --> 01:18:38,996
- Mother.

1151
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:57,680
- Miss Neville to see you, sir.

1152
01:18:57,847 --> 01:18:59,931
- Mademoiselle Neville.

1153
01:19:00,057 --> 01:19:02,472
- Are there many more,
Monsieur Poirot?

1154
01:19:02,598 --> 01:19:05,847
If so, we may be more
comfortable in the boardroom.

1155
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:08,390
Is the boardroom free,
Miss Montressor?

1156
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:10,223
- Yes, Mr Blunt.

1157
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,891
- Frank!

1158
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:23,280
- All right, all right. You're still
in His Majesty's custody, you know.

1159
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:25,655
Show a bit of respect.
Come on.

1160
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:32,614
- Mesdames et messieurs,

1161
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,323
good afternoon.

1162
01:19:35,449 --> 01:19:37,949
Since the beginning
of this case,

1163
01:19:38,116 --> 01:19:39,532
three people have died:

1164
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:42,907
pauvre Monsieur Morley,
pauvre Monsieur Amberiotis,

1165
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:45,066
and pauvre
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1166
01:19:45,135 --> 01:19:46,676
- I thought she was
still missing.

1167
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:49,218
- No, no, no, no, mademoiselle.

1168
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:51,844
In fact, Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale was dead

1169
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:55,510
even before the investigations
of this case began.

1170
01:19:55,636 --> 01:20:00,511
The porter at Lichfield Court
told us

1171
01:20:00,637 --> 01:20:02,303
that Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale

1172
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:05,261
had been to visit
Madame Chapman.

1173
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:08,846
He saw her go to the apartment
and be let in.

1174
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:11,887
She never came out again, no?

1175
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,805
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
was never, ever seen again

1176
01:20:14,931 --> 01:20:17,680
until the police, they broke in
to the boxroom

1177
01:20:17,806 --> 01:20:18,797
of Madame Chapman.

1178
01:20:18,823 --> 01:20:20,863
- You mean it was
Mabelle Sainsbury Seale's body

1179
01:20:20,931 --> 01:20:22,473
in that flat after all?

1180
01:20:22,599 --> 01:20:24,948
- Indeed it was,
my dear Mademoiselle Neville.

1181
01:20:25,026 --> 01:20:28,358
You see, it was a very clever
double bluff.

1182
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:31,651
The disfigured face was meant
to raise the question

1183
01:20:31,777 --> 01:20:34,901
of the identity of the woman.

1184
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:39,902
But for me, the case,
it began with a shoe.

1185
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:45,403
As I left the dentist's
after my séance,

1186
01:20:45,529 --> 01:20:49,194
a taxi stopped, a door opened,

1187
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,219
and a foot of a woman
prepared to descend.

1188
01:20:51,545 --> 01:20:53,762
It was a foot
that was well shaped,

1189
01:20:53,839 --> 01:20:58,213
with a good ankle
and an expensive stocking.

1190
01:20:58,339 --> 01:21:01,339
The shoe was new, shining
patent leather

1191
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:03,730
with a large, ornate buckle.

1192
01:21:04,473 --> 01:21:06,806
And when the rest of the lady
came into sight,

1193
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:11,307
to be frank,
it was quite a disappointment.

1194
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:15,183
As Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
descended from the taxi,

1195
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:19,058
she caught her shoe buckle,
and it was wrenched off.

1196
01:21:20,289 --> 01:21:22,080
I picked it up
and returned it to her.

1197
01:21:22,207 --> 01:21:23,539
Not at all, madame.

1198
01:21:23,665 --> 01:21:26,414
- Ooh.
- Oh, dear.

1199
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:27,956
You are welcome, madame.

1200
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:29,999
- Thank you so much.

1201
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,040
- That was all.

1202
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:36,540
The incident, it was closed.

1203
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:42,458
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Blunt,
to interrupt.

1204
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:43,958
I've finished the post.

1205
01:21:44,084 --> 01:21:45,251
Is it all right if I leave now?

1206
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:46,459
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1207
01:21:46,585 --> 01:21:48,501
Please, Mademoiselle Montressor.

1208
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,042
Please come and join the party.

1209
01:21:50,168 --> 01:21:51,834
- Monsieur Poirot is expounding

1210
01:21:52,002 --> 01:21:53,918
some extremely entertaining
theories.

1211
01:21:54,086 --> 01:21:55,543
- Please.

1212
01:22:07,712 --> 01:22:09,294
- Go on, Poirot.

1213
01:22:09,462 --> 01:22:11,502
- Thank you.

1214
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:16,295
When Chief Inspector Japp
summoned me to Lichfield Court

1215
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:19,128
because a body
had been discovered,

1216
01:22:19,254 --> 01:22:24,171
the first thing that I noticed
was a shabby buckled shoe.

1217
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:27,213
- Well?

1218
01:22:27,339 --> 01:22:30,414
- Ah, you have failed to appreciate
the point, Monsieur Blunt.

1219
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,889
It was a shabby shoe.

1220
01:22:33,644 --> 01:22:36,226
It was a well-worn shoe.

1221
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:39,394
But, you see,
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1222
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,894
visited the apartment
on the evening of the same day

1223
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,519
of the murder
of Monsieur Morley.

1224
01:22:44,645 --> 01:22:46,312
So in the morning,
they were the new shoes.

1225
01:22:46,438 --> 01:22:48,145
In the evening,
they were the old shoes?

1226
01:22:48,313 --> 01:22:51,020
- I can't see why
that's important.

1227
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:52,896
- Eh bien, mademoiselle.

1228
01:22:53,022 --> 01:22:56,688
Poirot does not like things
he cannot explain.

1229
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:01,839
Madame Chapman took a size five
in shoes.

1230
01:23:02,452 --> 01:23:04,660
I knew that
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1231
01:23:04,786 --> 01:23:06,076
wore a ten-inch stocking.

1232
01:23:06,202 --> 01:23:10,252
That is to say, she took
at least a size six in shoes.

1233
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:14,430
So I went back
to reexamine the body.

1234
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:18,098
My idea was that the face
had been disfigured

1235
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:20,098
to hide the fact

1236
01:23:20,266 --> 01:23:22,515
that it really was the body
of Madame Chapman

1237
01:23:22,641 --> 01:23:25,482
dressed in the clothes of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1238
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:29,132
No, the shoe on the body
was size six,

1239
01:23:31,059 --> 01:23:32,808
so it looked as if it was
the body

1240
01:23:32,934 --> 01:23:36,058
of Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale after all.

1241
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:38,793
But then why was the face
so disfigured?

1242
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,459
By coincidence, the dentist
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1243
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:45,159
was also the dentist
of Madame Chapman:

1244
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:46,639
Monsieur Morley.

1245
01:23:46,765 --> 01:23:49,055
But he was dead.

1246
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:52,722
However, the records, they
would have still existed, huh?

1247
01:23:52,848 --> 01:23:54,423
So the successor
to Monsieur Morley

1248
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:56,490
would have been able
to positively identify the body

1249
01:23:56,516 --> 01:23:58,306
as that of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1250
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:02,557
- And could you identify
the body from these records?

1251
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:05,207
- I could, sir. It was not
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

1252
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:08,417
It was Mrs Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr Morley's.

1253
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:11,990
- But if it was the body
of Madame Chapman,

1254
01:24:12,116 --> 01:24:13,657
why was she dressed
in the clothes

1255
01:24:13,783 --> 01:24:17,491
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale?

1256
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:20,743
An interesting problem,
n'est-ce pas?

1257
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:23,577
So I cast my mind back

1258
01:24:23,703 --> 01:24:26,577
to the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale whom I had met,

1259
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:28,644
whom the Chief Inspector Japp
had met.

1260
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,145
- I used to be an actress.

1261
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:31,854
Just small parts, you know.

1262
01:24:32,022 --> 01:24:35,729
Then I went on a world tour,
and--

1263
01:24:35,855 --> 01:24:37,313
- And although everything
about her

1264
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:38,647
and everything she said

1265
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,772
was in perfect accord
with her given character,

1266
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:44,439
I am now convinced that
the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1267
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:45,522
whom we have met

1268
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,190
and the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale

1269
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:48,940
who accosted you,
Monsieur Blunt...

1270
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:52,473
- You don't remember me. Mabelle.
Gerda and I were on tour together.

1271
01:24:52,499 --> 01:24:54,832
- They were not the same woman.

1272
01:24:55,153 --> 01:24:57,486
- You mean Miss Sainsbury Seale
was murdered

1273
01:24:57,653 --> 01:24:59,902
and someone else took over
her identity?

1274
01:24:59,989 --> 01:25:02,989
- Précisément.

1275
01:25:03,115 --> 01:25:08,031
Again, that is very dangerous,
n'est-ce pas?

1276
01:25:08,157 --> 01:25:12,740
But the rewards,
they were very high.

1277
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:15,524
- Rewards? What rewards?

1278
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:19,450
- In just one moment,
if you please, Madame Olivera.

1279
01:25:19,576 --> 01:25:22,492
- Perhaps Mr. Morley
was murdered

1280
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,243
because he would have been able
to identify

1281
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,785
Miss Sainsbury Seale's body
by her teeth.

1282
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:29,618
- Perhaps.

1283
01:25:29,744 --> 01:25:31,410
However...

1284
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:37,577
Now we must face the facts.

1285
01:25:38,694 --> 01:25:42,319
In the beginning, we believed
that the body of Monsieur Morley

1286
01:25:42,445 --> 01:25:44,777
was first discovered
by the pageboy, Alfred,

1287
01:25:44,903 --> 01:25:47,153
at about 1:30.

1288
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:52,986
But the fact is, I now know that
the body was first discovered

1289
01:25:53,112 --> 01:25:56,287
by Monsieur Frank Carter
about one hour earlier,

1290
01:25:56,354 --> 01:25:59,562
at about 12:30.

1291
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:07,751
Two things occurred

1292
01:26:07,877 --> 01:26:10,419
between the death
of Monsieur Morley

1293
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:13,761
and the discovery of his body
by Monsieur Carter.

1294
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:16,629
The lady whose shoe buckle
I retrieved

1295
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:20,339
was shown into the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.

1296
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,706
While her accomplice
dragged the body

1297
01:26:29,732 --> 01:26:31,481
into the office
of the secretary,

1298
01:26:31,707 --> 01:26:33,882
the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1299
01:26:33,952 --> 01:26:37,618
changes the labels on the files
of Monsieur Morley

1300
01:26:37,786 --> 01:26:40,702
to ensure that the body
would be identified

1301
01:26:40,818 --> 01:26:43,692
as that of Madame Chapman.

1302
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:49,151
She then leaves.

1303
01:26:49,277 --> 01:26:51,318
Alfred shows in the next patient

1304
01:26:51,444 --> 01:26:53,401
to the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.

1305
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,728
Now, Monsieur Amberiotis had
never before met the dentist,

1306
01:27:04,854 --> 01:27:06,228
Monsieur Morley.

1307
01:27:06,396 --> 01:27:09,896
- It's been troubling me
since the journey from India.

1308
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:16,354
- So our murderer, he was able
to assume his identity.

1309
01:27:17,268 --> 01:27:20,977
This dentist tells
to Monsieur Amberiotis

1310
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:24,227
that it would be best
to freeze the gum.

1311
01:27:26,812 --> 01:27:28,569
He then administers an injection

1312
01:27:28,647 --> 01:27:32,689
which contains a dose
of novocaine and adrenaline

1313
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:36,897
which is sufficient to kill him
six hours later.

1314
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,712
- But why?

1315
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,921
Why would anyone want
to kill this man?

1316
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:45,296
- Because Monsieur Amberiotis
had learned something

1317
01:27:45,422 --> 01:27:47,922
from Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale.

1318
01:27:48,048 --> 01:27:50,005
He had learned a secret...

1319
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:54,880
And a secret that could make him
a very rich man.

1320
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:06,409
- I wish to speak
to Mr Alistair Blunt.

1321
01:28:06,577 --> 01:28:11,660
- And Monsieur Amberiotis,
he was a blackmailer.

1322
01:28:13,494 --> 01:28:17,577
- Are you seriously suggesting
Amberiotis was blackmailing me?

1323
01:28:17,745 --> 01:28:20,286
- How could he blackmail
Alistair?

1324
01:28:20,412 --> 01:28:22,244
Alistair has no secrets.

1325
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,579
- With the greatest respect,
Madame Olivera,

1326
01:28:25,705 --> 01:28:28,787
there I must disagree with you.

1327
01:28:29,246 --> 01:28:31,279
Monsieur Blunt has
a very big secret,

1328
01:28:31,326 --> 01:28:34,242
a secret that must be kept
at all costs.

1329
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:38,909
And there is only one method
that is totally effective

1330
01:28:39,035 --> 01:28:42,618
in dealing with a blackmailer,
and that is to silence him...

1331
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:45,467
Forever.

1332
01:28:45,635 --> 01:28:51,218
No, Monsieur Amberiotis,
he had to go.

1333
01:28:51,344 --> 01:28:53,885
And Monsieur Blunt had seen
the name of Monsieur Amberiotis

1334
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:57,011
in the appointment book
belonging to Monsieur Morley.

1335
01:28:57,137 --> 01:29:00,427
His blackmailer used
the same dentist.

1336
01:29:00,553 --> 01:29:02,969
- That'll do for today, I think.

1337
01:29:03,096 --> 01:29:07,720
One more rinse, please.

1338
01:29:07,846 --> 01:29:11,221
- And so, Monsieur Blunt,
you devise a clever plan,

1339
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:16,054
a very clever plan indeed.

1340
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,889
You wait until your treatment
has been completed

1341
01:29:19,015 --> 01:29:21,639
by Monsieur Morley.

1342
01:29:31,384 --> 01:29:34,801
Then you shoot him.

1343
01:29:42,261 --> 01:29:45,385
While the dental records
are being falsified,

1344
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:49,761
you drag the body into
the office of the secretary.

1345
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:09,126
As I have said,
Monsieur Amberiotis

1346
01:30:09,252 --> 01:30:11,502
had never before met
Monsieur Morley,

1347
01:30:11,628 --> 01:30:15,669
so there was no reason
for him to suspect anything.

1348
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:24,378
You administer to him
the fatal injection.

1349
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,088
And when he has left, you drag
the body of Monsieur Morley

1350
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:34,922
back into the surgery...

1351
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:39,344
And arrange it
to look like suicide.

1352
01:30:54,476 --> 01:30:58,392
- I know, Monsieur Poirot,
you have a great reputation.

1353
01:30:58,977 --> 01:31:00,267
But I'm afraid in this case,

1354
01:31:00,393 --> 01:31:02,042
you are wrong
to a lunatic degree.

1355
01:31:02,064 --> 01:31:05,106
- Send him about his business,
Alistair.

1356
01:31:05,232 --> 01:31:09,564
Mr Blunt's family stands
foursquare behind him.

1357
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:13,982
- I am very pleased to hear it,
Madame Olivera.

1358
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:16,065
But, you see,

1359
01:31:16,191 --> 01:31:19,233
when Monsieur Blunt
married your sister,

1360
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:22,941
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt,

1361
01:31:23,067 --> 01:31:25,024
he was not entirely honest
with her, no,

1362
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:27,067
nor with her family,

1363
01:31:27,193 --> 01:31:30,150
because, as Monsieur Amberiotis
learned

1364
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,317
from the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,

1365
01:31:33,443 --> 01:31:38,235
Monsieur Blunt
was already married.

1366
01:31:38,361 --> 01:31:40,818
- Look, there's no need
for the rest of you

1367
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:42,402
to listen to any more of this.

1368
01:31:42,528 --> 01:31:44,111
If you--
- No, no, no, Monsieur Blunt.

1369
01:31:44,278 --> 01:31:45,944
You were dazzled
by the Arnholt family,

1370
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,877
by the vista not so much
of wealth but of power.

1371
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:51,937
And so dazzled were you that you
deliberately committed a bigamy

1372
01:31:52,063 --> 01:31:54,562
and your real wife acquiesced
in the situation.

1373
01:31:54,688 --> 01:31:56,021
- Oh, what rot!

1374
01:31:56,147 --> 01:31:59,063
- What a fine portrait is this,
Monsieur Blunt!

1375
01:31:59,189 --> 01:32:02,105
Such a portrait would be
to any boardroom an ornament!

1376
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:05,439
Monsieur Blunt standing beside
his beloved wife,

1377
01:32:05,565 --> 01:32:08,989
the former
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt!

1378
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:13,724
However, mesdames et messieurs,

1379
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,690
I have here in my pocket

1380
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:21,327
a certificate of marriage

1381
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,902
between Martin Alistair Blunt

1382
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:28,557
and an actress by the name of
Mademoiselle Gerda Alexandra Grant

1383
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:34,499
dated April the 25th, 1925.

1384
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:39,925
And Mademoiselle Gerda Grant
is still very much alive.

1385
01:32:41,251 --> 01:32:43,684
Yes.

1386
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,592
Indeed, she is
in this very room.

1387
01:33:04,363 --> 01:33:06,671
- And when I lived,
I was your other wife.

1388
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:11,038
And when you loved,
you were my other husband.

1389
01:33:11,164 --> 01:33:12,330
Husband.

1390
01:33:12,498 --> 01:33:13,872
- Which is Beatrice?

1391
01:33:13,998 --> 01:33:16,997
- I answer to that name.

1392
01:33:17,123 --> 01:33:19,122
What is your will?

1393
01:33:19,248 --> 01:33:20,207
- Do not you love me?

1394
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:23,623
- Why, no,
no more than reason.

1395
01:33:23,749 --> 01:33:26,123
Don't be so mamby-pamby,
Mabelle.

1396
01:33:26,249 --> 01:33:28,958
You think he's not good enough
for me.

1397
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:31,833
Come on, Alistair.
I want to dance!

1398
01:33:31,959 --> 01:33:35,124
Dance, dance, dance.

1399
01:33:37,876 --> 01:33:40,083
- Gerda got such a kick
out of it all.

1400
01:33:40,209 --> 01:33:42,333
Didn't you, old girl?

1401
01:33:57,044 --> 01:34:01,586
- It was your skills as an
actress, Mademoiselle Montressor,

1402
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:04,628
that were the key
to the deception.

1403
01:34:04,754 --> 01:34:07,795
You connived at the bigamy
of your husband.

1404
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:11,587
While he set about marrying
into the Arnholt family,

1405
01:34:11,713 --> 01:34:15,171
you assumed the identity
of Madame Sylvia Chapman.

1406
01:34:15,297 --> 01:34:18,213
- After all these years!

1407
01:34:18,339 --> 01:34:20,046
- Hello, Mabelle.

1408
01:34:20,172 --> 01:34:21,339
Come in.

1409
01:34:21,465 --> 01:34:23,506
- I've brought you some flowers.

1410
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:25,381
- When the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1411
01:34:25,507 --> 01:34:26,756
met again your husband,

1412
01:34:26,882 --> 01:34:30,173
you murder your old friend
in cold blood.

1413
01:34:30,808 --> 01:34:34,390
- Go into the sitting room
straight through there.

1414
01:34:36,127 --> 01:34:39,126
- But your skills as an actress
are put to the test once again

1415
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:42,501
as the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1416
01:34:42,627 --> 01:34:44,918
- Ooh!

1417
01:34:47,669 --> 01:34:48,835
So kind.

1418
01:34:48,961 --> 01:34:50,919
- Not at all, madame.

1419
01:34:51,045 --> 01:34:52,128
- Ooh!

1420
01:34:52,254 --> 01:34:55,711
- Unfortunately for you,
it was Hercule Poirot

1421
01:34:55,837 --> 01:34:59,337
who retrieved your shoe buckle
that day.

1422
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:03,170
But having safely deceived

1423
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:06,821
the Chief Inspector Japp and
myself, or so you thought,

1424
01:35:07,171 --> 01:35:09,504
you took the opportunity
to be as close as possible

1425
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,554
to your husband.

1426
01:35:10,659 --> 01:35:14,825
You assumed the name
of Helen Montressor

1427
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:19,325
and joined him as
his new, efficient secretary.

1428
01:35:21,286 --> 01:35:24,518
- We'll never make these people
understand, will we, my darling?

1429
01:35:24,644 --> 01:35:28,426
Such ordinary, unimaginative
people.

1430
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:31,402
I wish I could make you
understand, Monsieur Poirot,

1431
01:35:31,569 --> 01:35:33,777
about my meeting with Rebecca
and my marriage.

1432
01:35:33,903 --> 01:35:37,319
Gerda understood,
didn't you, old girl?

1433
01:35:37,445 --> 01:35:39,403
We could have married again
after Rebecca's death,

1434
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:44,987
but, do you know, we'd come
to rather enjoy all the secrecy.

1435
01:35:45,113 --> 01:35:46,820
She's an actress
through and through.

1436
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,279
She would have found it
very dull

1437
01:35:48,405 --> 01:35:50,945
being just one character.

1438
01:35:51,071 --> 01:35:53,071
Well...

1439
01:35:53,197 --> 01:35:55,821
I've killed three people, so
presumably I ought to hang.

1440
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:58,745
But haven't I done something
for England?

1441
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:00,870
I have held it firm.

1442
01:36:00,996 --> 01:36:02,536
I have kept it solvent.

1443
01:36:02,662 --> 01:36:06,161
I have kept it free
from dictators.

1444
01:36:06,288 --> 01:36:10,196
I am necessary to the continuing
peace and well-being of this nation.

1445
01:36:10,552 --> 01:36:12,551
- Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

1446
01:36:12,677 --> 01:36:14,302
- What about me?

1447
01:36:14,428 --> 01:36:16,218
He was gonna let me hang.

1448
01:36:16,344 --> 01:36:19,093
- Précisément.

1449
01:36:19,261 --> 01:36:23,094
Monsieur Blunt,
with his usual efficiency,

1450
01:36:23,262 --> 01:36:26,344
had provided for himself
a second line of defense.

1451
01:36:26,453 --> 01:36:29,245
If things went wrong,
you, Monsieur Carter,

1452
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:32,750
you were to be
the scapegoat.

1453
01:36:32,802 --> 01:36:36,260
You see, by now,
Monsieur Blunt knows

1454
01:36:36,386 --> 01:36:38,927
of Monsieur Morley's opinion
regarding you,

1455
01:36:39,053 --> 01:36:41,511
and so he arranges
for you to be engaged

1456
01:36:41,637 --> 01:36:45,720
in a most mysterious fashion
as a gardener.

1457
01:36:45,888 --> 01:36:48,387
Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.

1458
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:50,387
And how easy
for Helen Montressor

1459
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:53,971
to fire a shot
vaguely in your direction,

1460
01:36:54,097 --> 01:36:56,638
drop the pistol at your feet,

1461
01:36:56,764 --> 01:36:58,096
where you are bound
to pick it up?

1462
01:36:58,222 --> 01:37:00,847
- Drop that gun!
Help!

1463
01:37:00,973 --> 01:37:02,222
Oh, Mr Blunt!

1464
01:37:02,348 --> 01:37:03,722
- You are caught red-handed,

1465
01:37:03,848 --> 01:37:05,789
and of course nobody is going
to believe your story,

1466
01:37:05,815 --> 01:37:07,006
your ridiculous story

1467
01:37:07,232 --> 01:37:10,231
about being employed
by the secret service.

1468
01:37:11,082 --> 01:37:12,115
No.

1469
01:37:12,646 --> 01:37:15,412
As far as Monsieur Blunt
is concerned,

1470
01:37:15,589 --> 01:37:18,713
you can end your short life
on the gallows.

1471
01:37:18,839 --> 01:37:22,173
- I don't waste pity
on people like him.

1472
01:37:23,666 --> 01:37:25,123
- Eh bien, Monsieur Blunt.

1473
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:27,790
That is where you and I,
we do not see alike,

1474
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:31,582
for to me, the lives
of those three people

1475
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:34,407
are just as important
as your own life.

1476
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:40,388
Monsieur Blunt,

1477
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:44,138
you talk of the continued peace
of this nation, huh?

1478
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:46,597
Oh, yes, that is very good.

1479
01:37:46,723 --> 01:37:50,514
But Poirot is not concerned
with nations.

1480
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,723
Poirot is concerned
with private individuals,

1481
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:59,766
who have the right not to have
taken from them their lives.

1482
01:38:02,392 --> 01:38:06,583
- Martin Alistair Blunt
and Gerda Alexandra Blunt,

1483
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:10,025
I arrest you
on charges of murder.

1484
01:38:14,575 --> 01:38:17,575
- Please.

1485
01:38:33,328 --> 01:38:37,703
Oh, my--my poor dear sister.

1486
01:38:42,204 --> 01:38:45,245
I don't know why I'm crying.

1487
01:38:45,371 --> 01:38:47,454
- Come on, Mother.

1488
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:51,287
- I never liked him anyway.

1489
01:38:51,413 --> 01:38:54,413
- Why don't we go back home?

1490
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:56,638
To New York.

1491
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:07,615
- That could have been me,
you know.

1492
01:39:07,783 --> 01:39:10,074
- I think I'm going to keep
a close eye on you in future,

1493
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,316
Frank Carter.

1494
01:39:11,383 --> 01:39:13,624
You're not safe out on your own.

1495
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:16,858
Secret service.

1496
01:39:26,197 --> 01:39:27,779
- Look at it, Poirot,

1497
01:39:27,905 --> 01:39:30,530
the trappings
of wealth and power.

1498
01:39:30,656 --> 01:39:32,072
And yet underneath it all...

1499
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,530
- Yes, Chief Inspector?

1500
01:39:33,656 --> 01:39:35,405
- Well, I mean,
it just shows you, doesn't it?

1501
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:38,198
They're no better than we are
when it comes down to it.

1502
01:39:38,365 --> 01:39:39,573
It's the little chaps

1503
01:39:39,699 --> 01:39:41,989
that keep things
on an even keel,

1504
01:39:42,115 --> 01:39:43,406
chaps like you and me.

1505
01:39:43,532 --> 01:39:44,823
- Ah.

1506
01:39:44,949 --> 01:39:49,074
But there are no little chaps,
Chief Inspector,

1507
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,782
particularly not Poirot.
