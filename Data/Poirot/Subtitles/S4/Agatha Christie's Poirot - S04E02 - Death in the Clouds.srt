1
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,727
- Oh, allow me, mademoiselle.

2
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:08,804
Voilà.

3
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,677
- Thank you.

4
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:15,585
- It is like an enormous
birthday cake, is it not?

5
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:21,130
So strange and so out of place
in this beautiful neighborhood.

6
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,165
Near the end of the last century
when it was being built,

7
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:26,196
so many of the great artists,
they lived here.

8
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:27,473
Oh, yes.

9
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:31,302
Renoir, Manet, van Gogh,
so many.

10
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:33,177
It amuses me
to imagine their dismay

11
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,371
as they saw it
being constructed.

12
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,564
- Well, actually,
I think it's rather beautiful.

13
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,474
- You know, when they
lived here, mademoiselle,

14
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:45,821
Montmartre was just a village
in the countryside.

15
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,654
Strange church for a village,
n'est-ce pas?

16
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,689
However, for myself,
I am very happy

17
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,281
that it is no longer
the countryside.

18
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:56,911
I greatly prefer under my feet
the paving stones.

19
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,547
Excuse me.

20
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:15,899
- On demande Monsieur Johnson.

21
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,691
Paging Mr. Johnson.

22
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,722
On demande Monsieur Johnson.

23
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:23,478
Paging Mr. Johnson.

24
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,831
- I'd much rather spend
the afternoon shopping.

25
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,547
There are so many gorgeous shops
in Paris.

26
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:28,863
It's quite absurd.

27
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,658
- We've already bought
the tickets, darling.

28
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:32,174
- It is why we came, Cecily.

29
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,208
- Yes, Venetia, thank you.

30
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,604
I do realize.

31
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,599
But I didn't realize

32
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,394
we'd spend the whole week
watching tennis.

33
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:42,066
For goodness' sake.

34
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,337
Well, really!

35
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,491
I do think Frenchmen
are so rude.

36
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,126
Don't you, Venetia?

37
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,657
Where's Madeleine?

38
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,048
Madeleine!

39
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,111
Fetch my cigarettes, will you?

40
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:10,786
- Yes, Lady Horbury.

41
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,891
- Quarante, trente.

42
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,447
Jeu, Monsieur Perry.

43
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:09,664
Monsieur Perry mène
par quatre jeux à trois

44
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:13,055
dans le premier set.

45
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,687
- Excuse me.

46
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,275
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,234
- He was jolly good,
even you must admit, Cecily.

48
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,627
- Who was?

49
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,222
- Fred Perry, darling,

50
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,097
the English one.

51
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:42,932
- I wish I'd seen Perry
at Wimbledon last year.

52
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,128
They say he was marvelous.

53
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,123
- Well, let's hope he wins again
in the final.

54
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,118
- Yes, that would be nice,
wouldn't it?

55
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:53,663
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:56,335
- I felt I ought to apologize...

57
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,608
in case my clapping
deafened you.

58
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,965
Oh, no, don't worry.

59
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,202
- Did you enjoy the game?

60
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,438
- Oh, yes.

61
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,074
It's a wonderful tournament,
isn't it?

62
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:05,270
- I'm Norman Gale.

63
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,265
- Jane Grey.

64
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,220
- Wasn't she a queen
or something?

65
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:10,974
- Briefly.
No relation, I'm afraid.

66
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,410
I'm just an air stewardess.

67
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,564
- Well, I hope you're not flying
back before the final.

68
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,240
- Oh, no, no, definitely not.

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,556
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

70
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,550
- Good.

71
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,503
- Garçon!

72
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,414
Garçon!

73
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,241
Oh, for heaven's sake!

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,473
- Dix rouge.

75
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:53,337
- Merci.

76
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,013
- Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

77
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,408
Faites vos jeux.

78
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,637
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

79
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,392
Faites vos jeux.

80
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,093
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,792
- Quinze noir.

82
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:18,707
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

83
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,183
Faites vos jeux.

84
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,611
- That was a lovely dinner.
Thank you, Stephen.

85
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,922
- Glad you enjoyed it.

86
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:31,193
- You mustn't worry about Cecily
not turning up.

87
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,467
Really.

88
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,258
There's probably
a perfectly good reason.

89
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,447
She's probably
back at the hotel now.

90
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,758
- She's been worse than ever
this week.

91
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,912
It was marvelous that you
could come with us, Venetia.

92
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:47,547
- Oh, well.

93
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,379
I'm very good at being
a friend of the family.

94
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,135
It's my role in life, I think.

95
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:54,488
- Oh.

96
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,722
- Bonsoir, madame.
Bonsoir, monsieur.

97
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:59,195
- Good evening.

98
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,132
- Oh, madame.

99
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:23,927
- Madame Giselle,
s'il vous plaît.

100
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,801
- Le premier étage.

101
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,046
I will not tolerate it!

102
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,202
Do you understand?

103
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,074
I will not tolerate it!

104
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,345
Hello, darling.

105
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,382
Can't you sleep?

106
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,855
- It's 3:00.

107
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:18,491
- Is it?

108
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,007
- Did you see her?

109
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:21,163
- Who?

110
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:22,560
- That woman.

111
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:27,706
- I might have paid her
just a little visit, Stephen.

112
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,700
On the other hand,
I might not.

113
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,854
- I suppose you went
to the casino.

114
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:36,083
- I might have spent
just a few francs, yes, Stephen,

115
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,558
I must confess.

116
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,832
- I'm not helping anymore,
Cecily.

117
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:40,869
I'm simply not.

118
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:42,664
You'll just have to tell her!

119
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:45,456
- Oh, don't get so excited,
darling.

120
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,415
You and Venetia love
riding around on horses,

121
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,808
and I love smoking
and drinking

122
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,199
and losing money
at the roulette table.

123
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,513
So long as we all leave
each other to our own devices,

124
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,783
I don't see what the problem is.

125
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:23,192
- I'm going back to London
in the morning.

126
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:25,585
- And miss the final?

127
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,019
What will Venetia think?

128
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,575
- Ah, mademoiselle.

129
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:15,169
I did not take you for
an admirer of the avant-garde.

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,123
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

131
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,422
You are a little baffled
by what you see?

132
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,294
- Yes, I'm afraid I am,
actually.

133
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,369
- Well, it's hardly surprising,
mademoiselle.

134
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,284
The surrealists, you see,
they free themselves

135
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,039
from the demands of logic.

136
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,914
They do not paint
what we see before us,

137
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,389
the real world as we call it.

138
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,786
No, no, no.

139
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:41,097
No, they struggle to express
the unconscious,

140
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,410
the dream world.

141
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,159
So one cannot approach their
work in way that has logic.

142
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,636
You have to experience it.

143
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,830
You have to open your mind
to it.

144
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,981
That is all.

145
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,856
Come.
I will show you more.

146
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,201
So, Mademoiselle Grey,

147
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:03,156
how does the world look

148
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:06,785
now that the surrealists
have opened your mind to it?

149
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,857
- It's all looking
a little strange now actually.

150
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,091
But I'm sure
it's only temporary.

151
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,405
It's been fascinating
meeting you, Mr. Poirot.

152
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,200
- Ah, no, no, no, no.
You are too kind.

153
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,034
- No, it has.

154
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:21,504
But now there's a little bit
of Paris I'd like to show you,

155
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,938
somewhere I'm almost sure
you've never been.

156
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,132
- Oh, I have seen much of Paris,
Mademoiselle Grey.

157
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:28,286
Do not be so sure.

158
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,535
You are very clever,
Mademoiselle Grey,

159
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:43,843
to obtain for me a seat
at such short notice.

160
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,476
- That's your seat there.

161
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:49,268
- Well, thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.

162
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,305
You are too kind.

163
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,342
- I'll see you later.

164
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,340
- Indeed.
Au revoir.

165
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,935
- Au revoir.

166
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,366
- Excuse me.
Pardon.

167
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:04,865
Pardon.

168
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:14,957
- I really don't know why
you're staying, Cecily.

169
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,270
Why didn't you go back
with Stephen?

170
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,584
- Perhaps because even this
is preferable

171
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:20,781
to being stuck in the country

172
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,536
with all that mud
and horse manure.

173
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,132
- Oh, you must have known
what he was like

174
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,448
before you married him.

175
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,200
- One never knows
what one's husband is like

176
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,155
before one marries him.

177
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,349
That's one of the problems
with marriage.

178
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,043
- Are you sure you're
not staying for other reasons?

179
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,160
- What do you mean?

180
00:12:57,441 --> 00:13:00,432
- What about that actor friend
of yours?

181
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,346
Isn't he keen on tennis?

182
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:12,358
- Trente par tout.

183
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:37,409
Trente, quarante.

184
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,668
- It is interesting, is it not,

185
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:48,061
how the British regard tennis
as their own invention

186
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,253
and any tennis trophy
as rightfully theirs?

187
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:54,006
When the truth is,
it was a French game originally.

188
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,561
Jeu de pomme.

189
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,077
11th century, I think.

190
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,789
- It was a jolly good game,
wasn't it?

191
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:02,143
And Perry absolutely thrashed
von Cramm.

192
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,089
Are either of you
going to Wimbledon?

193
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,924
- For myself, I think not.

194
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:11,038
- Depends if I can get
the time off.

195
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,594
- Me too.

196
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,705
- Some more.
Garçon!

197
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,577
Garçon!

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,954
- You've had enough, Cecily.

199
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,412
- I have nothing for you,
madame, nothing.

200
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,007
Do you hear?

201
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,563
The cupboard is bare.

202
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:55,435
No more money,
comprenez?

203
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:02,815
- Pardon, madame.

204
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,903
- Good morning, sir.
Welcome aboard.

205
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,698
- I hear Miss Grey
will be traveling with us,

206
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,573
ready to cater
for our every need.

207
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:35,285
- How delightful,
a little party.

208
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:37,599
Ah, and there are two more
to join us,

209
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,032
two more aficionados
of the game of tennis.

210
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:41,468
- Oh, yes.

211
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,383
Yes, I saw them yesterday.
What a coincidence.

212
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,816
- No, no, no, no, Monsieur Gale,
it is not a coincidence.

213
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,252
You will go to Paris
for the tennis.

214
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:48,688
The tennis finishes.
You go home.

215
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,683
What could be more logical?

216
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,196
- Bonjour, monsieur.

217
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,470
Le Bourget, s'il vous plaît.

218
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,040
- Au revoir, Elise.

219
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,117
A bien tôt.

220
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,390
- Au revoir, madame.

221
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,498
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

222
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:30,014
- It'll be in here, sir,
if you need it.

223
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,051
- Thank you.

224
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:32,766
- Morning.
- Good morning.

225
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,598
You're at the end, Mr. Gale,
on the right.

226
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,032
- Call me Norman, if you like.

227
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,824
- I shall have a rug,
if I may.

228
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:41,981
Thank you.

229
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,017
- Uh, your hat, sir.

230
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,654
- Thank you very much.

231
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:47,485
Thank you.

232
00:16:58,695 --> 00:16:59,931
- This way, ladies.

233
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:03,322
Lady Horbury.

234
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,596
Miss Kerr.

235
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:10,941
- Is everything all right,
Mr. Dupont?

236
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,177
- Yes.

237
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:13,892
- Would you like me to take
your case for you?

238
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,206
- No, no, it contains
valuable archaeological pieces.

239
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:19,277
Equatorial African pipes,
you see?

240
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,950
For a lecture I'm giving to the
British Archaeological Society.

241
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,025
- Really?
How interesting.

242
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:25,739
If you'll excuse me.

243
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:33,637
This way, madame.

244
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,664
- Excuse me for asking, sir,

245
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:40,339
but I couldn't help wondering.

246
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,254
Would you, by any chance,
be Mr. Daniel Clancy,

247
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:43,491
the detective writer?

248
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,727
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.

249
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:46,163
- I'd just like to say, sir,

250
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:48,277
I'm a great admirer
of your Wilbraham Rice stories.

251
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,474
He's so brilliant,

252
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:50,790
a real genius,

253
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,585
the way he can always work out
who did it.

254
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,500
- Yes.

255
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,452
Yes, I don't know how he does it
myself sometimes.

256
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:00,922
- Ow!
My fingernail.

257
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:17,197
Steward!

258
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,016
- What can I do for you, madame?

259
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,612
- Get me my maid.

260
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,048
She's in the other compartment.

261
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:29,443
Tell her to bring
my dressing case.

262
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,239
- Yes, madame.

263
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,615
- Thank you, Madeleine.
That'll be all.

264
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:18,063
- Are you all right, sir?

265
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,618
- No, I am not all right.
Thank you.

266
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,052
How can I be all right?

267
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,927
- Would you like something
to drink, sir?

268
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:26,839
- No.
Thank you.

269
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,594
Mon estomac.

270
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,249
- Ah.

271
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,827
- Would you like some food,
Norman?

272
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,782
- Yes, please.

273
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,309
- If you wouldn't mind, Cecily.

274
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:10,296
No.
My throat.

275
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,404
- Of course not, dear.

276
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,525
- Anything for you, sir?
- Uh, no, thank you.

277
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,799
- More coffee, sir?

278
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,304
Coffee, miss?

279
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,138
Lady Horbury?

280
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:37,495
More coffee, sir?

281
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:40,287
- Hmm?
Uh, no, thank you.

282
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,999
- No, thank you.

283
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,675
- Madame?

284
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:48,066
More coffee, madame?

285
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,060
Madame?

286
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:55,565
Oh, my God.

287
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,516
Is there a doctor?

288
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:00,232
- What is it?

289
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:02,944
- Is anyone a doctor?

290
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,819
- I'm a dentist
if I can be of any help.

291
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,813
- What is it?
What has happened?

292
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,285
- I'm afraid she's dead.

293
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,274
- What--what is it, a fit?

294
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,787
- No.

295
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,023
No, I think not.

296
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,380
Regardez.

297
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,412
- It's a wasp sting.

298
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:39,443
I killed a wasp with my cup.

299
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:42,874
- Yes, I saw it too.

300
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,148
- People do die of wasp stings,
but...

301
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,663
- You must go back
to your seats,

302
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:47,740
please, gentlemen.

303
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,894
We're about to land.

304
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:52,407
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?

305
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:53,923
- Another wasp?

306
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,748
- Yes, it is very like a wasp.

307
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,182
But it is not a wasp.

308
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:11,817
- Goodness, it's a dart.

309
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:15,486
A native dart.

310
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,960
South American, I think.

311
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,875
- You have seen one of these
before, monsieur?

312
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:22,228
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.

313
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,382
Better be careful.

314
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:26,536
- Yes, you are right.

315
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,688
We must be very careful,

316
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:34,474
because unless I am
very much mistaken, mes amis,

317
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,625
the end is coated with poison.

318
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,990
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

319
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,250
- No, thank you.

320
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:22,980
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

321
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,046
I'm extremely sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

322
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:30,798
The police won't keep you
very long.

323
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,394
They'll let you go

324
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,587
as soon as they've gone through
your hand luggage.

325
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,343
- Excuse me, Mr. Poirot.
- Yes.

326
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,739
- Would you mind
stepping outside?

327
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,096
- Not at all.

328
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,193
- I knew there was something
suspicious about him.

329
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,185
Didn't I say?

330
00:26:51,502 --> 00:26:52,897
- Thank you.

331
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:56,048
- Well, well, seems you can't
even fly on an airplane now

332
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,880
without somebody
getting murdered.

333
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,115
I've been onto the Sûreté
in Paris.

334
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:03,229
I spoke to a chap
called Fournier.

335
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:04,705
Inspector Fournier?

336
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:06,819
- No.

337
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,052
- I asked him to find out
about the murdered woman,

338
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,528
but he knew
all about her already.

339
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:13,520
Her name's Giselle,
Marie Giselle,

340
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,195
well-known moneylender,

341
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,509
specialized in lending
to society people,

342
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:20,142
always kept an ear open
for their latest scandals,

343
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:21,857
and then used them
to blackmail them

344
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:23,532
when they got behind
with their payments.

345
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:27,003
Anyway, what can you tell me?

346
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,598
I gather you were sitting
just a few yards

347
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,034
from the scene of the crime.

348
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,909
- Well, unfortunately,
Chief Inspector Japp,

349
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,665
at the time of the murder,
I was asleep.

350
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,340
- Asleep?
Really?

351
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,696
Oh, well, well.

352
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,969
Still, I dare say
you have a theory or two

353
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,486
about who committed it.

354
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:42,640
- How could I possibly have
a theory, Chief Inspector,

355
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:44,873
when I still do not
fully comprehend what happened?

356
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,309
- A bit odd, though,
don't you think?

357
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,139
Death by poison dart
on a British airplane?

358
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,048
Bizarre isn't the word.

359
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,840
Jean Dupont.

360
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,858
Large book.

361
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,728
In French.

362
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,642
Cigarette holder.

363
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,993
Ivory, I should say.

364
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:18,541
Small notebook.

365
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,695
Full of scribbled notes.

366
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,712
Ornamental hollow tubes.

367
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:31,265
- African pipes
I think you will find.

368
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:35,972
I was not asleep all
of the time, Chief Inspector.

369
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:38,126
I heard Monsieur Dupont tell it
to the air stewardess,

370
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:39,881
Mademoiselle Jane Grey.

371
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:41,996
Monsieur Dupont,
he is an archaeologist.

372
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,748
- Could be what we're after.

373
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,941
- What exactly are you after,
Chief Inspector?

374
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:50,172
- Well, the question
I'm asking myself, Poirot,

375
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:53,045
is how did the dart
get into the body?

376
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,677
- Ah, you refer, I assume,

377
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:57,752
to the method used
by the South American Indians,

378
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,707
who shoot the native thorns,

379
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,661
such as was discovered
by the body,

380
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,336
through the wooden tube,
n'est-ce pas?

381
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,533
- Well, yes.

382
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:06,806
How do you know
about South American Indians?

383
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:10,477
- Because I have talked
to Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

384
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:14,226
The well-known writer
of the detective stories?

385
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:17,019
And creator of the celebrated
gentleman detective,

386
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,013
Monsieur Wilbraham Rice?

387
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,808
No?

388
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:27,190
Voilà.

389
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:28,467
Well, Monsieur Clancy

390
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:30,701
was one of the passengers
on the airplane.

391
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,176
He has researched
into the subject

392
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,809
for one of his books.

393
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,206
- Oh, has he?

394
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,476
- Oui.
Well, so he tells me.

395
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:42,229
If you please, Chief Inspector,
when you are finished,

396
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:43,705
could you let me have a copy
of the list

397
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:45,739
of the personal effects
of each passenger?

398
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,814
It would be
of great interest to me.

399
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:49,289
- And why would that
interest you?

400
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,045
What are you looking for?

401
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:52,361
- I do not know.

402
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:55,672
All I know is that
I pursue the object

403
00:29:55,952 --> 00:30:00,099
that will hold the answer
to a question that troubles me.

404
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:04,448
But such are the dilemmas
with which we daily struggle.

405
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:05,724
Are they not?

406
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:06,761
- Heh.

407
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,998
- Excuse me.

408
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:18,648
Very helpful.

409
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,023
Norman Gale.

410
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:31,931
Strand Magazine.

411
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:36,678
England's Glory box of matches.

412
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,114
Empty.

413
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:42,143
One white linen coat.

414
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,488
Two dental mirrors.

415
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:52,315
Dental rolls of cotton wool.

416
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,786
Do you reckon he's a dentist,
by any chance?

417
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:02,846
- It's an unforgivable
invasion of privacy.

418
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:05,439
I demand to speak to my husband
and my lawyer at once.

419
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,954
- It won't do any good, Cecily.

420
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:10,425
- It's perfectly normal
procedure, I think you'll find.

421
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,895
After all, the murder weapon
might still be concealed

422
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,611
in someone's bag or case.

423
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,765
- Just take me to a telephone.

424
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,878
- This way, madame.

425
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,916
- You stay here.

426
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,511
- Yes, ma'am.

427
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,586
- I'm sorry, sir, but nobody's
allowed on the plane.

428
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:25,623
Those are my orders.

429
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:26,900
- We need to get on board.

430
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,495
- I've strict instructions.
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:29,931
- But we haven't cleared up
in there.

432
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:31,766
There's coffee cups
and goodness knows what.

433
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:32,803
- He won't let us on board.

434
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:34,399
- Oh, dear.
- Ridiculous.

435
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,715
In all the time
I've worked here--

436
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,230
- If you please,
Monsieur Mitchell.

437
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:38,906
Will you excuse us, Constable?

438
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,542
One moment, if you please.

439
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:43,374
I have a question,
if you would be so good.

440
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:47,043
Did either of you
during the flight see a wasp?

441
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,679
- A sort of squashed wasp,
yes, sir,

442
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,033
in the young Frenchman's saucer
when I gave him more coffee.

443
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:52,947
- But did you see
the wasp alive?

444
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:57,096
Did either of you see the wasp
flying around the cabin?

445
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,173
- No.

446
00:31:58,453 --> 00:31:59,210
No, I can't say I did.

447
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,726
- Nor did I.

448
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,840
But surely it was the dart
that killed the poor woman.

449
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,156
Hasn't that been established?

450
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,792
- Almost certainly,
yes, mademoiselle.

451
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:07,329
- Then why--

452
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:08,844
- Mademoiselle Grey,

453
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,079
when was the last time you saw
to be alive Madame Giselle?

454
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:13,432
- Well, I suppose

455
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,985
when I collected up the plates
after the meal.

456
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,820
- Yes, she was alive
when I poured her coffee.

457
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,535
A few minutes later
that would be.

458
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:22,048
- Merci.

459
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,162
Merci bien.

460
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,598
Just one more question.

461
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,991
Madame Giselle, had she ever
flown with you before?

462
00:32:28,272 --> 00:32:29,308
- I'd never seen her.

463
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:32,180
But I've only been working here
a few weeks.

464
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,377
- Ah, yes, of course.

465
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:34,414
And you, monsieur?

466
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:36,050
- Well, yes,
as a matter of fact,

467
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,004
she flew with us quite often.

468
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:40,198
She usually went in
the first plane in the morning,

469
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:41,475
the 9:00.

470
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:42,950
This one sometimes gets busy,

471
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,865
but there's always room
in the 9:00.

472
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:46,341
- They've found something,
Poirot.

473
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,734
You better come along with me.

474
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:51,327
- Thank you very much.

475
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:00,541
- A wooden pipe, Poirot.

476
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,815
- So I see, Chief Inspector.

477
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:06,645
- Just what I was looking for.

478
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:10,195
All we need to know now
is how it got here.

479
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:13,865
- You see the markings?

480
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:16,378
I think you will find...

481
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:19,290
that it is South American.

482
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,402
Just as is the dart.

483
00:33:31,936 --> 00:33:33,052
- What's that you've got?

484
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:35,844
- I do not know.

485
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:41,309
But I am sure
all will become clear.

486
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:46,973
The wooden tube
is rather beautiful,

487
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:48,609
is it not, Chief Inspector?

488
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,603
- Quite frankly, Poirot,
I don't much care

489
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:52,798
whether it's beautiful
or South American.

490
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:54,632
At the moment,
I'd just like to know

491
00:33:54,912 --> 00:33:57,305
who was sitting here.

492
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,456
- I was sitting here,
Chief Inspector.

493
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:02,570
- Oh.

494
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:06,998
Oh, well, that puts a different
complexion on it, I suppose.

495
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,195
- Mais non.

496
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:11,146
Not at all.

497
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:13,101
Check it for the fingerprints,
if you please.

498
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:15,654
I insist.

499
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,369
I understand it is your duty

500
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:18,925
as a policeman of Scotland Yard

501
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:20,760
to regard everyone as guilty

502
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,395
until he is proven
to be innocent.

503
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:23,433
- No, no, really--

504
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:25,028
- And I tell you,
Chief Inspector,

505
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:28,220
I regard it as my duty
to clear my name

506
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,610
of this inexcusable slur
as soon as possible.

507
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,460
- Stephen?
I had to talk to you.

508
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,973
I must warn you,
something awful's happened.

509
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:47,726
There's been a murder.

510
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,081
Yes, on the plane.

511
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:50,677
That Giselle woman.

512
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:06,035
- Oui, Inspecteur.

513
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:13,853
- Ouvrez la porte!
Police!

514
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,927
Ouvrez-nous tout de suite.

515
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:26,099
Allez... ouvrez!
Ouvrez!

516
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,447
Ouvrez la porte!

517
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,641
Ouvrez-nous tout de suite!

518
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:39,143
Inspecteur Fournier, Sûreté.

519
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:40,818
- Enchantée, Inspecteur.

520
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:02,399
- I demand to speak
to the person in charge.

521
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,476
- Sorry, madame--

522
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:05,470
- Don't "madame" me.

523
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:06,787
Do you know who I am?

524
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:08,901
- What's going on?

525
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,496
- It really doesn't make
any difference.

526
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:11,813
- What did you say?
- I've strict--

527
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:13,608
- I think you will discover,
Chief Inspector,

528
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:14,884
that it is Lady Horbury.

529
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,640
- Person in charge.
- So you say.

530
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,072
But I'm afraid I have
strict instructions.

531
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:20,149
Look, I've told you, madame.

532
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:22,863
- What seems to be the problem,
Constable?

533
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:24,019
- This lady--

534
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,415
- Are you
the senior policeman here?

535
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:26,572
- Chief Inspector Japp, yes.

536
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,146
- I'd like to talk to you
on your own.

537
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:31,582
I wish to complain.

538
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:33,577
- If you just go back
to the lounge, please, madame,

539
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:35,411
I shall be questioning
everyone shortly.

540
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,805
- Uh, Chief Inspector Japp,

541
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:41,634
I think it would be better
to talk to Lady Horbury now.

542
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:44,187
She was sitting in the seat
directly in front of mine.

543
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,940
- Oh, was she?
- Oui.

544
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,014
- Right.

545
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,889
All right, Constable.

546
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,071
Have you ever seen this before,
Lady Horbury?

547
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:59,345
- No, certainly not.
Why?

548
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:02,138
- Lady Horbury, at any time
during the flight,

549
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,491
did you see anyone move
to the rear of the plane?

550
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:05,847
- What's it got to do with you?

551
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:09,158
- Just answer the question,
please.

552
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:13,945
- No.

553
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:15,182
I was sitting facing the front.

554
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,336
How could I?
I never left my seat.

555
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:19,530
- But I am thinking
about the last half hour

556
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,607
in particular.

557
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,561
Did you not notice
anyone at all?

558
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,197
- No.

559
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,031
Well, apart from the steward
and stewardess.

560
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,226
They were clearing the tables
and then serving coffee.

561
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,339
They passed by a few times.

562
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,576
- Did you see a wasp?

563
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:34,130
- A wasp?
No.

564
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:35,725
- And did you know
the murdered woman,

565
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,639
Lady Horbury?

566
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,113
- N-no.

567
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,065
No, I'd never seen her before.

568
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:55,311
- Just when I thought
we were getting somewhere.

569
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,704
- There is something that
troubles you, Chief Inspector?

570
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,619
- I've just heard from Fournier.

571
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,453
They've only just
dragged themselves round

572
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,491
to Giselle's house.

573
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:03,727
By the time they got there,

574
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:06,161
her blasted maid had destroyed
all her papers.

575
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,876
- Ah.

576
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:09,352
Then perhaps it was
their lunchtime

577
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:11,107
when you informed them
what happened.

578
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:13,819
- I beg your pardon.

579
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,014
- Well, it is very important
in France, the lunchtime,

580
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,008
but for the eating
and afterwards, the sleeping,

581
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:19,484
not for the catching
of the criminals

582
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,957
and the collecting
of the evidence.

583
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:25,228
Why do you need these papers,
Chief Inspector?

584
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:27,701
- Because I think Lady Horbury
knew Giselle.

585
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:29,336
I could see it in her eyes.

586
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:31,331
But I need proof.

587
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:32,807
- Well, I told them
it's a waste of time

588
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,003
looking through our luggage.

589
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:35,320
- Just because
they've let us go,

590
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,115
it doesn't mean
they don't suspect one of us.

591
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:38,431
- Exactly, all it means is

592
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:41,822
they couldn't find the evidence
to keep us here.

593
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:43,059
- Excuse me, mademoiselle,

594
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,053
that gentleman over there
with the mustaches,

595
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,449
can you tell me who he is?

596
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,643
- Yes.
That's Hercule Poirot.

597
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:51,276
He's the famous detective.

598
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:07,989
- Tell me, did either of you see
anyone pass by Madame Giselle

599
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,107
during the flight?

600
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,502
- Yes, I did.

601
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:11,899
I was handing out the meals.

602
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,571
I saw Mr. Clancy
walk right by her.

603
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,406
He was carrying a book.

604
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,438
I assume he'd taken it
from his bag or coat.

605
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:21,432
He went straight back
to his seat with it.

606
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:24,943
- Did he pause as he walked by?

607
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,576
Or do anything
in any way unusual?

608
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:29,132
- I don't think so.

609
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,006
But I wasn't really
concentrating on him.

610
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,040
I'm still not used to the work.

611
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:35,194
I was terrified
of dropping the food.

612
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,107
- I see.

613
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,659
And did either of you
see anyone else get up?

614
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,494
- No.

615
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,249
- Well, actually,
I got up myself,

616
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,204
but only to go to the toilet.

617
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,680
- Which is at the other end
of the cabin.

618
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,595
- Yeah.

619
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,869
- Ah.

620
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,024
Au revoir, Monsieur Gale.

621
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:10,576
- Monsieur Poirot.

622
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:15,683
- What an impressive house.

623
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:17,119
- Yes.

624
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:18,555
I wish I could say it was mine,

625
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,910
but I'm afraid it's my uncle's.

626
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:24,697
The surgery's here too.
We both work here.

627
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:28,607
- Well, good-bye.
- Ah, good-bye.

628
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,082
I was wondering,

629
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:31,599
are you possibly free
for dinner,

630
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:32,835
perhaps tomorrow night?

631
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:33,952
- Goodness.

632
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,585
Well, it's--how lovely.
Yes.

633
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:37,621
- Yes?
Good.

634
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,576
I'll telephone you tomorrow.

635
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:56,689
- You are thinking
of Monsieur Gale, mademoiselle?

636
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,405
- No, actually.

637
00:40:58,684 --> 00:40:59,760
I was thinking of Mr. Dupont.

638
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,431
- Ah, the archaeologist.

639
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,986
Why is it that you think of him?

640
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:08,017
- Well, because he came up
and asked me who you were.

641
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,135
- Mm.

642
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:11,449
- It was a bit odd.
That's all.

643
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:17,112
- And so you see, to Poirot,
nobody is above suspicion.

644
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:18,189
- Well, I hope you don't think

645
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,025
either of them
killed the poor woman.

646
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:24,213
- En effet, mademoiselle,
either could have done it.

647
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:26,327
Merci.

648
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:28,840
Monsieur Gale, because he could
have had access to the poison.

649
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,673
He would have known the doctors.
For him, it would be easy.

650
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:32,709
And Monsieur Dupont,

651
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,225
because he travels
around the world

652
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,981
visiting the places exotiques,

653
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,813
he could have purchased
the poison and the pipes.

654
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:40,887
And of course,
he killed the wasp.

655
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,281
- But I thought Madame Giselle
was killed with the dart.

656
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,717
- Yes, you are right,
mademoiselle.

657
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:46,471
The wasp is
not so much interesting

658
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,307
as suggestive, I think.

659
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,461
Ah.

660
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,974
Mademoiselle Grey,

661
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:56,483
would you be kind enough
to help me?

662
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,899
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

663
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:27,358
- Ah.

664
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,467
Thank you, mademoiselle.

665
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,806
Good evening.

666
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,003
- Monsieur Poirot?

667
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:10,080
- Yes.

668
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,436
I'm Lord Horbury.

669
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,072
- Ah, yes.

670
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:14,947
Please.

671
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:26,115
- Thank you.

672
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:32,737
You see, my wife, well,

673
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:37,604
in many ways, she's just
not suited to the life I lead.

674
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:39,638
It's a bit of a washout,
really, our marriage.

675
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,633
It's entirely my fault.

676
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:43,348
I freely admit that.

677
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:45,104
I fell for her, you see.

678
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:47,377
Hook, line, and sinker.

679
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:49,252
Well, she was an actress.

680
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:50,648
You know what actresses
are like.

681
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,002
- No.

682
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:54,996
What are actresses like,
Lord Horbury?

683
00:43:55,276 --> 00:43:56,911
- Well, um,

684
00:43:57,191 --> 00:44:00,421
all things to all men,
in my experience.

685
00:44:00,701 --> 00:44:02,974
I mean, she'd play the
country lady but to perfection,

686
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:05,048
until she got bored
with the part.

687
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:07,242
- So why do you come to me now,
Lord Horbury?

688
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,914
- Well, we've had the police
round already.

689
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:12,109
I don't know how they found out.

690
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,861
But they discovered
she knew the murdered woman.

691
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:16,975
- And do you believe
that this could have been

692
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,209
sufficient justification
for her to kill her?

693
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,962
- No.

694
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:24,753
As I said,
we don't get on.

695
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:27,426
We don't get on at all.

696
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,538
But, God, I know
what she's capable of.

697
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,572
And she's not capable of murder.

698
00:44:32,852 --> 00:44:33,929
Never.

699
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,693
- We've been sitting here
watching his house

700
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:48,208
for an hour and a half.

701
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,644
He's never going to turn up.

702
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:51,999
- Monsieur Clancy will turn up
eventually, mademoiselle.

703
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:53,474
Have no fear.

704
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,606
- There he is.

705
00:45:10,587 --> 00:45:12,781
- Do not forget the shorthand,
mademoiselle.

706
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,576
- But I told you
I don't do shorthand.

707
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:17,408
- Neither, I am sure,
does Monsieur Clancy.

708
00:45:17,688 --> 00:45:19,762
Just make the little squiggles
with confidence.

709
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,835
It will unnerve him.

710
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:43,935
Monsieur Clancy, I confess,
I am at a loss.

711
00:45:44,214 --> 00:45:47,086
I tried to deduce who is
the murderer of Madame Giselle,

712
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,280
but there are several suspects.

713
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,551
The little gray cells,
never do they let me down,

714
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:53,667
but in this case...

715
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:58,255
And so in despair,
I come to you.

716
00:45:58,536 --> 00:45:59,571
- Why me?

717
00:45:59,852 --> 00:46:01,885
- Because, Monsieur Clancy,
I'm a great admirer

718
00:46:02,165 --> 00:46:04,039
of your detective
Monsieur Wilbraham Rice.

719
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,031
Such logic,
such a mind!

720
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,065
Indeed, Monsieur Clancy,

721
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:14,769
I have read everything
that you have written.

722
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,519
Now, Mademoiselle Grey here
has agreed to assist me.

723
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:20,913
I know that you will have
some theory of your own

724
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:22,468
about who committed the murder.

725
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:24,343
If you would be so good
to tell it,

726
00:46:24,623 --> 00:46:26,576
then Mademoiselle Grey
will take it down

727
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:28,970
so that I may absorb it later.

728
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:32,919
- I'm sorry.
No, it's impossible.

729
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:35,475
- Oh, come, come, come,
monsieur.

730
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:36,911
You are too modest.

731
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:39,106
- I'm useless
at this sort of thing.

732
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:40,781
Wilbraham does it, you see.

733
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:43,533
He works it all out for me.

734
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:45,727
He's quite brilliant.

735
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:48,120
He was helping me only just now
when I was out.

736
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:50,913
We were retracing the steps
of a murder.

737
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:52,509
Terrible stabbing.

738
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:55,659
- Monsieur Clancy, I am talking
about a real murder,

739
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,207
and one of the chief suspects
is yourself.

740
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,843
Oh, yes.

741
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:03,358
You had the opportunity,

742
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,912
and you were observed
to pass by Madame Giselle

743
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:08,664
during the flight.

744
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:10,498
- I deny it.

745
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:17,200
- But I saw you, Mr. Clancy.

746
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,990
You were carrying a book.

747
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:22,944
- Oh, yes, of course.

748
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:27,172
My Bradshaw.

749
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:29,207
It gives the railway times.

750
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:30,882
Wilbraham told me
to go and get it

751
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,076
to check the villain's alibi.

752
00:47:33,356 --> 00:47:34,592
He was absolutely right.

753
00:47:34,872 --> 00:47:35,829
Really cracked it.

754
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:38,062
I'd never have noticed it
myself.

755
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,966
- Perhaps Monsieur Rice
could solve another puzzle.

756
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:46,758
You told to me that you knew
of the South American Indians

757
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:47,915
and their poison darts

758
00:47:48,195 --> 00:47:50,269
because of research
for one of your books.

759
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:52,183
Unfortunately, Monsieur Clancy,

760
00:47:52,464 --> 00:47:53,619
there is no mention
of this subject

761
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,976
in any of your books.

762
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:57,369
But to my surprise,

763
00:47:57,649 --> 00:48:00,680
what do I see on your shelf?

764
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,661
But this.

765
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:20,385
- With the powers invested in me
by the registrar of Paris,

766
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,257
I now declare you man and wife.

767
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:38,335
- Je dois aller à la police.
C'est très important.

768
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,487
Très vite.

769
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,357
- Entrez!

770
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:54,332
- Bonjour.

771
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,807
- Do you speak English?

772
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:58,400
- I do.
Why?

773
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,474
- You're in charge
of the Giselle case?

774
00:49:00,755 --> 00:49:02,908
- Yes.

775
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:04,623
- My name is Anne.

776
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,096
I'm Madame Giselle's daughter.

777
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,048
And I've come to claim
my inheritance.

778
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:34,540
- Ah.

779
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,695
Looking forward to the flight,
Poirot?

780
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,208
Gonna be a bit bumpy
they tell me.

781
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:41,680
Gale-force winds forecast
over the Channel.

782
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:43,595
- I have checked already,
Chief Inspector.

783
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:46,467
The air, it will be
beautifully calm all of the day.

784
00:49:46,748 --> 00:49:49,140
Otherwise, I cancel my flight,
and you go on your own.

785
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,692
- Just a joke.

786
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:55,522
Anyway, I've been talking
to Lord and Lady Horbury again.

787
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:57,437
- I admire your industry,
Chief Inspector.

788
00:49:57,717 --> 00:49:59,032
- And Venetia Kerr.

789
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:01,186
It's quite clear
that Lady Horbury

790
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:02,822
went off gambling
every night in Paris

791
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:04,697
and used to come back
in a terrible state.

792
00:50:04,977 --> 00:50:06,053
But the morning
before they left,

793
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,167
she was particularly desperate.

794
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:11,040
- Which you assume is connected
with Madame Giselle.

795
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:13,433
And so we return to Paris
to see what else we can find

796
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:15,348
to finally incriminate
the Lady Horbury.

797
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:17,861
- Well, yes, that's what
we're going for, isn't it?

798
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,656
Or have you got
a completely different theory

799
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:22,129
you're not telling me about?

800
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:23,165
- I am reaching

801
00:50:23,406 --> 00:50:26,995
certain conclusions,
Chief Inspector.

802
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,944
But conclusions which do not yet
fit together, unfortunately.

803
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:34,973
First, I conclude that the wasp
is of vital importance.

804
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,608
- Yes, but she wasn't killed
by the wasp.

805
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:38,523
Forensic have already
confirmed that.

806
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:40,398
- And secondly,
the sudden appearance

807
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:43,270
of the daughter
of Madame Giselle,

808
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,783
who we assume will inherit
the money of her mother.

809
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:48,456
- Unless they find a will
that says differently.

810
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:51,328
- Of course it is possible

811
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:53,761
that the daughter might be
an imposter.

812
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:56,035
Or perhaps Madame Giselle
did not even have a daughter.

813
00:50:56,315 --> 00:50:57,910
- Sir?
- Ah.

814
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,625
- Would you care to order?

815
00:50:59,905 --> 00:51:01,699
- Full English, please.

816
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:45,498
- If you please, madame,

817
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:49,248
may I have the use of your seat
just for one moment?

818
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:55,191
Thank you.

819
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:01,776
Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

820
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,868
- Thank you.

821
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:22,120
- What are you doing?

822
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,157
- Pardon?

823
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:24,952
- Where'd you get that?

824
00:52:25,232 --> 00:52:27,186
- This?

825
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:28,543
From Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

826
00:52:28,822 --> 00:52:31,574
It was in his house.

827
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,885
- That's evidence, Poirot.

828
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,153
- Alors, Chief Inspector,
may I present it to you?

829
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:43,860
For myself, I have
no further use of it.

830
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:51,479
- I hope you're
not going to make

831
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:54,750
an exhibition of yourself here
like you did on that plane.

832
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:00,016
- But my experiments were
very useful, Chief Inspector.

833
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:04,403
They showed how dangerous
a woman is Lady Horbury.

834
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:06,916
- Well, exactly.

835
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:09,868
- Et bien...

836
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,782
to be able to blow
the poison dart

837
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,176
from one end of the cabin
to the other?

838
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:17,208
First, she must have
a lot of puff.

839
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:19,321
Secondly...

840
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:23,510
her aim must be as good
as that of Fred Perry himself.

841
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,305
And finally,

842
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:27,220
she must have been able
to become invisible

843
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,288
so that no one on the plane
saw her do it.

844
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:35,836
I apologize, mon ami.

845
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:39,506
Poirot has gone too far?

846
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:41,500
- I'm surprised at you, Poirot,

847
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:43,655
you of all people.

848
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,290
I mean, what we're talking
about here

849
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,843
is the psychological moment,
surely.

850
00:53:48,123 --> 00:53:49,478
Whoever murdered Giselle,

851
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,151
whether it was Lady Horbury
or even Daniel Clancy,

852
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:54,983
clearly, they chose just
the psychological moment

853
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:56,459
when no one was looking,

854
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,171
so they could shoot the dart
from wherever they wanted.

855
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:07,030
- Psychology.

856
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,024
You are right, Chief Inspector.

857
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:12,096
There must have been
the reason psychological

858
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:14,968
why no one on the plane
saw the murderer.

859
00:54:15,248 --> 00:54:16,604
That is what we must discover.

860
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:20,433
But first, we must talk
to the daughter.

861
00:54:20,713 --> 00:54:23,265
If the daughter is
what she really is.

862
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:29,248
- What do you mean she's gone?

863
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:31,602
- She arranged
to return here today

864
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:34,275
where I agreed we would take
further particulars.

865
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:38,104
She was in such a hurry before,
but she did not return.

866
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:39,779
- Well, let's go and find her,
Fournier.

867
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,692
How about that for a plan?

868
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:44,087
- That is the problem, you see.

869
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,641
I do not know where.

870
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,393
- You mean you didn't take
her address?

871
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:50,949
- No.

872
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:54,099
After all, she came to claim
her inheritance,

873
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,932
a very large amount of money
probably.

874
00:54:57,212 --> 00:55:00,522
Why should she not return?

875
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:02,476
- Chief Inspector,
I would like it

876
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,391
that you stay and work
with Inspector Fournier,

877
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:05,429
if you please.

878
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,665
- Ha!

879
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:08,739
- Look, please do not be
difficult, Chief Inspector.

880
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,494
We are in great need of the help
of the Sûreté.

881
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,409
- We just had their help.
Look where it's got us.

882
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:14,524
- Please, Chief Inspector, look.

883
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:16,797
You remember that I remove
from the wooden tube

884
00:55:17,077 --> 00:55:18,114
a tiny piece of paper.

885
00:55:18,393 --> 00:55:21,345
I have been studying it.
Observe it, if you please.

886
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:26,290
It has on it the letter F,

887
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:28,365
which I believe
stands for "francs."

888
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:31,077
It is, I think, the remains
of a price ticket

889
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:32,513
which has been torn off.

890
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:35,466
Therefore, the wooden tube,
it was purchased from a shop,

891
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:37,061
in Paris probably.

892
00:55:37,341 --> 00:55:39,774
- I thought it came from
the South American Indians.

893
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:41,289
- No.

894
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,965
But now we have the need
to discover

895
00:55:43,245 --> 00:55:44,520
where then is this shop?

896
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,275
And Inspector Fournier
and his men

897
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:48,429
will help you to find it.

898
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,946
- And what are you going to do?

899
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:54,094
- First, I must rest
the little gray cells.

900
00:55:54,374 --> 00:55:57,205
And then I pursue the matter
of the disappearing daughter.

901
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,073
- On demande Madame de la Roche.

902
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,786
Paging Madame de la Roche.

903
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:22,376
On demande Madame de la Roche.

904
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:26,245
Paging Madame de la Roche.

905
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:28,439
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

906
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,425
Un homme a réservé
une chambre pour moi.

907
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:35,619
Il s'appelle Poirot.

908
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:36,975
- Ah, yes, of course.

909
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:38,491
Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

910
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,207
And you are Miss Grey.

911
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:42,121
- Yes.
Thank you.

912
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:44,156
- How do you do, Miss Grey?

913
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:47,586
- How do you do?
Mr. Dupont.

914
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,341
What a surprise.

915
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:50,896
Where are we going?

916
00:56:51,177 --> 00:56:52,931
- I want to show you
some of the remarkable things

917
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:55,324
that archaeologists have in
the past unearthed, Miss Grey.

918
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:56,960
- Well, wait a minute.
This is ridiculous.

919
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,794
How did you know
where to find me, Mr. Dupont?

920
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:00,630
- It was easy.
I telephoned the airline.

921
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,986
I said that I was your brother,

922
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:03,741
that I urgently needed
to contact you.

923
00:57:04,022 --> 00:57:04,818
- But why?

924
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,850
- Because I need your help.

925
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:21,213
- Have you ever dug up
anything like this?

926
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:22,848
- Not personally, no.

927
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:24,005
Not yet.

928
00:57:24,285 --> 00:57:26,159
My father,
he was the expert.

929
00:57:26,439 --> 00:57:29,669
He devoted his life to the study
of equatorial Africa.

930
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,464
Last year, he died.

931
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:33,259
So this year,
I plan an expedition there

932
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,576
to continue his work.

933
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:35,613
- What a good idea.

934
00:57:35,893 --> 00:57:38,764
- Unfortunately,
I have no money.

935
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:41,516
I need money to fund
the expedition.

936
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:43,112
I look for private donations,

937
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,384
but the average person,
it is terrible.

938
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,495
They care nothing
about primitive culture.

939
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:51,688
- Well, I hope you don't think
I've got any money.

940
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:52,885
I wish I had.

941
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:55,558
- No, no, it is not you,
Mademoiselle Grey.

942
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,393
It is the gentleman
with the mustaches,

943
00:57:57,673 --> 00:57:58,949
Monsieur Poirot.

944
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:02,738
He is a man of style
and culture.

945
00:58:03,018 --> 00:58:05,450
He has money, I think.

946
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:06,926
You know him well?

947
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:09,519
- Not well, no.

948
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:10,676
No, hardly at all.

949
00:58:10,956 --> 00:58:12,192
- Ah.

950
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,987
How unfortunate.

951
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:18,255
I wish to ask if you
would consider a small donation.

952
00:58:20,649 --> 00:58:21,646
- Poirot?

953
00:58:21,926 --> 00:58:23,601
Give money to the digging up
of Africa?

954
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,595
Mon Dieu.

955
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:28,187
Mm, perhaps that is not
such a bad idea.

956
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:32,057
Voilà.
We are here.

957
00:58:32,337 --> 00:58:34,051
I will need your advice,
mademoiselle.

958
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:35,328
- Why?
How can I help?

959
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:37,961
- You are a daughter,
are you not?

960
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,876
We hear that Madame Giselle
had a daughter,

961
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:43,107
but perhaps this is wrong.

962
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:50,965
- This is an eerie place.

963
00:58:51,245 --> 00:58:54,315
So cold and unfriendly.

964
00:58:54,596 --> 00:58:56,510
Not what I would consider
a home.

965
00:58:56,789 --> 00:59:00,019
I mean, there's nothing
personal in it.

966
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,613
Nothing at all.

967
00:59:02,892 --> 00:59:05,404
- Mm, you are right.

968
00:59:05,685 --> 00:59:08,237
S'il vous plaît?

969
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:11,866
There are no souvenirs,
no photographs,

970
00:59:12,147 --> 00:59:16,534
no memories.

971
00:59:16,814 --> 00:59:19,247
Est-ce que Madame Giselle
avait de la famille, Elise?

972
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:21,042
- Non, monsieur.

973
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,597
Ses parents sont morts.

974
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:23,953
- Morts?

975
00:59:24,234 --> 00:59:26,387
What's she saying?
That someone's dead?

976
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:29,218
- Her mistress had no family.

977
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,530
Both her parents are dead.

978
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,604
Avaît-elle des enfants?

979
00:59:34,884 --> 00:59:37,037
- Non, aucun.

980
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:39,031
- And there are no children?

981
00:59:39,312 --> 00:59:41,385
- No.

982
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,374
Comme c'est curieux, Elise.

983
00:59:45,654 --> 00:59:47,489
Une femme dont le nom
est Anne Giselle

984
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:51,038
vient de refaire surface.

985
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:54,389
- Anne?

986
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:56,902
Anne Giselle a refait surface?

987
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:58,498
- She knows the name.

988
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:02,687
So Anne Giselle does exist.

989
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,439
- Est-ce que Anne est la fille
de madame Giselle?

990
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:09,068
Oui.

991
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:15,530
C'était sa fille.
Illégitime.

992
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:21,275
J' ai dû prendre soin d'elle
pour madame,

993
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,150
jusqu'à ce qu'elle se sépare.

994
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,144
- Oh.

995
01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:30,888
- Il y a vingt-trois ans.
Je ne l'ai jamais revue depuis.

996
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,271
- The baby of Madame Giselle
was illegitimate

997
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,943
so that Elise
had to take care of her.

998
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,990
- What did she say,
something about 23 years ago?

999
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:47,985
- It is 23 years
that her mistress

1000
01:00:48,265 --> 01:00:50,059
took the baby away from Elise,

1001
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,012
and she has not seen her since.

1002
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,239
- Attendez.

1003
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:04,659
Voilà.

1004
01:01:04,939 --> 01:01:09,287
- Ah.
Merci.

1005
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,395
- Ah, Poirot.

1006
01:01:13,675 --> 01:01:15,589
- Excusez-moi.

1007
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:19,019
- Went and tracked down the shop
that sold the dart.

1008
01:01:19,299 --> 01:01:21,771
81 Porte de Clignancourt.

1009
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:24,245
Greek called Zeropoulos runs it.

1010
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:25,561
- Merveilleux.

1011
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:29,829
The efficiency
of the French police, no?

1012
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:30,947
Regarde, mon ami.

1013
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:31,983
- What is it?

1014
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:32,981
- It is a photograph

1015
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:34,377
of the daughter
of Madame Giselle.

1016
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:35,773
Ah, marvelous.

1017
01:01:36,053 --> 01:01:37,369
Be a great help in tracing her,
that will.

1018
01:01:37,649 --> 01:01:41,477
Hold on.
I've got some photos here.

1019
01:01:41,757 --> 01:01:43,512
Excusez-moi.

1020
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:47,461
Have any of these people
ever been here?

1021
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,737
- Uh...

1022
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:52,806
Reconnaisez vous
quelqu'un, Elise?

1023
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:54,880
- Non.

1024
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,593
- Encore une question,
s'il vous plaît?

1025
01:01:57,873 --> 01:01:58,949
Est-ce que vous avez reservé

1026
01:01:59,229 --> 01:02:01,063
la place de Madame Giselle
sur le vol?

1027
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,698
- What are you asking?

1028
01:02:02,979 --> 01:02:04,414
- Oui.

1029
01:02:04,694 --> 01:02:06,169
- Alors, pourquoi
n'a-t-elle pas pris

1030
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:08,164
le vol de 9:00 du matin?

1031
01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:11,833
- Il était plein.
Il n'y avait plus de place.

1032
01:02:12,114 --> 01:02:13,349
- I ask her why Madame Giselle

1033
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,742
did not take the morning flight
as was usual for her.

1034
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,178
- And why didn't she?

1035
01:02:17,459 --> 01:02:19,212
- Because the 9:00 flight,
it was full, évidemment.

1036
01:02:19,493 --> 01:02:20,569
There was no room on it.

1037
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,484
- Well, you can't say fairer
than that, can you?

1038
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:24,319
- Qu'est-ce qui se passé, huh?

1039
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,071
- Ah, excusez-moi, madame.

1040
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:30,940
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ici?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, huh?

1041
01:02:34,212 --> 01:02:35,209
- Do you speak English?

1042
01:02:35,488 --> 01:02:36,246
- Quoi?

1043
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:37,522
Qu'est-ce que vous dites, ah?

1044
01:02:37,802 --> 01:02:38,919
- English?

1045
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:00,818
- Where's Cecily?

1046
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:02,015
- Oh, don't worry.

1047
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:04,567
She's in bed, fast asleep.

1048
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:06,642
- It's been nice being out
in the fresh air like this.

1049
01:03:06,922 --> 01:03:09,114
- Just the two of us you mean?

1050
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:10,790
- Yes.

1051
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,828
Yes, I suppose I do.

1052
01:03:12,107 --> 01:03:13,104
- Well, who knows?

1053
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:16,375
One day, well,
maybe things will be simpler.

1054
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:18,209
- If Cecily did
the decent thing you mean?

1055
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,324
- And what would
the decent thing be

1056
01:03:20,604 --> 01:03:21,999
in your opinion, Venetia?

1057
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:26,028
- Well, if she confessed,
I suppose.

1058
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:28,900
Isn't that what we both want,
really, Stephen?

1059
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:47,968
- Japp here.

1060
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:51,398
Yes, I know it's crackly.
I'm talking from France.

1061
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:54,071
I want you to find
Lady Cecily Horbury at once.

1062
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:58,179
H-O-R,
B for Bertie,

1063
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,410
U-R-Y.

1064
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,726
Belgravia.

1065
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:06,715
Oh, yes, another place,
big house in Suffolk.

1066
01:04:06,996 --> 01:04:10,385
Well, look it up in the file.

1067
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:12,859
And don't lose sight of her.

1068
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:14,693
What?

1069
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,090
Yes!

1070
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:20,039
And ring me back as soon as
you've traced her.

1071
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:22,672
Morning, Fournier.

1072
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:24,745
Sit down.

1073
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:30,211
So what have you
found out for me?

1074
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,408
- I've been to see

1075
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:33,840
Madame Giselle's lawyer,
Inspector.

1076
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,075
- Chief Inspector.

1077
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,468
- Uh, Chief Inspector.

1078
01:04:38,748 --> 01:04:40,941
I've seen the will,
and it is true.

1079
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:43,933
Madame Giselle left
her daughter, Anne Giselle,

1080
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,328
all her money,

1081
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:47,482
except for a small amount
for the maid,

1082
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:49,158
Elise Grandier.

1083
01:04:49,438 --> 01:04:51,871
- I see.

1084
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,786
Thank you, Fournier.

1085
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:05,274
- That is correct.

1086
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,189
The 9:00 flight was full,

1087
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:09,262
so I booked Madame Giselle
on the midday flight.

1088
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:10,698
- How strange.

1089
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:12,773
- Why?
What's strange about it?

1090
01:05:13,053 --> 01:05:14,927
Flights are often booked up
well in advance.

1091
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,600
- But not this one, monsieur.

1092
01:05:17,879 --> 01:05:19,873
- What do you mean?

1093
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:23,503
- I'm an air stewardess.

1094
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:26,295
A colleague of mine was
on the 9:00 flight.

1095
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:28,370
She told me
it was virtually empty.

1096
01:05:33,357 --> 01:05:36,707
- So perhaps you can now tell me
the truth, monsieur.

1097
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:38,222
- Well, it--

1098
01:05:40,657 --> 01:05:42,211
Very well.

1099
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:44,247
A man came in.

1100
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:45,803
He gave me 4,000 francs

1101
01:05:46,084 --> 01:05:47,837
to tell her the early plane
was full.

1102
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:50,470
There didn't seem to be
any harm in it.

1103
01:05:50,751 --> 01:05:53,302
I didn't know
she was going to be murdered.

1104
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:56,135
- Describe this man,
s'il vous plaît.

1105
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:59,246
He was an American,

1106
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,001
tall, young,

1107
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:04,392
with a goatee beard
and glasses.

1108
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:07,902
- Thank you.

1109
01:06:08,182 --> 01:06:09,258
- Ah, yes.

1110
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:11,572
With glasses
and a hat.

1111
01:06:11,852 --> 01:06:15,321
And he chewed gum
like all Americans.

1112
01:06:15,602 --> 01:06:16,877
And his French accent,

1113
01:06:17,157 --> 01:06:18,552
it was terrible.

1114
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,507
- Of course.
Bon.

1115
01:06:20,788 --> 01:06:21,864
- Look.

1116
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:25,414
I will show you the tray
where I keep the wooden pipes.

1117
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:28,006
The junk tray I call it.

1118
01:06:28,287 --> 01:06:32,194
I keep it for all the Americans.

1119
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:33,790
No, no, no, no.

1120
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:35,585
I bring it to you.

1121
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:38,058
Enjoy the sun.

1122
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:39,415
- Merci.

1123
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,712
- But there wasn't
an American on board.

1124
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:50,185
So where'd he come from?

1125
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:51,621
- Mademoiselle,

1126
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:55,012
you have helped me
very, very much.

1127
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:56,089
I thank you.

1128
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:57,405
- Well, I haven't done much.

1129
01:06:57,685 --> 01:06:59,838
- Oh, yes, already you are like
a true professional.

1130
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:01,753
With the young man
at airline office,

1131
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:05,462
you played your role
but to perfection.

1132
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:09,651
Ah!
The wooden tube.

1133
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:10,728
May I?

1134
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:13,999
- Oui, oui.

1135
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,754
- C'est jolie, n'est-ce pas?

1136
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:20,780
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est?

1137
01:07:23,813 --> 01:07:24,810
Ah.

1138
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:30,593
The little pieces of silk,
such workmanship.

1139
01:07:30,873 --> 01:07:33,585
What else do you observe,
mademoiselle?

1140
01:07:33,865 --> 01:07:35,021
- Well, the silk is red.

1141
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,694
I thought the dart
that killed Madame Giselle

1142
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:39,010
had black and yellow on it.

1143
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,483
- But you see, the murderer,

1144
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:44,754
he replaced the red silk
with the black and yellow.

1145
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:49,342
You seem to be in a hurry,
mademoiselle.

1146
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:51,017
- Oh, not really.

1147
01:07:51,297 --> 01:07:53,928
Well, Norman--Mr. Gale--
said he might call.

1148
01:07:54,209 --> 01:07:55,883
He thought he might come over
for a couple of days.

1149
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:57,120
- I see.

1150
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,314
Um, Mademoiselle Grey,
I've been thinking.

1151
01:07:59,594 --> 01:08:01,268
I have been thinking very hard.

1152
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:02,984
I wish that you say
to Monsieur Dupont

1153
01:08:03,264 --> 01:08:04,619
that Poirot is very happy
to give to him

1154
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,571
for his expedition
the sum of £500.

1155
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:08,927
- £500?

1156
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,044
- Oui.

1157
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:11,759
- That's extremely kind.

1158
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:12,876
- But of course.

1159
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:18,939
- À la préfecture de police,
s'il vous plaît.

1160
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,037
- What if that woman
Fournier let slip

1161
01:08:27,317 --> 01:08:28,872
is not the real daughter,
Poirot?

1162
01:08:29,152 --> 01:08:30,269
- Who else do we know

1163
01:08:30,548 --> 01:08:31,983
who is of an age
that would be correct

1164
01:08:32,264 --> 01:08:33,500
for the daughter
of Madame Giselle?

1165
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:34,616
I tell you.

1166
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:36,331
We know three women:

1167
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,004
the honorable Venetia Kerr,
Mademoiselle Jane Grey,

1168
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:40,599
and the Lady Horbury.

1169
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,195
All three were on the airplane.

1170
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:43,871
- Well, I'd still plug
for Lady Horbury.

1171
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:45,108
- But why, Chief Inspector?

1172
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:46,264
- Well, for one thing,

1173
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:47,820
because that concierge
at Giselle's

1174
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,814
finally admitted
that she recognized her.

1175
01:08:50,094 --> 01:08:50,971
- She told you this?

1176
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:52,566
- Said she'd been there
several times.

1177
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:55,319
The last time, she stormed out,
slamming the door behind her.

1178
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,310
- You discovered all this while
knowing virtually no French?

1179
01:08:58,591 --> 01:09:00,146
Chief Inspector,
you're a miracle.

1180
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:02,060
- Well, a bit of ingenuity,

1181
01:09:02,341 --> 01:09:05,012
expressive hand gestures,
that sort of thing.

1182
01:09:08,205 --> 01:09:09,001
- Thank you.

1183
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:11,833
We make progress, Fournier.

1184
01:09:12,113 --> 01:09:13,230
Chief Inspector Japp believes

1185
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:15,703
that Lady Horbury
committed the murder.

1186
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:17,258
Whereas I,
I have discovered

1187
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:20,011
that the purchaser
of the poison dart was a man.

1188
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:21,047
- It can't have been.

1189
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:22,564
- Mais oui.
An American.

1190
01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:24,279
Or he seems to be.

1191
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,515
He chews gum.

1192
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:27,151
He wears American spectacles

1193
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:30,262
and speaks with a most terrible
French accent.

1194
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,898
But it is easy to be
an American in Paris,

1195
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:33,214
n'est-ce pas, Fournier?

1196
01:09:33,494 --> 01:09:34,570
- Mais oui, certainement.

1197
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:36,805
- So I suggest that he is
a stage American.

1198
01:09:37,084 --> 01:09:39,596
- You mean it was a disguise?

1199
01:09:39,877 --> 01:09:40,713
- Mm.

1200
01:09:40,994 --> 01:09:43,346
- So it cannot be Lady Horbury.

1201
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:48,412
- Unless she has an accomplice.

1202
01:09:51,126 --> 01:09:52,481
Now, that is possible.

1203
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:57,786
- Wasn't there some gossip
about her in the newspapers?

1204
01:09:58,066 --> 01:09:59,940
About her having
an actor friend.

1205
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,610
- Not in the newspapers
that I read, Chief Inspector.

1206
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:06,405
But you may be right.

1207
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,268
- Japp here.

1208
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:13,784
What?

1209
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:16,018
What do you mean?

1210
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:18,451
Well, where is she?

1211
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:23,757
Wonderful.

1212
01:10:24,037 --> 01:10:25,951
I put a couple of men
onto Lady Horbury.

1213
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,507
But it seems they were too late.

1214
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:28,742
They've missed her.

1215
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:31,176
No one knows where she is.

1216
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:32,692
She's vanished.

1217
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,886
- Oh, dear.

1218
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:39,114
So you have now a lost suspect
too, Chief Inspector?

1219
01:11:03,528 --> 01:11:06,119
- So...now I leave you,
mademoiselle.

1220
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,553
- But aren't you going to say
hello to Norman?

1221
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,308
- Uh...

1222
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:16,052
In such a situation, three is
a considerable crowd, I think.

1223
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:17,926
Excuse me.

1224
01:11:48,723 --> 01:11:50,636
Monsieur Mitchell, is it not?

1225
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:52,989
- Oh, of course.
Mr. Poirot.

1226
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,985
- Oui.
May I, please?

1227
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:56,261
- Please do.

1228
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:58,415
- Thank you.

1229
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:07,869
No more murders I hope,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1230
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:09,145
- No.

1231
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,781
- Bon.

1232
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:23,785
Bon.

1233
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,657
You know it is truly fortunate

1234
01:12:26,937 --> 01:12:28,452
to meet you here,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1235
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:31,044
I have a question to ask you.

1236
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:34,794
When you cleared the table of
Madame Giselle after she died,

1237
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:36,988
did you notice anything unusual?

1238
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:39,860
- No.
No, I don't think so.

1239
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,177
What sort of thing?

1240
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:43,690
- Anything, anything at all.

1241
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:47,519
Think hard, please.
It is very important.

1242
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:49,195
- Well, yes,
there was something.

1243
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:51,388
It's silly, I'm sure,
but, um...

1244
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:53,223
there were two coffee spoons
in her saucer.

1245
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:55,058
It can sometimes happen
when you're in a rush,

1246
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,329
and it's better to lay too much
than too little.

1247
01:12:58,609 --> 01:12:59,845
People can get
terribly irritable

1248
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,837
if everything
isn't exactly right.

1249
01:13:03,116 --> 01:13:06,028
Still, that's not
what you're after.

1250
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:10,415
Au contraire,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1251
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:12,131
Thank you very much.

1252
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:15,402
It is a clue
of the most vital importance.

1253
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:30,799
- It's so nice to be able
to spend time together in Paris.

1254
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,276
- Yes, it is.

1255
01:13:32,555 --> 01:13:34,947
And I'll be fascinated to see
where the old woman lived.

1256
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:38,099
Anyway, why do you think Poirot

1257
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,174
suddenly agreed to give Dupont
the money?

1258
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:42,088
- I don't know.

1259
01:13:42,368 --> 01:13:44,083
Why?
Do you think it's odd?

1260
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:46,117
Do you think he's worked out
some theory?

1261
01:13:46,397 --> 01:13:50,824
- What, that Jean Dupont
murdered Giselle?

1262
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:52,739
Do you believe
he could have done it?

1263
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:53,936
- I don't know.

1264
01:13:54,215 --> 01:13:55,810
He's a bit funny.

1265
01:13:56,091 --> 01:13:58,004
But he seemed quite nice to me.

1266
01:13:58,284 --> 01:13:59,281
- How nice?

1267
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,275
- Not that nice.

1268
01:14:01,555 --> 01:14:03,150
This is her house.

1269
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:07,418
We're being watched.

1270
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,730
- Hello?

1271
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,363
- Oh.

1272
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:30,634
I...was looking
for Inspector Fournier.

1273
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:32,269
- How can we help you,
mademoiselle?

1274
01:14:32,549 --> 01:14:33,386
- Madame.

1275
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:36,457
- Madame.
Pardon.

1276
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,171
- Well, I've come to apologize.

1277
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,162
You see, I came to see
Inspector Fournier...

1278
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:43,957
a little while ago...

1279
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:46,669
about a rather important matter.

1280
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,265
- You're Madame Giselle's
daughter?

1281
01:14:48,545 --> 01:14:50,260
- Yes.

1282
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:53,371
- Please.
Sit down, madame.

1283
01:15:02,148 --> 01:15:03,662
- It's unforgivable, I know.

1284
01:15:03,943 --> 01:15:05,896
But I was
in such a frantic state.

1285
01:15:06,176 --> 01:15:08,848
You see, I only read
about her death

1286
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:10,723
the day I was going
to get married.

1287
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:13,037
The minute the ceremony
was finished,

1288
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:14,911
I hurried over here.

1289
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:17,424
And then I wished I hadn't.

1290
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:19,260
I felt awful
about my poor husband

1291
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:21,014
just waiting for me.

1292
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:23,687
And we couldn't possibly cancel
the honeymoon.

1293
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:26,400
So I just didn't come back.

1294
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,291
- Until now when the honeymoon
has finished?

1295
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:32,007
- Yes.

1296
01:15:32,286 --> 01:15:33,721
- Do you have any idea

1297
01:15:34,002 --> 01:15:36,076
of the trouble you've caused,
Mrs...

1298
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:37,631
- Richards.

1299
01:15:37,911 --> 01:15:39,266
- I think we need a few facts.

1300
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:41,620
For a start, how do we know
you're who you say you are?

1301
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,897
- I thought of that.

1302
01:15:43,176 --> 01:15:45,329
I brought you
my birth certificate.

1303
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:56,778
- Do I not know you, madame?

1304
01:15:57,058 --> 01:16:00,767
There is something about you
that I seem to recognize.

1305
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:03,001
- I don't see how.

1306
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:05,395
I was brought up in Toronto

1307
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:08,665
after my mother abandoned me.

1308
01:16:08,945 --> 01:16:10,062
Do you know Canada?

1309
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:12,056
- Alas, no.

1310
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:15,725
- Were you ever in contact
with your mother, Mrs. Richards?

1311
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:16,763
- Not at all.

1312
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:20,473
She never came to Canada
to see me.

1313
01:16:20,752 --> 01:16:22,388
She never wrote to me.

1314
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:25,140
She obviously didn't care
at all about me.

1315
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:28,051
- And naturally,
you hated her for this.

1316
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:29,408
- I didn't care.

1317
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,043
That's all.

1318
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:33,038
Why should I?

1319
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:36,588
I just hope she's left me
a lot of money.

1320
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:47,398
- Trente-six rouge.

1321
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:52,384
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

1322
01:16:52,665 --> 01:16:53,541
Faites vos jeux.

1323
01:16:53,821 --> 01:16:55,297
- What's the matter?

1324
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:56,972
- Nothing.

1325
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,806
What's money, after all?

1326
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,354
Get me another drink, Raymond.

1327
01:17:10,615 --> 01:17:12,290
- Ah, is this the newspaper

1328
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:13,884
that you tell me about,
Chief Inspector?

1329
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:15,401
The one that reveres the gossip

1330
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,555
of the English upper classes
and their friends?

1331
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:20,267
- Yes, and it's very difficult
to get over here.

1332
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:22,940
- So I see.
The date is yesterday.

1333
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,530
Here, mon ami,
the newspaper of today.

1334
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,242
- Well, thanks.

1335
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:33,790
It's in French, Poirot.

1336
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,545
Struth, there's Lady Horbury.

1337
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:37,739
- She disappears
from her home in England

1338
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:40,611
only to reappear here in Paris
under our very noses.

1339
01:17:40,891 --> 01:17:42,087
"With...

1340
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,238
Let me translate for you,
Chief Inspector.

1341
01:17:45,518 --> 01:17:47,751
"With her traveling companion,

1342
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:52,139
the well-known British actor
Mr. Raymond Barraclough..."

1343
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:54,333
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1344
01:17:54,613 --> 01:17:57,285
Poirot has a plan.

1345
01:18:01,474 --> 01:18:02,350
- Is that all right?

1346
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,388
- No.

1347
01:18:03,668 --> 01:18:05,342
It is terrible.

1348
01:18:05,623 --> 01:18:06,778
Regardez.

1349
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:08,454
- Well, she won't be able
to recognize me.

1350
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:09,850
That's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

1351
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:11,206
- Yes, but I did not intend

1352
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,321
that you should look
like Santa Claus.

1353
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,916
Come, Monsieur Gale,
into the next room

1354
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:18,825
and sit in that chair,
if you please.

1355
01:18:19,105 --> 01:18:20,980
Mademoiselle Grey,
if you would be so kind

1356
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:23,014
as to hold the mirror.

1357
01:18:23,293 --> 01:18:27,202
And, Monsieur,
if you will hold the towel.

1358
01:18:27,482 --> 01:18:29,755
Et bien, do not worry.

1359
01:18:30,035 --> 01:18:35,977
Hercule Poirot will make you
look like a human being again.

1360
01:18:51,735 --> 01:18:52,611
- Lady Horbury.

1361
01:18:52,892 --> 01:18:54,088
Daily Record,
Paris correspondent.

1362
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:55,364
I'm sorry to bother you,

1363
01:18:55,644 --> 01:18:56,960
but we'd really like to do
a piece on you

1364
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,595
for our series,
The English in Paris.

1365
01:18:58,875 --> 01:18:59,633
- No, certainly not.

1366
01:18:59,912 --> 01:19:00,949
- No, really, Lady Horbury.

1367
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:02,783
The photographer will be here
in just a second.

1368
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:05,057
Just a photo of yourself
and Mr. Barraclough here.

1369
01:19:05,338 --> 01:19:06,414
- How dare you.

1370
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:08,049
Get away from us!

1371
01:19:10,244 --> 01:19:12,397
- Now, I really don't think you
should be taking that attitude.

1372
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:16,745
But we'll be here again
tomorrow morning, Lady Horbury.

1373
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:19,617
I can see we've got
an excellent story here already.

1374
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:24,563
- Now look what you've done.

1375
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:25,960
- I'm sorry.

1376
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,234
- Just leave me alone.
You're pathetic.

1377
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:47,340
- Ah, Lady Horbury, bonjour.

1378
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:49,415
You care to join me?

1379
01:19:56,317 --> 01:19:57,672
May I get you something,
a coffee perhaps?

1380
01:19:57,952 --> 01:19:58,709
- No.

1381
01:19:58,989 --> 01:19:59,985
Thank you.
I'm all right.

1382
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,128
- A cigarette perhaps?

1383
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:08,841
- Thank you.

1384
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:24,398
- There is something perhaps
you would like to tell Poirot?

1385
01:20:24,678 --> 01:20:26,034
And then he can help?

1386
01:20:26,313 --> 01:20:28,666
- No, it's nothing, really.

1387
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:35,687
- But I think that is not so.

1388
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:37,322
On the day before the murder,

1389
01:20:37,602 --> 01:20:39,037
your good friend,
Monsieur Barraclough,

1390
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:40,952
he was in Paris?

1391
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:42,228
- Yes.

1392
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:45,779
- And you saw him
while you were in Paris?

1393
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:48,252
And you also saw Madame Giselle,
did you not?

1394
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:52,161
And she refused to release you
from your gambling debts.

1395
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,413
- I didn't know what to do.

1396
01:21:02,693 --> 01:21:05,205
Stephen wouldn't pay them.

1397
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,200
I knew he wouldn't,
not anymore.

1398
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:10,949
They were enormous.

1399
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:13,462
Much more than he imagined.

1400
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:20,163
She threatened me.

1401
01:21:20,444 --> 01:21:23,195
She said she'd tell people
about them...

1402
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:26,625
people in London.

1403
01:21:26,906 --> 01:21:29,937
I'd never have been able
to hold my head up again.

1404
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:33,846
- So the truth is

1405
01:21:34,126 --> 01:21:35,601
that you
and Monsieur Barraclough

1406
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:37,237
were delighted when she died?

1407
01:21:37,516 --> 01:21:39,430
- Yes.

1408
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,664
It was wonderful...

1409
01:21:44,898 --> 01:21:49,086
Almost too wonderful to believe.

1410
01:21:59,658 --> 01:22:01,052
- Ah, Poirot.

1411
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,443
- Chief Inspector.
Mademoiselle.

1412
01:22:15,174 --> 01:22:18,205
- Well, did you find out
what you wanted?

1413
01:22:18,486 --> 01:22:19,442
- Yes.

1414
01:22:19,722 --> 01:22:21,836
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

1415
01:22:30,253 --> 01:22:32,367
- Anyway, I must go.

1416
01:22:32,646 --> 01:22:34,679
Ah, my nail.

1417
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,034
I must file it.

1418
01:22:40,903 --> 01:22:42,179
- What did you say,
mademoiselle?

1419
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,333
- What?

1420
01:22:44,613 --> 01:22:45,928
Oh, my nail.

1421
01:22:46,209 --> 01:22:49,360
It's nothing.
It needs filing.

1422
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:51,832
- Nom de nom de nom.

1423
01:22:52,113 --> 01:22:53,827
Now I understand.

1424
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:55,781
Chief Inspector,

1425
01:22:56,062 --> 01:22:57,018
get a taxi at once.

1426
01:22:57,298 --> 01:22:58,494
Unless I am very much mistaken,

1427
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:02,483
Madame Richards,
she is in great danger.

1428
01:23:36,271 --> 01:23:38,743
- She left about an hour ago
with an American.

1429
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:40,538
She seemed surprised to see him.

1430
01:23:40,818 --> 01:23:42,572
- And where did they go, madame?
Can you tell us that?

1431
01:23:42,853 --> 01:23:43,728
- Oh, yes.

1432
01:23:44,009 --> 01:23:45,404
He ordered a taxi
for the Gare du Nord.

1433
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:47,079
They were going to England.

1434
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,196
I heard him tell her.

1435
01:23:48,477 --> 01:23:50,191
- May I use your phone, ma'am?

1436
01:24:29,244 --> 01:24:30,918
- Madame?

1437
01:24:33,392 --> 01:24:34,628
- Suicide?

1438
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:37,021
- That is what the police
suspect, Monsieur Gale.

1439
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:38,417
- That's terrible.
- Oui.

1440
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:41,210
- What about her husband?
Has he been told?

1441
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:43,204
- I believe the police
have been unable

1442
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:46,515
to trace the whereabouts
of Monsieur Richards...so far.

1443
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,469
- Is there anything
we can do to help?

1444
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,461
- I regret that it is too late
for anyone to help the daughter

1445
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:53,974
of Madame Giselle.

1446
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,767
However, if you both
would be so kind,

1447
01:24:57,047 --> 01:24:58,562
there is something
you could do to help.

1448
01:24:58,842 --> 01:25:01,434
Please join me in my suite,

1449
01:25:01,714 --> 01:25:02,710
as I have called together

1450
01:25:02,991 --> 01:25:05,304
all those I consider relevant
to this case.

1451
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:08,016
- Why?
Surely, you don't think--

1452
01:25:08,296 --> 01:25:09,531
- Mademoiselle,

1453
01:25:09,812 --> 01:25:14,877
I think only of apprehending
the murderer of Madame Giselle.

1454
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:17,350
I hope you
only think of that also.

1455
01:25:29,278 --> 01:25:31,032
Mesdames et messieurs,

1456
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:33,944
first, I have the task

1457
01:25:34,224 --> 01:25:37,534
to restore the reputation
of Hercule Poirot,

1458
01:25:37,814 --> 01:25:39,409
the celebrated detective

1459
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:41,243
who had the misfortune
not to observe

1460
01:25:41,524 --> 01:25:43,079
the cunning murder
of Madame Marie Giselle

1461
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:45,911
even though it took place
not ten meters away from him.

1462
01:25:48,505 --> 01:25:51,815
And so...

1463
01:25:52,095 --> 01:25:54,687
when I had the dubious pleasure

1464
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:57,838
to attend the final
of the tennis match,

1465
01:25:58,118 --> 01:26:01,508
I observed an incident
between you, Lady Horbury,

1466
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:04,420
and Madame Giselle.

1467
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,930
It seemed to me quite clear
that she had some hold of you...

1468
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,603
- No more money,
comprenez?

1469
01:26:10,883 --> 01:26:13,674
- A hold that you might go
to any lengths to be rid of.

1470
01:26:13,954 --> 01:26:16,586
- Oh, now, that is outrageous.

1471
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:18,541
Cicely would never be involved--

1472
01:26:18,821 --> 01:26:20,615
- Monsieur Raymond Barraclough,

1473
01:26:20,895 --> 01:26:22,529
you are, I understand, an actor?

1474
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:26,399
A profession that I think
would equip you very well

1475
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:28,952
for the impersonation
of the mysterious American

1476
01:26:29,232 --> 01:26:31,624
who seems to have been
the accomplice of the murderer.

1477
01:26:31,905 --> 01:26:34,177
- And how are we supposed to
have carried out this murder?

1478
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,331
- Well, as for opportunity,

1479
01:26:36,612 --> 01:26:37,608
the wooden tube was hidden

1480
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:42,435
in the gap next to your seat
on the plane.

1481
01:26:42,715 --> 01:26:45,426
But as my experiments proved
most conclusively,

1482
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:46,743
it would have been impossible

1483
01:26:47,023 --> 01:26:48,657
for anyone to have blown
the dart on the plane

1484
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:51,769
without the greatest risk
of being seen.

1485
01:26:52,049 --> 01:26:57,074
And so we ask ourselves
this question.

1486
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:02,699
why was the wooden tube
hidden in such a place

1487
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:05,531
where it would undoubtedly
have been found?

1488
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:07,645
- To mislead us.

1489
01:27:07,925 --> 01:27:10,756
- Vraiment,
Chief Inspector.

1490
01:27:11,036 --> 01:27:15,104
So next, we come to the wasp.

1491
01:27:15,385 --> 01:27:17,457
What was the purpose
of the wasp?

1492
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:18,893
- The same thing.

1493
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:20,130
To mislead us as well.

1494
01:27:20,411 --> 01:27:23,162
- Thank you, Mademoiselle Grey.

1495
01:27:23,442 --> 01:27:24,319
You know, Mademoiselle Grey

1496
01:27:24,599 --> 01:27:25,755
has been such a help to me
throughout.

1497
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:27,510
Une parfaite assistante.

1498
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:30,142
And she is right.

1499
01:27:30,423 --> 01:27:33,653
But by the time the body of
Madame Giselle was discovered,

1500
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,508
the wasp,
it was dead also,

1501
01:27:36,787 --> 01:27:39,898
because it had been killed...

1502
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:41,733
by Monsieur Dupont.

1503
01:27:42,014 --> 01:27:44,126
- It was buzzing
around my coffee.

1504
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:46,240
- But did you
have to kill it, sir?

1505
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:48,315
Was that really necessary?

1506
01:27:48,595 --> 01:27:49,591
What?

1507
01:27:49,872 --> 01:27:51,347
Are you saying
that because I killed a wasp,

1508
01:27:51,626 --> 01:27:53,860
I also killed Madame Giselle?

1509
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:57,130
That is ridiculous.

1510
01:27:58,408 --> 01:28:02,396
- If the wasp was put there
to mislead us,

1511
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,750
was there not also a danger
of it failing to do so?

1512
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,223
Unless, of course, our attention
was drawn to it

1513
01:28:07,503 --> 01:28:09,177
by the murderer himself.

1514
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:11,451
- It's a wasp sting.

1515
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:14,841
I killed a wasp with my cup.

1516
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:18,153
All I did was kill a wasp
with my cup.

1517
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,589
- However,
mesdames et messieurs,

1518
01:28:19,868 --> 01:28:20,745
we know that the murder,

1519
01:28:21,026 --> 01:28:22,820
it was not committed
by the wasp.

1520
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:24,295
And we know
that it was not committed

1521
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,572
by the use of the wooden tube.

1522
01:28:25,852 --> 01:28:27,047
No.

1523
01:28:27,328 --> 01:28:30,718
It was committed
by the poison dart being pushed

1524
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:35,544
into the neck of Madame Giselle
by the hand.

1525
01:28:35,824 --> 01:28:39,334
Now, we know
of only three people

1526
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,687
who passed by Madame Giselle
during the flight:

1527
01:28:41,968 --> 01:28:42,924
the two air stewards,

1528
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:46,754
Monsieur Mitchell
and Mademoiselle Jane Grey;

1529
01:28:47,033 --> 01:28:48,549
and Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

1530
01:28:48,828 --> 01:28:51,939
- Oh, I really--
I didn't come all this way to--

1531
01:28:52,219 --> 01:28:54,731
- So why did you come
all this way, Mr. Clancy?

1532
01:28:55,012 --> 01:28:57,563
Because it would have been
too suspicious to have refused?

1533
01:28:57,844 --> 01:28:59,518
- How dare you!

1534
01:28:59,798 --> 01:29:01,911
- Monsieur Clancy displayed
an expert knowledge

1535
01:29:02,192 --> 01:29:03,427
of the murder weapon.

1536
01:29:03,707 --> 01:29:06,459
- Goodness, it's a dart.

1537
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:08,414
Native dart.

1538
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:10,767
- And in his house,

1539
01:29:11,047 --> 01:29:12,841
I found a wooden tube
very similar

1540
01:29:13,121 --> 01:29:16,391
to the one we discovered
on the plane.

1541
01:29:16,672 --> 01:29:17,468
- I told you,

1542
01:29:17,749 --> 01:29:19,981
it was for research for a book.

1543
01:29:20,262 --> 01:29:22,176
- For a book that you
never wrote, Monsieur Clancy.

1544
01:29:22,455 --> 01:29:24,330
- Because Wilbraham
wouldn't let me.

1545
01:29:26,963 --> 01:29:30,233
He thought the whole idea
preposterous.

1546
01:29:32,627 --> 01:29:34,701
How can I write
a detective story

1547
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:38,250
when my detective refuses
to take any part in it?

1548
01:29:38,531 --> 01:29:40,564
- What's he talking about?

1549
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:42,559
- I feel that Monsieur Clancy
suffers from a malady

1550
01:29:42,839 --> 01:29:43,955
common to many writers
of fiction.

1551
01:29:44,235 --> 01:29:46,388
His characters,
they take control.

1552
01:29:46,668 --> 01:29:48,024
At times, they appear to him
more real

1553
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:49,619
than the world around him.

1554
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:53,369
- You mean he's a madman.

1555
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,124
A murdering madman.

1556
01:29:55,404 --> 01:29:56,880
Keep him away from me.

1557
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:00,669
- Please, Lady Horbury,

1558
01:30:00,949 --> 01:30:02,624
rest calm.

1559
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:06,612
Now, as for
the two air stewards,

1560
01:30:06,893 --> 01:30:08,806
I have already discounted
Monsieur Mitchell.

1561
01:30:09,087 --> 01:30:11,001
- Well, that only seems
to leave you, Miss Grey.

1562
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,556
Wouldn't you say?

1563
01:30:12,836 --> 01:30:13,912
- Now, look, I'm sorry.

1564
01:30:14,192 --> 01:30:15,508
I protest.

1565
01:30:15,788 --> 01:30:17,662
This is past a joke.

1566
01:30:17,942 --> 01:30:18,899
- No.

1567
01:30:19,178 --> 01:30:22,169
It's all right, Norman.

1568
01:30:24,683 --> 01:30:26,996
- I was indeed suspicious
of Mademoiselle Grey.

1569
01:30:27,277 --> 01:30:30,985
I was suspicious
of her new friendship

1570
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,221
with Monsieur Gale.

1571
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:35,333
Was this friendship really new?

1572
01:30:35,613 --> 01:30:41,237
Or was she the true daughter
of Madame Giselle?

1573
01:30:41,517 --> 01:30:45,346
But then, of course, at last,
we met the real daughter

1574
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:48,417
of Madame Giselle.

1575
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:50,770
As soon as she entered
the room...

1576
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:52,845
- I...was looking
for Inspector Fournier.

1577
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,517
- I was convinced

1578
01:30:55,797 --> 01:30:58,548
I had seen this lady
somewhere before.

1579
01:31:00,425 --> 01:31:02,059
It was not until
Mademoiselle Grey

1580
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,606
caught her nail
that I remembered.

1581
01:31:06,887 --> 01:31:08,442
- Oh, my nail.

1582
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:09,838
I must file it.

1583
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:12,310
- In the lobby of the hotel,

1584
01:31:12,591 --> 01:31:14,545
when I first saw Lady Horbury,

1585
01:31:14,824 --> 01:31:16,300
she was accompanied by her maid.

1586
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:17,896
- Fetch my cigarettes, will you?

1587
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:19,691
- Yes, Lady Horbury.

1588
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:22,323
- On the plane when she
called out for the nail file,

1589
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:25,076
it was brought to her
by this same maid,

1590
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:28,745
a lady
that we later came to know

1591
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:30,700
as Anne Giselle.

1592
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:33,532
- I've come to claim
my inheritance.

1593
01:31:33,812 --> 01:31:36,005
- This is all very ingenious,

1594
01:31:36,285 --> 01:31:38,917
but I'm afraid Monsieur Poirot
doesn't really mean it.

1595
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:41,191
He keeps deliberately changing
his story.

1596
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:44,342
First, poor Jane killed Giselle.

1597
01:31:44,622 --> 01:31:46,815
And now her daughter did.

1598
01:31:47,096 --> 01:31:47,932
- No, no, no, Monsieur Gale,

1599
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:49,568
the daughter
did not kill the mother.

1600
01:31:49,848 --> 01:31:50,963
The maid of Lady Horbury,

1601
01:31:51,244 --> 01:31:53,237
she left the first-class cabin
at the start of the flight,

1602
01:31:53,518 --> 01:31:54,993
and we know that Madame Giselle

1603
01:31:55,272 --> 01:31:57,585
did not die
until shortly before we landed.

1604
01:31:57,866 --> 01:32:01,016
- Then how...did she die?

1605
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:03,250
- Hmm.

1606
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,763
You will recall, Monsieur Gale,

1607
01:32:06,043 --> 01:32:07,279
that I asked you
to disguise yourself

1608
01:32:07,559 --> 01:32:09,273
as a reporter
to go to see Lady Horbury.

1609
01:32:09,553 --> 01:32:11,388
- We'd really like to do a piece
on you for our series...

1610
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:12,743
- What, he was--

1611
01:32:13,024 --> 01:32:15,416
- I apologize for the deceit,
madame.

1612
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:18,807
But you know, at first,
the disguise of Monsieur Gale,

1613
01:32:19,087 --> 01:32:22,596
it was hopelessly
unconvincing, huh?

1614
01:32:22,877 --> 01:32:26,227
But why?

1615
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:28,939
Why was the disguise
of Monsieur Gale

1616
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:33,407
so unconvincing?

1617
01:32:33,686 --> 01:32:35,920
There are two reasons for this.

1618
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:39,770
First, to make me believe
that it would be impossible

1619
01:32:40,051 --> 01:32:42,443
for him to impersonate
the mysterious American;

1620
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,119
and secondly,

1621
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:48,427
and most important of all,

1622
01:32:48,707 --> 01:32:52,017
to ensure that I would
never learn the truth

1623
01:32:52,297 --> 01:32:54,331
about how this murder
was committed.

1624
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:04,303
You see,

1625
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,138
in the list
of the personal belongings

1626
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:07,694
of Monsieur Gale,

1627
01:33:07,974 --> 01:33:09,010
I had already noticed

1628
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:12,640
that he was traveling
with his dentist's coat.

1629
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,871
During the flight,
when coffee had been served

1630
01:33:16,151 --> 01:33:19,261
and the air stewards were
in another part of the plane,

1631
01:33:19,542 --> 01:33:22,932
Monsieur Gale makes the visit
to the toilettes.

1632
01:33:23,211 --> 01:33:26,800
He changes
into his dentist's coat

1633
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:28,077
and alters his appearance

1634
01:33:28,357 --> 01:33:29,593
with the help
of some cotton wool

1635
01:33:29,873 --> 01:33:31,627
which he had brought
for the purpose.

1636
01:33:36,654 --> 01:33:38,568
He picks up a spoon,

1637
01:33:38,849 --> 01:33:41,400
which gives him the task
of a steward to carry out,

1638
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,389
and hurries down the corridor
of the plane.

1639
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:47,902
He then pushes the poison thorn

1640
01:33:48,183 --> 01:33:53,208
into the neck
of Madame Marie Giselle.

1641
01:33:53,487 --> 01:33:57,595
On his way back,
while I was asleep,

1642
01:33:57,876 --> 01:34:02,263
he put the wooden tube
into the seat in front of mine.

1643
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:04,975
He then returned
to the toilettes

1644
01:34:05,255 --> 01:34:10,440
and removed his disguise.

1645
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,035
- Very good.

1646
01:34:12,316 --> 01:34:16,862
Very good, Monsieur Poirot.

1647
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:19,176
You have thrown
the real murderer

1648
01:34:19,456 --> 01:34:21,051
completely off his guard.

1649
01:34:21,331 --> 01:34:22,566
Now...

1650
01:34:24,562 --> 01:34:27,314
could we have the real solution,
please?

1651
01:34:27,593 --> 01:34:28,909
- I think you will find,
Monsieur Gale,

1652
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:31,143
that the truth
of how this crime began

1653
01:34:31,423 --> 01:34:35,052
is even more intriguing.

1654
01:34:35,332 --> 01:34:36,528
Anne Giselle hated her mother

1655
01:34:36,808 --> 01:34:38,881
for abandoning her
when she was a baby.

1656
01:34:39,162 --> 01:34:40,557
She was brought up in Canada

1657
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:43,309
and came to England
to work as a maid.

1658
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,662
By coincidence,

1659
01:34:45,943 --> 01:34:49,013
she came into the employment
of Lady Horbury

1660
01:34:49,293 --> 01:34:51,806
and began to move
into the high society.

1661
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:55,515
Despite your humble profession,
Monsieur Gale,

1662
01:34:55,796 --> 01:34:59,026
you aspired yourself
to this society.

1663
01:34:59,305 --> 01:35:01,937
And no doubt,
it was on one such occasion

1664
01:35:02,218 --> 01:35:05,249
that you met the maid
of Lady Horbury.

1665
01:35:05,528 --> 01:35:08,918
Your...relationship?

1666
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,434
It developed,

1667
01:35:10,714 --> 01:35:15,021
until one day, this same maid
told to you her secret.

1668
01:35:15,302 --> 01:35:17,295
She pointed out to you
her mother

1669
01:35:17,576 --> 01:35:21,443
and told you of the power
she had over Lady Horbury.

1670
01:35:27,149 --> 01:35:29,700
Of course, after 23 years,

1671
01:35:29,981 --> 01:35:32,692
Madame Giselle did not recognize
her daughter.

1672
01:35:32,973 --> 01:35:34,128
And luckily for you,

1673
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:36,363
her daughter
hated her mother so much

1674
01:35:36,642 --> 01:35:39,833
that she willingly agreed
to your plan...

1675
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,856
to murder her in such a way

1676
01:35:46,136 --> 01:35:49,685
that Lady Horbury
would be blamed.

1677
01:35:49,966 --> 01:35:51,161
- He planned all that?

1678
01:35:51,442 --> 01:35:53,715
I could've--

1679
01:35:53,994 --> 01:35:55,629
I mean, the police very nearly--

1680
01:35:55,909 --> 01:35:58,102
- With Madame Giselle dead,
it was essential

1681
01:35:58,383 --> 01:36:01,134
that Monsieur Gale should
now be married to the daughter.

1682
01:36:01,414 --> 01:36:03,208
Anne would claim
her inheritance,

1683
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:05,083
but in the event of her death,

1684
01:36:05,363 --> 01:36:09,112
her husband would receive
the wealth of Madame Giselle.

1685
01:36:09,392 --> 01:36:11,266
But then Monsieur Gale learned
that I had met Anne

1686
01:36:11,546 --> 01:36:16,053
in the office
of Inspector Fournier.

1687
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:17,768
- He ordered a taxi
for the Gare du Nord.

1688
01:36:18,048 --> 01:36:19,803
- He was terrified
that I might discover

1689
01:36:20,082 --> 01:36:22,953
that also she was the maid.

1690
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:51,235
- Madame?

1691
01:36:51,516 --> 01:36:53,229
- The poor woman's death
was suicide.

1692
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,306
You told me.

1693
01:36:54,587 --> 01:36:55,943
- No, no, no, no, no,
Monsieur Gale.

1694
01:36:56,222 --> 01:36:57,458
You see, you left
your fingerprints

1695
01:36:57,739 --> 01:36:58,854
on the poison bottle.

1696
01:36:59,134 --> 01:37:01,208
- Now, that's absolutely
ridiculous because I wore--

1697
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,832
- You wore the gloves
when you committed the murder?

1698
01:37:09,426 --> 01:37:10,183
Indeed.

1699
01:37:10,463 --> 01:37:12,975
Thank you.

1700
01:37:31,165 --> 01:37:33,718
- You better come along
with me, sir.

1701
01:37:33,998 --> 01:37:35,433
- Why?

1702
01:37:35,713 --> 01:37:37,787
Why did you do it, Norman?

1703
01:37:38,067 --> 01:37:39,821
- For the money, Jane.

1704
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:42,853
For a very great deal of money.

1705
01:37:43,132 --> 01:37:46,084
Why else?

1706
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:18,953
- I thought...

1707
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,064
I don't know.

1708
01:38:22,345 --> 01:38:24,417
- You liked Monsieur Gale?

1709
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:26,412
- Yes.

1710
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:29,723
- And you thought
that he liked you?

1711
01:38:30,003 --> 01:38:32,874
But you are wrong,
mademoiselle.

1712
01:38:33,154 --> 01:38:34,390
- Obviously.

1713
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:36,824
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1714
01:38:37,103 --> 01:38:39,177
He did not like you.

1715
01:38:39,457 --> 01:38:42,248
He loved you.

1716
01:38:42,528 --> 01:38:44,602
It is true.

1717
01:38:44,882 --> 01:38:47,753
I see it in the eyes.

1718
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:02,113
- I was getting
a bit worried there, Poirot,

1719
01:39:02,393 --> 01:39:03,629
in case you'd done it after all,

1720
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:05,504
in your sleep perhaps.

1721
01:39:05,784 --> 01:39:09,173
- Very droll, Chief Inspector.

1722
01:39:09,454 --> 01:39:11,088
- One thing
I don't understand, though.

1723
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:13,482
What put you on to Norman Gale
in the first place?

1724
01:39:13,762 --> 01:39:15,477
- In the first place?
Et bien.

1725
01:39:15,756 --> 01:39:18,189
In the first place, I looked
for the home of the wasp.

1726
01:39:18,469 --> 01:39:20,183
And in the belongings
of Monsieur Gale,

1727
01:39:20,464 --> 01:39:22,138
there was a matchbox,

1728
01:39:22,418 --> 01:39:25,089
an empty matchbox.

1729
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:27,124
Parfait.

1730
01:39:27,404 --> 01:39:29,478
- So where are you taking me,
Poirot?

1731
01:39:29,757 --> 01:39:31,632
A little farewell lunch I hope.

1732
01:39:31,912 --> 01:39:34,105
Nice little restaurant
you've just discovered?

1733
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,458
I'm getting quite keen
on this French food, you know.

1734
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,051
- Not exactly, Chief Inspector.

1735
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:41,963
Food for the soul, mon ami.
