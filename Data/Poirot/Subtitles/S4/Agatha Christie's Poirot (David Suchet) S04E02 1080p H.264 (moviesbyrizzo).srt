1
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,583
- Oh, allow me, mademoiselle.

2
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:24,708
Voilà.

3
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,708
- Thank you.

4
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,791
- It is like an enormous
birthday cake, is it not?

5
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:37,583
So strange and so out of place
in this beautiful neighborhood.

6
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,708
Near the end of the last century
when it was being built,

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,874
so many of the great artists,
they lived here.

8
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,208
Oh, yes.

9
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,208
Renoir, Manet, van Gogh,
so many.

10
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,166
It amuses me
to imagine their dismay

11
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,458
as they saw it
being constructed.

12
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,749
- Well, actually,
I think it's rather beautiful.

13
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,833
- You know, when they
lived here, mademoiselle,

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,374
Montmartre was just a village
in the countryside.

15
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,333
Strange church for a village,
n'est-ce pas?

16
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,458
However, for myself,
I am very happy

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,166
that it is no longer
the countryside.

18
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,958
I greatly prefer under my feet
the paving stones.

19
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,666
Excuse me.

20
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,791
- On demande Monsieur Johnson.

21
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,708
Paging Mr. Johnson.

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,874
On demande Monsieur Johnson.

23
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,708
Paging Mr. Johnson.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,166
- I'd much rather spend
the afternoon shopping.

25
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,958
There are so many gorgeous shops
in Paris.

26
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,333
It's quite absurd.

27
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,208
- We've already bought
the tickets, darling.

28
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,791
- It is why we came, Cecily.

29
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,916
- Yes, Venetia, thank you.

30
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,374
I do realize.

31
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,458
But I didn't realize

32
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,333
we'd spend the whole week
watching tennis.

33
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,124
For goodness' sake.

34
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,541
Well, really!

35
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,791
I do think Frenchmen
are so rude.

36
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:09,499
Don't you, Venetia?

37
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:20,499
Where's Madeleine?

38
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,041
Madeleine!

39
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,374
Fetch my cigarettes, will you?

40
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,124
- Yes, Lady Horbury.

41
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,124
- Quarante, trente.

42
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,041
Jeu, Monsieur Perry.

43
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,624
Monsieur Perry mène
par quatre jeux à trois

44
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,166
dans le premier set.

45
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,916
- Excuse me.

46
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,708
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,333
- He was jolly good,
even you must admit, Cecily.

48
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,833
- Who was?

49
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,499
- Fred Perry, darling,

50
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,458
the English one.

51
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,374
- I wish I'd seen Perry
at Wimbledon last year.

52
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,624
They say he was marvelous.

53
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,708
- Well, let's hope he wins again
in the final.

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,791
- Yes, that would be nice,
wouldn't it?

55
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,583
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,374
- I felt I ought to apologize...

57
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,749
in case my clapping
deafened you.

58
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,166
Oh, no, don't worry.

59
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,458
- Did you enjoy the game?

60
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,749
- Oh, yes.

61
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,458
It's a wonderful tournament,
isn't it?

62
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,708
- I'm Norman Gale.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,791
- Jane Grey.

64
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,833
- Wasn't she a queen
or something?

65
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,666
- Briefly.
No relation, I'm afraid.

66
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,166
I'm just an air stewardess.

67
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,416
- Well, I hope you're not flying
back before the final.

68
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,166
- Oh, no, no, definitely not.

69
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,541
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

70
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,624
- Good.

71
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,708
- Garçon!

72
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,749
Garçon!

73
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,791
Oh, for heaven's sake!

74
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,791
- Dix rouge.

75
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,916
- Merci.

76
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,666
- Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

77
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,124
Faites vos jeux.

78
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,541
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

79
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,374
Faites vos jeux.

80
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,374
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

81
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,416
- Quinze noir.

82
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,416
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

83
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,958
Faites vos jeux.

84
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,583
- That was a lovely dinner.
Thank you, Stephen.

85
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,041
- Glad you enjoyed it.

86
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:01,458
- You mustn't worry about Cecily
not turning up.

87
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,833
Really.

88
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,749
There's probably
a perfectly good reason.

89
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:11,124
She's probably
back at the hotel now.

90
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,583
- She's been worse than ever
this week.

91
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,833
It was marvelous that you
could come with us, Venetia.

92
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,541
- Oh, well.

93
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,499
I'm very good at being
a friend of the family.

94
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,333
It's my role in life, I think.

95
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,791
- Oh.

96
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,124
- Bonsoir, madame.
Bonsoir, monsieur.

97
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,708
- Good evening.

98
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,666
- Oh, madame.

99
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,541
- Madame Giselle,
s'il vous plaît.

100
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,499
- Le premier étage.

101
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,166
I will not tolerate it!

102
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,374
Do you understand?

103
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,374
I will not tolerate it!

104
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,083
Hello, darling.

105
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,166
Can't you sleep?

106
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,749
- It's 3:00.

107
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,458
- Is it?

108
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,041
- Did you see her?

109
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:13,249
- Who?

110
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:14,708
- That woman.

111
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,083
- I might have paid her
just a little visit, Stephen.

112
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,166
On the other hand,
I might not.

113
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,416
- I suppose you went
to the casino.

114
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,833
- I might have spent
just a few francs, yes, Stephen,

115
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,374
I must confess.

116
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,749
- I'm not helping anymore,
Cecily.

117
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:33,833
I'm simply not.

118
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,708
You'll just have to tell her!

119
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,624
- Oh, don't get so excited,
darling.

120
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,249
You and Venetia love
riding around on horses,

121
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,749
and I love smoking
and drinking

122
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,291
and losing money
at the roulette table.

123
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,708
So long as we all leave
each other to our own devices,

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,124
I don't see what the problem is.

125
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:18,041
- I'm going back to London
in the morning.

126
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,541
- And miss the final?

127
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,083
What will Venetia think?

128
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,624
- Ah, mademoiselle.

129
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,333
I did not take you for
an admirer of the avant-garde.

130
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,374
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

131
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,999
You are a little baffled
by what you see?

132
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,999
- Yes, I'm afraid I am,
actually.

133
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,166
- Well, it's hardly surprising,
mademoiselle.

134
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,166
The surrealists, you see,
they free themselves

135
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,999
from the demands of logic.

136
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,958
They do not paint
what we see before us,

137
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,499
the real world as we call it.

138
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:35,958
No, no, no.

139
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,416
No, they struggle to express
the unconscious,

140
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,833
the dream world.

141
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,749
So one cannot approach their
work in way that has logic.

142
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,291
You have to experience it.

143
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,583
You have to open your mind
to it.

144
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,874
That is all.

145
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,833
Come.
I will show you more.

146
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
So, Mademoiselle Grey,

147
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,458
how does the world look

148
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,249
now that the surrealists
have opened your mind to it?

149
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,458
- It's all looking
a little strange now actually.

150
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,791
But I'm sure
it's only temporary.

151
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,208
It's been fascinating
meeting you, Mr. Poirot.

152
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,083
- Ah, no, no, no, no.
You are too kind.

153
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,999
- No, it has.

154
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,624
But now there's a little bit
of Paris I'd like to show you,

155
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,166
somewhere I'm almost sure
you've never been.

156
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,458
- Oh, I have seen much of Paris,
Mademoiselle Grey.

157
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,708
Do not be so sure.

158
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,458
You are very clever,
Mademoiselle Grey,

159
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,958
to obtain for me a seat
at such short notice.

160
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,708
- That's your seat there.

161
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,624
- Well, thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.

162
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,708
You are too kind.

163
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,791
- I'll see you later.

164
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:53,833
- Indeed.
Au revoir.

165
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,499
- Au revoir.

166
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,083
- Excuse me.
Pardon.

167
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:06,916
Pardon.

168
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:17,458
- I really don't know why
you're staying, Cecily.

169
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,874
Why didn't you go back
with Stephen?

170
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,291
- Perhaps because even this
is preferable

171
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:23,541
to being stuck in the country

172
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,374
with all that mud
and horse manure.

173
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,041
- Oh, you must have known
what he was like

174
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,416
before you married him.

175
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,291
- One never knows
what one's husband is like

176
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,333
before one marries him.

177
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,624
That's one of the problems
with marriage.

178
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,374
- Are you sure you're
not staying for other reasons?

179
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,541
- What do you mean?

180
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,958
- What about that actor friend
of yours?

181
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,958
Isn't he keen on tennis?

182
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,416
- Trente par tout.

183
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,583
Trente, quarante.

184
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:51,374
- It is interesting, is it not,

185
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,874
how the British regard tennis
as their own invention

186
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,208
and any tennis trophy
as rightfully theirs?

187
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,083
When the truth is,
it was a French game originally.

188
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
Jeu de pomme.

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,291
11th century, I think.

190
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:06,124
- It was a jolly good game,
wasn't it?

191
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,583
And Perry absolutely thrashed
von Cramm.

192
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,749
Are either of you
going to Wimbledon?

193
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,666
- For myself, I think not.

194
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,874
- Depends if I can get
the time off.

195
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,499
- Me too.

196
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,749
- Some more.
Garçon!

197
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,749
Garçon!

198
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,499
- You've had enough, Cecily.

199
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,958
- I have nothing for you,
madame, nothing.

200
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,624
Do you hear?

201
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,249
The cupboard is bare.

202
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,249
No more money,
comprenez?

203
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,958
- Pardon, madame.

204
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,208
- Good morning, sir.
Welcome aboard.

205
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,083
- I hear Miss Grey
will be traveling with us,

206
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,041
ready to cater
for our every need.

207
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:45,874
- How delightful,
a little party.

208
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,291
Ah, and there are two more
to join us,

209
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,833
two more aficionados
of the game of tennis.

210
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,333
- Oh, yes.

211
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,333
Yes, I saw them yesterday.
What a coincidence.

212
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,874
- No, no, no, no, Monsieur Gale,
it is not a coincidence.

213
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,374
You will go to Paris
for the tennis.

214
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,874
The tennis finishes.
You go home.

215
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,958
What could be more logical?

216
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,583
- Bonjour, monsieur.

217
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,958
Le Bourget, s'il vous plaît.

218
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,999
- Au revoir, Elise.

219
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,124
A bien tôt.

220
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,499
- Au revoir, madame.

221
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,458
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

222
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,041
- It'll be in here, sir,
if you need it.

223
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:44,124
- Thank you.

224
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,916
- Morning.
- Good morning.

225
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,874
You're at the end, Mr. Gale,
on the right.

226
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,416
- Call me Norman, if you like.

227
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,333
- I shall have a rug,
if I may.

228
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,541
Thank you.

229
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,624
- Uh, your hat, sir.

230
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,333
- Thank you very much.

231
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,291
Thank you.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,291
- This way, ladies.

233
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,833
Lady Horbury.

234
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,208
Miss Kerr.

235
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,791
- Is everything all right,
Mr. Dupont?

236
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,083
- Yes.

237
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,874
- Would you like me to take
your case for you?

238
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,291
- No, no, it contains
valuable archaeological pieces.

239
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,499
Equatorial African pipes,
you see?

240
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,291
For a lecture I'm giving to the
British Archaeological Society.

241
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,458
- Really?
How interesting.

242
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,249
If you'll excuse me.

243
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:49,499
This way, madame.

244
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,749
- Excuse me for asking, sir,

245
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,499
but I couldn't help wondering.

246
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,499
Would you, by any chance,
be Mr. Daniel Clancy,

247
00:19:58,792 --> 00:19:59,791
the detective writer?

248
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,083
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.

249
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,583
- I'd just like to say, sir,

250
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,791
I'm a great admirer
of your Wilbraham Rice stories.

251
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:06,041
He's so brilliant,

252
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,416
a real genius,

253
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,291
the way he can always work out
who did it.

254
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,291
- Yes.

255
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,374
Yes, I don't know how he does it
myself sometimes.

256
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,999
- Ow!
My fingernail.

257
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:34,999
Steward!

258
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,166
- What can I do for you, madame?

259
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,833
- Get me my maid.

260
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,333
She's in the other compartment.

261
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,791
Tell her to bring
my dressing case.

262
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,666
- Yes, madame.

263
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,708
- Thank you, Madeleine.
That'll be all.

264
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:41,249
- Are you all right, sir?

265
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:42,874
- No, I am not all right.
Thank you.

266
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,416
How can I be all right?

267
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,374
- Would you like something
to drink, sir?

268
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,416
- No.
Thank you.

269
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:52,249
Mon estomac.

270
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:54,083
- Ah.

271
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,749
- Would you like some food,
Norman?

272
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,791
- Yes, please.

273
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,124
- If you wouldn't mind, Cecily.

274
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:37,333
No.
My throat.

275
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:41,624
- Of course not, dear.

276
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,958
- Anything for you, sir?
- Uh, no, thank you.

277
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,333
- More coffee, sir?

278
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,083
Coffee, miss?

279
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,999
Lady Horbury?

280
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,416
More coffee, sir?

281
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,333
- Hmm?
Uh, no, thank you.

282
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,166
- No, thank you.

283
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,916
- Madame?

284
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,458
More coffee, madame?

285
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,541
Madame?

286
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,291
Oh, my God.

287
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,374
Is there a doctor?

288
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,166
- What is it?

289
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:34,999
- Is anyone a doctor?

290
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,958
- I'm a dentist
if I can be of any help.

291
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,041
- What is it?
What has happened?

292
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,291
- I'm afraid she's dead.

293
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,458
- What--what is it, a fit?

294
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,083
- No.

295
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,374
No, I think not.

296
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,791
Regardez.

297
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,958
- It's a wasp sting.

298
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,124
I killed a wasp with my cup.

299
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:16,708
- Yes, I saw it too.

300
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,083
- People do die of wasp stings,
but...

301
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,666
- You must go back
to your seats,

302
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:21,791
please, gentlemen.

303
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:24,041
We're about to land.

304
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,666
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?

305
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,249
- Another wasp?

306
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,541
- Yes, it is very like a wasp.

307
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,083
But it is not a wasp.

308
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,791
- Goodness, it's a dart.

309
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:49,624
A native dart.

310
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,208
South American, I think.

311
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,208
- You have seen one of these
before, monsieur?

312
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,666
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.

313
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,916
Better be careful.

314
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:01,166
- Yes, you are right.

315
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:04,458
We must be very careful,

316
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,458
because unless I am
very much mistaken, mes amis,

317
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,749
the end is coated with poison.

318
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,333
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

319
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,916
- No, thank you.

320
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,124
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

321
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,416
I'm extremely sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

322
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,291
The police won't keep you
very long.

323
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,958
They'll let you go

324
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,249
as soon as they've gone through
your hand luggage.

325
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,083
- Excuse me, Mr. Poirot.
- Yes.

326
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,541
- Would you mind
stepping outside?

327
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:16,958
- Not at all.

328
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:25,416
- I knew there was something
suspicious about him.

329
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:28,541
Didn't I say?

330
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,374
- Thank you.

331
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,666
- Well, well, seems you can't
even fly on an airplane now

332
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,624
without somebody
getting murdered.

333
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,958
I've been onto the Sûreté
in Paris.

334
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,166
I spoke to a chap
called Fournier.

335
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:43,708
Inspector Fournier?

336
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,916
- No.

337
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,249
- I asked him to find out
about the murdered woman,

338
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,791
but he knew
all about her already.

339
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:52,916
Her name's Giselle,
Marie Giselle,

340
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,666
well-known moneylender,

341
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,083
specialized in lending
to society people,

342
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,833
always kept an ear open
for their latest scandals,

343
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,624
and then used them
to blackmail them

344
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:03,374
when they got behind
with their payments.

345
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,999
Anyway, what can you tell me?

346
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,666
I gather you were sitting
just a few yards

347
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,166
from the scene of the crime.

348
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:12,124
- Well, unfortunately,
Chief Inspector Japp,

349
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:13,958
at the time of the murder,
I was asleep.

350
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,708
- Asleep?
Really?

351
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,124
Oh, well, well.

352
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,499
Still, I dare say
you have a theory or two

353
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,083
about who committed it.

354
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,333
- How could I possibly have
a theory, Chief Inspector,

355
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,666
when I still do not
fully comprehend what happened?

356
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,166
- A bit odd, though,
don't you think?

357
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:31,166
Death by poison dart
on a British airplane?

358
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:35,249
Bizarre isn't the word.

359
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,166
Jean Dupont.

360
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:46,541
Large book.

361
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:50,583
In French.

362
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,583
Cigarette holder.

363
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:56,083
Ivory, I should say.

364
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,833
Small notebook.

365
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,083
Full of scribbled notes.

366
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:11,458
Ornamental hollow tubes.

367
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,124
- African pipes
I think you will find.

368
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:19,041
I was not asleep all
of the time, Chief Inspector.

369
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,291
I heard Monsieur Dupont tell it
to the air stewardess,

370
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,124
Mademoiselle Jane Grey.

371
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,333
Monsieur Dupont,
he is an archaeologist.

372
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,208
- Could be what we're after.

373
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,499
- What exactly are you after,
Chief Inspector?

374
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,874
- Well, the question
I'm asking myself, Poirot,

375
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,874
is how did the dart
get into the body?

376
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,624
- Ah, you refer, I assume,

377
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,791
to the method used
by the South American Indians,

378
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,833
who shoot the native thorns,

379
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,874
such as was discovered
by the body,

380
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,624
through the wooden tube,
n'est-ce pas?

381
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,874
- Well, yes.

382
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,249
How do you know
about South American Indians?

383
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,083
- Because I have talked
to Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

384
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,999
The well-known writer
of the detective stories?

385
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,916
And creator of the celebrated
gentleman detective,

386
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:03,999
Monsieur Wilbraham Rice?

387
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,874
No?

388
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,541
Voilà.

389
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:13,874
Well, Monsieur Clancy

390
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,208
was one of the passengers
on the airplane.

391
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,749
He has researched
into the subject

392
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,499
for one of his books.

393
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:21,958
- Oh, has he?

394
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,374
- Oui.
Well, so he tells me.

395
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:28,249
If you please, Chief Inspector,
when you are finished,

396
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,791
could you let me have a copy
of the list

397
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:31,916
of the personal effects
of each passenger?

398
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,083
It would be
of great interest to me.

399
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,624
- And why would that
interest you?

400
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,458
What are you looking for?

401
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,833
- I do not know.

402
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,291
All I know is that
I pursue the object

403
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:46,916
that will hold the answer
to a question that troubles me.

404
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,458
But such are the dilemmas
with which we daily struggle.

405
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,791
Are they not?

406
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:53,874
- Heh.

407
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,166
- Excuse me.

408
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:06,291
Very helpful.

409
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,083
Norman Gale.

410
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:20,166
Strand Magazine.

411
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,124
England's Glory box of matches.

412
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:26,624
Empty.

413
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,833
One white linen coat.

414
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,416
Two dental mirrors.

415
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,458
Dental rolls of cotton wool.

416
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,083
Do you reckon he's a dentist,
by any chance?

417
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,458
- It's an unforgivable
invasion of privacy.

418
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,166
I demand to speak to my husband
and my lawyer at once.

419
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:56,749
- It won't do any good, Cecily.

420
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,374
- It's perfectly normal
procedure, I think you'll find.

421
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,999
After all, the murder weapon
might still be concealed

422
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,791
in someone's bag or case.

423
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,041
- Just take me to a telephone.

424
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,249
- This way, madame.

425
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:11,333
- You stay here.

426
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,999
- Yes, ma'am.

427
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,166
- I'm sorry, sir, but nobody's
allowed on the plane.

428
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:16,249
Those are my orders.

429
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,583
- We need to get on board.

430
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,249
- I've strict instructions.
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,749
- But we haven't cleared up
in there.

432
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,666
There's coffee cups
and goodness knows what.

433
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:23,749
- He won't let us on board.

434
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,416
- Oh, dear.
- Ridiculous.

435
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:26,791
In all the time
I've worked here--

436
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:28,374
- If you please,
Monsieur Mitchell.

437
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,124
Will you excuse us, Constable?

438
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,833
One moment, if you please.

439
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,791
I have a question,
if you would be so good.

440
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:38,624
Did either of you
during the flight see a wasp?

441
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,333
- A sort of squashed wasp,
yes, sir,

442
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,791
in the young Frenchman's saucer
when I gave him more coffee.

443
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,791
- But did you see
the wasp alive?

444
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:49,124
Did either of you see the wasp
flying around the cabin?

445
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:50,249
- No.

446
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,333
No, I can't say I did.

447
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:52,916
- Nor did I.

448
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:55,124
But surely it was the dart
that killed the poor woman.

449
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:56,499
Hasn't that been established?

450
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,208
- Almost certainly,
yes, mademoiselle.

451
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,291
- Then why--

452
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:00,874
- Mademoiselle Grey,

453
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,208
when was the last time you saw
to be alive Madame Giselle?

454
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,666
- Well, I suppose

455
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,333
when I collected up the plates
after the meal.

456
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,249
- Yes, she was alive
when I poured her coffee.

457
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,041
A few minutes later
that would be.

458
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:14,666
- Merci.

459
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,874
Merci bien.

460
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,374
Just one more question.

461
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,874
Madame Giselle, had she ever
flown with you before?

462
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,249
- I'd never seen her.

463
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:25,249
But I've only been working here
a few weeks.

464
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,499
- Ah, yes, of course.

465
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,583
And you, monsieur?

466
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,291
- Well, yes,
as a matter of fact,

467
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,333
she flew with us quite often.

468
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,624
She usually went in
the first plane in the morning,

469
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:34,958
the 9:00.

470
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,499
This one sometimes gets busy,

471
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,499
but there's always room
in the 9:00.

472
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,041
- They've found something,
Poirot.

473
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,541
You better come along with me.

474
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,249
- Thank you very much.

475
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,874
- A wooden pipe, Poirot.

476
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,249
- So I see, Chief Inspector.

477
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,249
- Just what I was looking for.

478
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,958
All we need to know now
is how it got here.

479
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,791
- You see the markings?

480
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,416
I think you will find...

481
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:14,458
that it is South American.

482
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,708
Just as is the dart.

483
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,833
- What's that you've got?

484
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,749
- I do not know.

485
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:37,458
But I am sure
all will become clear.

486
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,374
The wooden tube
is rather beautiful,

487
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,083
is it not, Chief Inspector?

488
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,166
- Quite frankly, Poirot,
I don't much care

489
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:49,458
whether it's beautiful
or South American.

490
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,374
At the moment,
I'd just like to know

491
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,166
who was sitting here.

492
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:57,458
- I was sitting here,
Chief Inspector.

493
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,666
- Oh.

494
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:04,291
Oh, well, that puts a different
complexion on it, I suppose.

495
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,541
- Mais non.

496
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,624
Not at all.

497
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:10,666
Check it for the fingerprints,
if you please.

498
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,333
I insist.

499
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,124
I understand it is your duty

500
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,749
as a policeman of Scotland Yard

501
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,666
to regard everyone as guilty

502
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,374
until he is proven
to be innocent.

503
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,458
- No, no, really--

504
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,124
- And I tell you,
Chief Inspector,

505
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:26,458
I regard it as my duty
to clear my name

506
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,999
of this inexcusable slur
as soon as possible.

507
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,333
- Stephen?
I had to talk to you.

508
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,958
I must warn you,
something awful's happened.

509
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,833
There's been a murder.

510
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,249
Yes, on the plane.

511
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,916
That Giselle woman.

512
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:05,958
- Oui, Inspecteur.

513
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:14,124
- Ouvrez la porte!
Police!

514
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,291
Ouvrez-nous tout de suite.

515
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:26,916
Allez... ouvrez!
Ouvrez!

516
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,458
Ouvrez la porte!

517
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,749
Ouvrez-nous tout de suite!

518
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,541
Inspecteur Fournier, Sûreté.

519
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,291
- Enchantée, Inspecteur.

520
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,833
- I demand to speak
to the person in charge.

521
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:05,958
- Sorry, madame--

522
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,041
- Don't "madame" me.

523
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:09,416
Do you know who I am?

524
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:11,624
- What's going on?

525
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,291
- It really doesn't make
any difference.

526
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,666
- What did you say?
- I've strict--

527
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,541
- I think you will discover,
Chief Inspector,

528
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:17,874
that it is Lady Horbury.

529
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,708
- Person in charge.
- So you say.

530
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,249
But I'm afraid I have
strict instructions.

531
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,374
Look, I've told you, madame.

532
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,208
- What seems to be the problem,
Constable?

533
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,416
- This lady--

534
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:28,874
- Are you
the senior policeman here?

535
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,083
- Chief Inspector Japp, yes.

536
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,249
- I'd like to talk to you
on your own.

537
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,749
I wish to complain.

538
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,833
- If you just go back
to the lounge, please, madame,

539
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,749
I shall be questioning
everyone shortly.

540
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,249
- Uh, Chief Inspector Japp,

541
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:44,249
I think it would be better
to talk to Lady Horbury now.

542
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,916
She was sitting in the seat
directly in front of mine.

543
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:49,791
- Oh, was she?
- Oui.

544
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:51,958
- Right.

545
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,916
All right, Constable.

546
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,374
Have you ever seen this before,
Lady Horbury?

547
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,749
- No, certainly not.
Why?

548
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:05,666
- Lady Horbury, at any time
during the flight,

549
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,124
did you see anyone move
to the rear of the plane?

550
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,541
- What's it got to do with you?

551
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,999
- Just answer the question,
please.

552
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:17,999
- No.

553
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,291
I was sitting facing the front.

554
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,541
How could I?
I never left my seat.

555
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,833
- But I am thinking
about the last half hour

556
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:24,958
in particular.

557
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,999
Did you not notice
anyone at all?

558
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,708
- No.

559
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,624
Well, apart from the steward
and stewardess.

560
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,916
They were clearing the tables
and then serving coffee.

561
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,124
They passed by a few times.

562
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,416
- Did you see a wasp?

563
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,083
- A wasp?
No.

564
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,749
- And did you know
the murdered woman,

565
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,749
Lady Horbury?

566
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,333
- N-no.

567
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,416
No, I'd never seen her before.

568
00:40:56,875 --> 00:41:01,208
- Just when I thought
we were getting somewhere.

569
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,708
- There is something that
troubles you, Chief Inspector?

570
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,708
- I've just heard from Fournier.

571
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,624
They've only just
dragged themselves round

572
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:08,708
to Giselle's house.

573
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,999
By the time they got there,

574
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:12,541
her blasted maid had destroyed
all her papers.

575
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,333
- Ah.

576
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:15,874
Then perhaps it was
their lunchtime

577
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,708
when you informed them
what happened.

578
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,541
- I beg your pardon.

579
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,833
- Well, it is very important
in France, the lunchtime,

580
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,916
but for the eating
and afterwards, the sleeping,

581
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:26,458
not for the catching
of the criminals

582
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,041
and the collecting
of the evidence.

583
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,458
Why do you need these papers,
Chief Inspector?

584
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,041
- Because I think Lady Horbury
knew Giselle.

585
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:36,749
I could see it in her eyes.

586
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,833
But I need proof.

587
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,374
- Well, I told them
it's a waste of time

588
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,624
looking through our luggage.

589
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,999
- Just because
they've let us go,

590
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,874
it doesn't mean
they don't suspect one of us.

591
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,249
- Exactly, all it means is

592
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,791
they couldn't find the evidence
to keep us here.

593
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,083
- Excuse me, mademoiselle,

594
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,166
that gentleman over there
with the mustaches,

595
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,624
can you tell me who he is?

596
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,916
- Yes.
That's Hercule Poirot.

597
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:59,666
He's the famous detective.

598
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:17,124
- Tell me, did either of you see
anyone pass by Madame Giselle

599
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,291
during the flight?

600
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:19,749
- Yes, I did.

601
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,208
I was handing out the meals.

602
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,999
I saw Mr. Clancy
walk right by her.

603
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,916
He was carrying a book.

604
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:29,083
I assume he'd taken it
from his bag or coat.

605
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,166
He went straight back
to his seat with it.

606
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:34,833
- Did he pause as he walked by?

607
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:37,583
Or do anything
in any way unusual?

608
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,208
- I don't think so.

609
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,166
But I wasn't really
concentrating on him.

610
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,291
I'm still not used to the work.

611
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,541
I was terrified
of dropping the food.

612
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,583
- I see.

613
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,249
And did either of you
see anyone else get up?

614
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,166
- No.

615
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:54,999
- Well, actually,
I got up myself,

616
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,041
but only to go to the toilet.

617
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:58,583
- Which is at the other end
of the cabin.

618
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,583
- Yeah.

619
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,958
- Ah.

620
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:19,833
Au revoir, Monsieur Gale.

621
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,499
- Monsieur Poirot.

622
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:27,833
- What an impressive house.

623
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:29,333
- Yes.

624
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:30,833
I wish I could say it was mine,

625
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,249
but I'm afraid it's my uncle's.

626
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:37,249
The surgery's here too.
We both work here.

627
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:41,333
- Well, good-bye.
- Ah, good-bye.

628
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,874
I was wondering,

629
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,458
are you possibly free
for dinner,

630
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,749
perhaps tomorrow night?

631
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:46,916
- Goodness.

632
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:49,666
Well, it's--how lovely.
Yes.

633
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:50,749
- Yes?
Good.

634
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,791
I'll telephone you tomorrow.

635
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,666
- You are thinking
of Monsieur Gale, mademoiselle?

636
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,458
- No, actually.

637
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,874
I was thinking of Mr. Dupont.

638
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:17,708
- Ah, the archaeologist.

639
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,333
Why is it that you think of him?

640
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:22,499
- Well, because he came up
and asked me who you were.

641
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:23,666
- Mm.

642
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,083
- It was a bit odd.
That's all.

643
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,999
- And so you see, to Poirot,
nobody is above suspicion.

644
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:33,124
- Well, I hope you don't think

645
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,041
either of them
killed the poor woman.

646
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:39,416
- En effet, mademoiselle,
either could have done it.

647
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,624
Merci.

648
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:44,249
Monsieur Gale, because he could
have had access to the poison.

649
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:47,208
He would have known the doctors.
For him, it would be easy.

650
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,291
And Monsieur Dupont,

651
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:49,874
because he travels
around the world

652
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,708
visiting the places exotiques,

653
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,666
he could have purchased
the poison and the pipes.

654
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,833
And of course,
he killed the wasp.

655
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,333
- But I thought Madame Giselle
was killed with the dart.

656
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,833
- Yes, you are right,
mademoiselle.

657
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,666
The wasp is
not so much interesting

658
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:04,583
as suggestive, I think.

659
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,833
Ah.

660
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,458
Mademoiselle Grey,

661
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,124
would you be kind enough
to help me?

662
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,583
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

663
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:45,374
- Ah.

664
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:49,666
Thank you, mademoiselle.

665
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:27,624
Good evening.

666
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:28,874
- Monsieur Poirot?

667
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:29,999
- Yes.

668
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:31,416
I'm Lord Horbury.

669
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:33,124
- Ah, yes.

670
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,083
Please.

671
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,749
- Thank you.

672
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:53,666
You see, my wife, well,

673
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:58,749
in many ways, she's just
not suited to the life I lead.

674
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,874
It's a bit of a washout,
really, our marriage.

675
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,958
It's entirely my fault.

676
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,749
I freely admit that.

677
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,583
I fell for her, you see.

678
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,958
Hook, line, and sinker.

679
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,916
Well, she was an actress.

680
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:12,374
You know what actresses
are like.

681
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,833
- No.

682
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,916
What are actresses like,
Lord Horbury?

683
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,916
- Well, um,

684
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:22,583
all things to all men,
in my experience.

685
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,249
I mean, she'd play the
country lady but to perfection,

686
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,416
until she got bored
with the part.

687
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:29,708
- So why do you come to me now,
Lord Horbury?

688
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,499
- Well, we've had the police
round already.

689
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:34,791
I don't know how they found out.

690
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:37,666
But they discovered
she knew the murdered woman.

691
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:39,874
- And do you believe
that this could have been

692
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:42,208
sufficient justification
for her to kill her?

693
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,083
- No.

694
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,999
As I said,
we don't get on.

695
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:50,791
We don't get on at all.

696
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:54,041
But, God, I know
what she's capable of.

697
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,166
And she's not capable of murder.

698
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:57,583
Never.

699
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,916
- We've been sitting here
watching his house

700
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,499
for an hour and a half.

701
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:13,999
He's never going to turn up.

702
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:16,458
- Monsieur Clancy will turn up
eventually, mademoiselle.

703
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,999
Have no fear.

704
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,583
- There he is.

705
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,166
- Do not forget the shorthand,
mademoiselle.

706
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,041
- But I told you
I don't do shorthand.

707
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,999
- Neither, I am sure,
does Monsieur Clancy.

708
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:45,458
Just make the little squiggles
with confidence.

709
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,624
It will unnerve him.

710
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,708
Monsieur Clancy, I confess,
I am at a loss.

711
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,999
I tried to deduce who is
the murderer of Madame Giselle,

712
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:16,291
but there are several suspects.

713
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:19,708
The little gray cells,
never do they let me down,

714
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,874
but in this case...

715
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,666
And so in despair,
I come to you.

716
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:27,041
- Why me?

717
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,458
- Because, Monsieur Clancy,
I'm a great admirer

718
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,708
of your detective
Monsieur Wilbraham Rice.

719
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,833
Such logic,
such a mind!

720
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,958
Indeed, Monsieur Clancy,

721
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,916
I have read everything
that you have written.

722
00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:46,833
Now, Mademoiselle Grey here
has agreed to assist me.

723
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,333
I know that you will have
some theory of your own

724
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:50,958
about who committed the murder.

725
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,916
If you would be so good
to tell it,

726
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:55,249
then Mademoiselle Grey
will take it down

727
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,749
so that I may absorb it later.

728
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,874
- I'm sorry.
No, it's impossible.

729
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,291
- Oh, come, come, come,
monsieur.

730
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,791
You are too modest.

731
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:07,083
- I'm useless
at this sort of thing.

732
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:08,833
Wilbraham does it, you see.

733
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,708
He works it all out for me.

734
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,999
He's quite brilliant.

735
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,499
He was helping me only just now
when I was out.

736
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:19,416
We were retracing the steps
of a murder.

737
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,083
Terrible stabbing.

738
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:24,374
- Monsieur Clancy, I am talking
about a real murder,

739
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:29,124
and one of the chief suspects
is yourself.

740
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:30,833
Oh, yes.

741
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,416
You had the opportunity,

742
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:35,083
and you were observed
to pass by Madame Giselle

743
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,958
during the flight.

744
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,874
- I deny it.

745
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,874
- But I saw you, Mr. Clancy.

746
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,833
You were carrying a book.

747
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,874
- Oh, yes, of course.

748
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,291
My Bradshaw.

749
00:50:57,584 --> 00:50:59,416
It gives the railway times.

750
00:50:59,709 --> 00:51:01,166
Wilbraham told me
to go and get it

751
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,458
to check the villain's alibi.

752
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,041
He was absolutely right.

753
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:06,333
Really cracked it.

754
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,666
I'd never have noticed it
myself.

755
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,833
- Perhaps Monsieur Rice
could solve another puzzle.

756
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,749
You told to me that you knew
of the South American Indians

757
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:18,958
and their poison darts

758
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,416
because of research
for one of your books.

759
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:23,416
Unfortunately, Monsieur Clancy,

760
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:24,916
there is no mention
of this subject

761
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,333
in any of your books.

762
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,833
But to my surprise,

763
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:32,291
what do I see on your shelf?

764
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,583
But this.

765
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:52,874
- With the powers invested in me
by the registrar of Paris,

766
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:55,874
I now declare you man and wife.

767
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:11,624
- Je dois aller à la police.
C'est très important.

768
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:14,916
Très vite.

769
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:18,958
- Entrez!

770
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:28,333
- Bonjour.

771
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,874
- Do you speak English?

772
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,583
- I do.
Why?

773
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,749
- You're in charge
of the Giselle case?

774
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:37,291
- Yes.

775
00:52:37,584 --> 00:52:39,083
- My name is Anne.

776
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,666
I'm Madame Giselle's daughter.

777
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:44,749
And I've come to claim
my inheritance.

778
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:10,333
- Ah.

779
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,583
Looking forward to the flight,
Poirot?

780
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,208
Gonna be a bit bumpy
they tell me.

781
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,791
Gale-force winds forecast
over the Channel.

782
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:19,791
- I have checked already,
Chief Inspector.

783
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:22,791
The air, it will be
beautifully calm all of the day.

784
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:25,583
Otherwise, I cancel my flight,
and you go on your own.

785
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,249
- Just a joke.

786
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:32,249
Anyway, I've been talking
to Lord and Lady Horbury again.

787
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,249
- I admire your industry,
Chief Inspector.

788
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,916
- And Venetia Kerr.

789
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:38,166
It's quite clear
that Lady Horbury

790
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:39,874
went off gambling
every night in Paris

791
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,833
and used to come back
in a terrible state.

792
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,249
But the morning
before they left,

793
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:45,458
she was particularly desperate.

794
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,458
- Which you assume is connected
with Madame Giselle.

795
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,958
And so we return to Paris
to see what else we can find

796
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,958
to finally incriminate
the Lady Horbury.

797
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,583
- Well, yes, that's what
we're going for, isn't it?

798
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,458
Or have you got
a completely different theory

799
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,041
you're not telling me about?

800
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:01,124
- I am reaching

801
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:05,124
certain conclusions,
Chief Inspector.

802
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:09,249
But conclusions which do not yet
fit together, unfortunately.

803
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:13,458
First, I conclude that the wasp
is of vital importance.

804
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,166
- Yes, but she wasn't killed
by the wasp.

805
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:17,166
Forensic have already
confirmed that.

806
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:19,124
- And secondly,
the sudden appearance

807
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:22,124
of the daughter
of Madame Giselle,

808
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:24,749
who we assume will inherit
the money of her mother.

809
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:27,541
- Unless they find a will
that says differently.

810
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,541
- Of course it is possible

811
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,083
that the daughter might be
an imposter.

812
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,458
Or perhaps Madame Giselle
did not even have a daughter.

813
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,416
- Sir?
- Ah.

814
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:39,208
- Would you care to order?

815
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,374
- Full English, please.

816
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,124
- If you please, madame,

817
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:31,041
may I have the use of your seat
just for one moment?

818
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,249
Thank you.

819
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:42,874
Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

820
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:53,416
- Thank you.

821
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:04,124
- What are you doing?

822
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:05,208
- Pardon?

823
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:07,083
- Where'd you get that?

824
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:09,416
- This?

825
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:10,833
From Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

826
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:13,999
It was in his house.

827
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,458
- That's evidence, Poirot.

828
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,916
- Alors, Chief Inspector,
may I present it to you?

829
00:56:22,209 --> 00:56:26,833
For myself, I have
no further use of it.

830
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:34,791
- I hope you're
not going to make

831
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:38,208
an exhibition of yourself here
like you did on that plane.

832
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:43,708
- But my experiments were
very useful, Chief Inspector.

833
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:48,291
They showed how dangerous
a woman is Lady Horbury.

834
00:56:48,584 --> 00:56:50,916
- Well, exactly.

835
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:53,999
- Et bien...

836
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:55,999
to be able to blow
the poison dart

837
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:58,499
from one end of the cabin
to the other?

838
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:01,666
First, she must have
a lot of puff.

839
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:03,874
Secondly...

840
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:08,249
her aim must be as good
as that of Fred Perry himself.

841
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,124
And finally,

842
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:12,124
she must have been able
to become invisible

843
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:16,374
so that no one on the plane
saw her do it.

844
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,124
I apologize, mon ami.

845
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:24,958
Poirot has gone too far?

846
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,041
- I'm surprised at you, Poirot,

847
00:57:27,334 --> 00:57:29,291
you of all people.

848
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:30,999
I mean, what we're talking
about here

849
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:33,666
is the psychological moment,
surely.

850
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,374
Whoever murdered Giselle,

851
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:38,166
whether it was Lady Horbury
or even Daniel Clancy,

852
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:41,124
clearly, they chose just
the psychological moment

853
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,666
when no one was looking,

854
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,499
so they could shoot the dart
from wherever they wanted.

855
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,708
- Psychology.

856
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,791
You are right, Chief Inspector.

857
00:57:56,084 --> 00:57:58,999
There must have been
the reason psychological

858
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,999
why no one on the plane
saw the murderer.

859
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,708
That is what we must discover.

860
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,708
But first, we must talk
to the daughter.

861
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,666
If the daughter is
what she really is.

862
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:16,916
- What do you mean she's gone?

863
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:19,374
- She arranged
to return here today

864
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:22,166
where I agreed we would take
further particulars.

865
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:26,166
She was in such a hurry before,
but she did not return.

866
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:27,916
- Well, let's go and find her,
Fournier.

867
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:30,958
How about that for a plan?

868
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,416
- That is the problem, you see.

869
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,083
I do not know where.

870
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,958
- You mean you didn't take
her address?

871
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,583
- No.

872
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:42,874
After all, she came to claim
her inheritance,

873
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:45,833
a very large amount of money
probably.

874
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,583
Why should she not return?

875
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,624
- Chief Inspector,
I would like it

876
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:53,624
that you stay and work
with Inspector Fournier,

877
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:54,708
if you please.

878
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,999
- Ha!

879
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,166
- Look, please do not be
difficult, Chief Inspector.

880
00:58:58,459 --> 00:58:59,999
We are in great need of the help
of the Sûreté.

881
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,999
- We just had their help.
Look where it's got us.

882
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,208
- Please, Chief Inspector, look.

883
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,583
You remember that I remove
from the wooden tube

884
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:07,958
a tiny piece of paper.

885
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,333
I have been studying it.
Observe it, if you please.

886
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:16,499
It has on it the letter F,

887
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:18,666
which I believe
stands for "francs."

888
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,499
It is, I think, the remains
of a price ticket

889
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:22,999
which has been torn off.

890
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:26,083
Therefore, the wooden tube,
it was purchased from a shop,

891
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:27,749
in Paris probably.

892
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:30,583
- I thought it came from
the South American Indians.

893
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,166
- No.

894
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:33,916
But now we have the need
to discover

895
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:35,541
where then is this shop?

896
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,374
And Inspector Fournier
and his men

897
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,624
will help you to find it.

898
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:41,208
- And what are you going to do?

899
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,541
- First, I must rest
the little gray cells.

900
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:48,791
And then I pursue the matter
of the disappearing daughter.

901
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,499
- On demande Madame de la Roche.

902
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:11,333
Paging Madame de la Roche.

903
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:15,083
On demande Madame de la Roche.

904
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:19,124
Paging Madame de la Roche.

905
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:21,416
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

906
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:26,624
Un homme a réservé
une chambre pour moi.

907
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:28,916
Il s'appelle Poirot.

908
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,333
- Ah, yes, of course.

909
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:31,916
Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

910
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:33,708
And you are Miss Grey.

911
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,708
- Yes.
Thank you.

912
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,833
- How do you do, Miss Grey?

913
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:41,416
- How do you do?
Mr. Dupont.

914
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:43,249
What a surprise.

915
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:44,874
Where are we going?

916
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,999
- I want to show you
some of the remarkable things

917
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:49,499
that archaeologists have in
the past unearthed, Miss Grey.

918
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,208
- Well, wait a minute.
This is ridiculous.

919
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,124
How did you know
where to find me, Mr. Dupont?

920
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,041
- It was easy.
I telephoned the airline.

921
01:00:55,334 --> 01:00:56,458
I said that I was your brother,

922
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,291
that I urgently needed
to contact you.

923
01:00:58,584 --> 01:00:59,416
- But why?

924
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:02,583
- Because I need your help.

925
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,541
- Have you ever dug up
anything like this?

926
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:18,249
- Not personally, no.

927
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,458
Not yet.

928
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,708
My father,
he was the expert.

929
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,374
He devoted his life to the study
of equatorial Africa.

930
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,249
Last year, he died.

931
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:29,124
So this year,
I plan an expedition there

932
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:30,499
to continue his work.

933
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:31,583
- What a good idea.

934
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:34,874
- Unfortunately,
I have no money.

935
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,749
I need money to fund
the expedition.

936
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,416
I look for private donations,

937
01:01:39,709 --> 01:01:42,833
but the average person,
it is terrible.

938
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:46,083
They care nothing
about primitive culture.

939
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,374
- Well, I hope you don't think
I've got any money.

940
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,624
I wish I had.

941
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,416
- No, no, it is not you,
Mademoiselle Grey.

942
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,333
It is the gentleman
with the mustaches,

943
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:55,958
Monsieur Poirot.

944
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,916
He is a man of style
and culture.

945
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:02,749
He has money, I think.

946
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,291
You know him well?

947
01:02:04,584 --> 01:02:06,999
- Not well, no.

948
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,208
No, hardly at all.

949
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,791
- Ah.

950
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:11,666
How unfortunate.

951
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:16,124
I wish to ask if you
would consider a small donation.

952
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:19,666
- Poirot?

953
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:21,708
Give money to the digging up
of Africa?

954
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,791
Mon Dieu.

955
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:26,499
Mm, perhaps that is not
such a bad idea.

956
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:30,541
Voilà.
We are here.

957
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,624
I will need your advice,
mademoiselle.

958
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:33,958
- Why?
How can I help?

959
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,708
- You are a daughter,
are you not?

960
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,708
We hear that Madame Giselle
had a daughter,

961
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,083
but perhaps this is wrong.

962
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:50,291
- This is an eerie place.

963
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:53,791
So cold and unfriendly.

964
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:56,083
Not what I would consider
a home.

965
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:59,749
I mean, there's nothing
personal in it.

966
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:02,458
Nothing at all.

967
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,374
- Mm, you are right.

968
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:08,333
S'il vous plaît?

969
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:12,124
There are no souvenirs,
no photographs,

970
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:16,999
no memories.

971
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,833
Est-ce que Madame Giselle
avait de la famille, Elise?

972
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,708
- Non, monsieur.

973
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,333
Ses parents sont morts.

974
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:24,749
- Morts?

975
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:27,291
What's she saying?
That someone's dead?

976
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:30,249
- Her mistress had no family.

977
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:33,708
Both her parents are dead.

978
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,874
Avaît-elle des enfants?

979
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:38,416
- Non, aucun.

980
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,499
- And there are no children?

981
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:42,958
- No.

982
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:47,124
Comme c'est curieux, Elise.

983
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:49,333
Une femme dont le nom
est Anne Giselle

984
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:53,041
vient de refaire surface.

985
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:56,541
- Anne?

986
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,166
Anne Giselle a refait surface?

987
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:00,833
- She knows the name.

988
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:05,208
So Anne Giselle does exist.

989
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,083
- Est-ce que Anne est la fille
de madame Giselle?

990
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:11,874
Oui.

991
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:18,624
C'était sa fille.
Illégitime.

992
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:24,624
J' ai dû prendre soin d'elle
pour madame,

993
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,583
jusqu'à ce qu'elle se sépare.

994
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,666
- Oh.

995
01:04:28,959 --> 01:04:34,666
- Il y a vingt-trois ans.
Je ne l'ai jamais revue depuis.

996
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,333
- The baby of Madame Giselle
was illegitimate

997
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:44,124
so that Elise
had to take care of her.

998
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,874
- What did she say,
something about 23 years ago?

999
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:50,958
- It is 23 years
that her mistress

1000
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,124
took the baby away from Elise,

1001
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:56,208
and she has not seen her since.

1002
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,624
- Attendez.

1003
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:08,374
Voilà.

1004
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:13,208
- Ah.
Merci.

1005
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,499
- Ah, Poirot.

1006
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,791
- Excusez-moi.

1007
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:23,374
- Went and tracked down the shop
that sold the dart.

1008
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:26,249
81 Porte de Clignancourt.

1009
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:28,833
Greek called Zeropoulos runs it.

1010
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,208
- Merveilleux.

1011
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,666
The efficiency
of the French police, no?

1012
01:05:34,959 --> 01:05:35,833
Regarde, mon ami.

1013
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:36,916
- What is it?

1014
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:37,958
- It is a photograph

1015
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,416
of the daughter
of Madame Giselle.

1016
01:05:39,709 --> 01:05:40,874
Ah, marvelous.

1017
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,541
Be a great help in tracing her,
that will.

1018
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:46,833
Hold on.
I've got some photos here.

1019
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,958
Excusez-moi.

1020
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:53,083
Have any of these people
ever been here?

1021
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,416
- Uh...

1022
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:58,666
Reconnaisez vous
quelqu'un, Elise?

1023
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,833
- Non.

1024
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,666
- Encore une question,
s'il vous plaît?

1025
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,083
Est-ce que vous avez reservé

1026
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,291
la place de Madame Giselle
sur le vol?

1027
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:08,999
- What are you asking?

1028
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:10,791
- Oui.

1029
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,624
- Alors, pourquoi
n'a-t-elle pas pris

1030
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:14,708
le vol de 9:00 du matin?

1031
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,541
- Il était plein.
Il n'y avait plus de place.

1032
01:06:18,834 --> 01:06:20,124
- I ask her why Madame Giselle

1033
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,624
did not take the morning flight
as was usual for her.

1034
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,124
- And why didn't she?

1035
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:26,249
- Because the 9:00 flight,
it was full, évidemment.

1036
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:27,666
There was no room on it.

1037
01:06:27,959 --> 01:06:29,666
- Well, you can't say fairer
than that, can you?

1038
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:31,583
- Qu'est-ce qui se passé, huh?

1039
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:34,458
- Ah, excusez-moi, madame.

1040
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:38,499
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ici?
Qu'est-ce qui se passe, huh?

1041
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:42,958
- Do you speak English?

1042
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,041
- Quoi?

1043
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,374
Qu'est-ce que vous dites, ah?

1044
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:46,833
- English?

1045
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,708
- Where's Cecily?

1046
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,958
- Oh, don't worry.

1047
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,624
She's in bed, fast asleep.

1048
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,791
- It's been nice being out
in the fresh air like this.

1049
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:18,374
- Just the two of us you mean?

1050
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,124
- Yes.

1051
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,208
Yes, I suppose I do.

1052
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,541
- Well, who knows?

1053
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:25,958
One day, well,
maybe things will be simpler.

1054
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,874
- If Cecily did
the decent thing you mean?

1055
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,083
- And what would
the decent thing be

1056
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,833
in your opinion, Venetia?

1057
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:36,041
- Well, if she confessed,
I suppose.

1058
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:39,041
Isn't that what we both want,
really, Stephen?

1059
01:07:57,459 --> 01:07:58,958
- Japp here.

1060
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,541
Yes, I know it's crackly.
I'm talking from France.

1061
01:08:02,834 --> 01:08:05,333
I want you to find
Lady Cecily Horbury at once.

1062
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,624
H-O-R,
B for Bertie,

1063
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:12,999
U-R-Y.

1064
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:14,374
Belgravia.

1065
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:18,541
Oh, yes, another place,
big house in Suffolk.

1066
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:22,374
Well, look it up in the file.

1067
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,958
And don't lose sight of her.

1068
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,874
What?

1069
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:28,333
Yes!

1070
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:32,458
And ring me back as soon as
you've traced her.

1071
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,208
Morning, Fournier.

1072
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,374
Sit down.

1073
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:43,083
So what have you
found out for me?

1074
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,333
- I've been to see

1075
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,874
Madame Giselle's lawyer,
Inspector.

1076
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,208
- Chief Inspector.

1077
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,708
- Uh, Chief Inspector.

1078
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,291
I've seen the will,
and it is true.

1079
01:08:54,584 --> 01:08:57,416
Madame Giselle left
her daughter, Anne Giselle,

1080
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:58,874
all her money,

1081
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,124
except for a small amount
for the maid,

1082
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:02,874
Elise Grandier.

1083
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,708
- I see.

1084
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,708
Thank you, Fournier.

1085
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:19,708
- That is correct.

1086
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,708
The 9:00 flight was full,

1087
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,874
so I booked Madame Giselle
on the midday flight.

1088
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:25,374
- How strange.

1089
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:27,541
- Why?
What's strange about it?

1090
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:29,791
Flights are often booked up
well in advance.

1091
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:32,583
- But not this one, monsieur.

1092
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,958
- What do you mean?

1093
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:38,749
- I'm an air stewardess.

1094
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,666
A colleague of mine was
on the 9:00 flight.

1095
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:43,833
She told me
it was virtually empty.

1096
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:52,541
- So perhaps you can now tell me
the truth, monsieur.

1097
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:54,124
- Well, it--

1098
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,291
Very well.

1099
01:09:58,584 --> 01:09:59,791
A man came in.

1100
01:10:00,084 --> 01:10:01,416
He gave me 4,000 francs

1101
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:03,541
to tell her the early plane
was full.

1102
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,291
There didn't seem to be
any harm in it.

1103
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:09,249
I didn't know
she was going to be murdered.

1104
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:12,208
- Describe this man,
s'il vous plaît.

1105
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,458
He was an American,

1106
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,291
tall, young,

1107
01:10:17,584 --> 01:10:20,833
with a goatee beard
and glasses.

1108
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,499
- Thank you.

1109
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:25,916
- Ah, yes.

1110
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:28,333
With glasses
and a hat.

1111
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:32,249
And he chewed gum
like all Americans.

1112
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:33,874
And his French accent,

1113
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:35,624
it was terrible.

1114
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,666
- Of course.
Bon.

1115
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:39,083
- Look.

1116
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,791
I will show you the tray
where I keep the wooden pipes.

1117
01:10:43,084 --> 01:10:45,499
The junk tray I call it.

1118
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:49,874
I keep it for all the Americans.

1119
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,541
No, no, no, no.

1120
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,416
I bring it to you.

1121
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:55,999
Enjoy the sun.

1122
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:57,416
- Merci.

1123
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,083
- But there wasn't
an American on board.

1124
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,666
So where'd he come from?

1125
01:11:08,959 --> 01:11:10,166
- Mademoiselle,

1126
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:13,708
you have helped me
very, very much.

1127
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,833
I thank you.

1128
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,208
- Well, I haven't done much.

1129
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,749
- Oh, yes, already you are like
a true professional.

1130
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,749
With the young man
at airline office,

1131
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,624
you played your role
but to perfection.

1132
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:28,999
Ah!
The wooden tube.

1133
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:30,124
May I?

1134
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:33,541
- Oui, oui.

1135
01:11:33,834 --> 01:11:35,374
- C'est jolie, n'est-ce pas?

1136
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,624
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est?

1137
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:44,833
Ah.

1138
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:50,874
The little pieces of silk,
such workmanship.

1139
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,999
What else do you observe,
mademoiselle?

1140
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:55,499
- Well, the silk is red.

1141
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:58,291
I thought the dart
that killed Madame Giselle

1142
01:11:58,584 --> 01:11:59,666
had black and yellow on it.

1143
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:02,249
- But you see, the murderer,

1144
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:05,666
he replaced the red silk
with the black and yellow.

1145
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:10,458
You seem to be in a hurry,
mademoiselle.

1146
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,208
- Oh, not really.

1147
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,249
Well, Norman--Mr. Gale--
said he might call.

1148
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,291
He thought he might come over
for a couple of days.

1149
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:18,583
- I see.

1150
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,874
Um, Mademoiselle Grey,
I've been thinking.

1151
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:22,916
I have been thinking very hard.

1152
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:24,708
I wish that you say
to Monsieur Dupont

1153
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,416
that Poirot is very happy
to give to him

1154
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:29,499
for his expedition
the sum of £500.

1155
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:30,916
- £500?

1156
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:32,083
- Oui.

1157
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:33,874
- That's extremely kind.

1158
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:35,041
- But of course.

1159
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:41,374
- À la préfecture de police,
s'il vous plaît.

1160
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:49,833
- What if that woman
Fournier let slip

1161
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:51,749
is not the real daughter,
Poirot?

1162
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,208
- Who else do we know

1163
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,999
who is of an age
that would be correct

1164
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:56,583
for the daughter
of Madame Giselle?

1165
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:57,749
I tell you.

1166
01:12:58,042 --> 01:12:59,541
We know three women:

1167
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,333
the honorable Venetia Kerr,
Mademoiselle Jane Grey,

1168
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:03,999
and the Lady Horbury.

1169
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:05,666
All three were on the airplane.

1170
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:07,416
- Well, I'd still plug
for Lady Horbury.

1171
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:08,708
- But why, Chief Inspector?

1172
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,916
- Well, for one thing,

1173
01:13:10,209 --> 01:13:11,541
because that concierge
at Giselle's

1174
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,624
finally admitted
that she recognized her.

1175
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:14,833
- She told you this?

1176
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,499
- Said she'd been there
several times.

1177
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,374
The last time, she stormed out,
slamming the door behind her.

1178
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,499
- You discovered all this while
knowing virtually no French?

1179
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:24,416
Chief Inspector,
you're a miracle.

1180
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:26,416
- Well, a bit of ingenuity,

1181
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:29,499
expressive hand gestures,
that sort of thing.

1182
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:33,666
- Thank you.

1183
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:36,624
We make progress, Fournier.

1184
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,083
Chief Inspector Japp believes

1185
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,666
that Lady Horbury
committed the murder.

1186
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:42,291
Whereas I,
I have discovered

1187
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,166
that the purchaser
of the poison dart was a man.

1188
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:46,249
- It can't have been.

1189
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:47,833
- Mais oui.
An American.

1190
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,624
Or he seems to be.

1191
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:50,916
He chews gum.

1192
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,624
He wears American spectacles

1193
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:55,874
and speaks with a most terrible
French accent.

1194
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,583
But it is easy to be
an American in Paris,

1195
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:58,958
n'est-ce pas, Fournier?

1196
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,374
- Mais oui, certainement.

1197
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:02,708
- So I suggest that he is
a stage American.

1198
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,624
- You mean it was a disguise?

1199
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:06,791
- Mm.

1200
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:09,541
- So it cannot be Lady Horbury.

1201
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,833
- Unless she has an accomplice.

1202
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:19,083
Now, that is possible.

1203
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,624
- Wasn't there some gossip
about her in the newspapers?

1204
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:26,874
About her having
an actor friend.

1205
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:30,916
- Not in the newspapers
that I read, Chief Inspector.

1206
01:14:31,209 --> 01:14:32,791
But you may be right.

1207
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:38,916
- Japp here.

1208
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:40,499
What?

1209
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,833
What do you mean?

1210
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,374
Well, where is she?

1211
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,916
Wonderful.

1212
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:53,208
I put a couple of men
onto Lady Horbury.

1213
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,833
But it seems they were too late.

1214
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,124
They've missed her.

1215
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:58,666
No one knows where she is.

1216
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:00,249
She's vanished.

1217
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,541
- Oh, dear.

1218
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:06,958
So you have now a lost suspect
too, Chief Inspector?

1219
01:15:32,459 --> 01:15:35,166
- So...now I leave you,
mademoiselle.

1220
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:37,708
- But aren't you going to say
hello to Norman?

1221
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,541
- Uh...

1222
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:45,541
In such a situation, three is
a considerable crowd, I think.

1223
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,499
Excuse me.

1224
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,666
Monsieur Mitchell, is it not?

1225
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:24,124
- Oh, of course.
Mr. Poirot.

1226
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,208
- Oui.
May I, please?

1227
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,541
- Please do.

1228
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:29,791
- Thank you.

1229
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,666
No more murders I hope,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1230
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:40,999
- No.

1231
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:42,708
- Bon.

1232
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,291
Bon.

1233
01:16:58,375 --> 01:16:59,291
You know it is truly fortunate

1234
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:01,166
to meet you here,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1235
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:03,874
I have a question to ask you.

1236
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:07,791
When you cleared the table of
Madame Giselle after she died,

1237
01:17:08,084 --> 01:17:10,083
did you notice anything unusual?

1238
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,083
- No.
No, I don't think so.

1239
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,458
What sort of thing?

1240
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,083
- Anything, anything at all.

1241
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:21,083
Think hard, please.
It is very important.

1242
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,833
- Well, yes,
there was something.

1243
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,124
It's silly, I'm sure,
but, um...

1244
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:27,041
there were two coffee spoons
in her saucer.

1245
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:28,958
It can sometimes happen
when you're in a rush,

1246
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,374
and it's better to lay too much
than too little.

1247
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:33,958
People can get
terribly irritable

1248
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,083
if everything
isn't exactly right.

1249
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:40,416
Still, that's not
what you're after.

1250
01:17:42,459 --> 01:17:44,999
Au contraire,
Monsieur Mitchell.

1251
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:46,791
Thank you very much.

1252
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:50,208
It is a clue
of the most vital importance.

1253
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,291
- It's so nice to be able
to spend time together in Paris.

1254
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:07,833
- Yes, it is.

1255
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,624
And I'll be fascinated to see
where the old woman lived.

1256
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:13,916
Anyway, why do you think Poirot

1257
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:16,083
suddenly agreed to give Dupont
the money?

1258
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,083
- I don't know.

1259
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,166
Why?
Do you think it's odd?

1260
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,291
Do you think he's worked out
some theory?

1261
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:27,208
- What, that Jean Dupont
murdered Giselle?

1262
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,208
Do you believe
he could have done it?

1263
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,458
- I don't know.

1264
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,416
He's a bit funny.

1265
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,708
But he seemed quite nice to me.

1266
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,041
- How nice?

1267
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:38,124
- Not that nice.

1268
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:40,083
This is her house.

1269
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:44,541
We're being watched.

1270
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,624
- Hello?

1271
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,374
- Oh.

1272
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:08,791
I...was looking
for Inspector Fournier.

1273
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:10,499
- How can we help you,
mademoiselle?

1274
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:11,666
- Madame.

1275
01:19:11,959 --> 01:19:14,874
- Madame.
Pardon.

1276
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,708
- Well, I've come to apologize.

1277
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,833
You see, I came to see
Inspector Fournier...

1278
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,708
a little while ago...

1279
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,541
about a rather important matter.

1280
01:19:25,834 --> 01:19:27,208
- You're Madame Giselle's
daughter?

1281
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,291
- Yes.

1282
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:32,541
- Please.
Sit down, madame.

1283
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:43,291
- It's unforgivable, I know.

1284
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:45,624
But I was
in such a frantic state.

1285
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:48,708
You see, I only read
about her death

1286
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,666
the day I was going
to get married.

1287
01:19:50,959 --> 01:19:53,083
The minute the ceremony
was finished,

1288
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,041
I hurried over here.

1289
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:57,666
And then I wished I hadn't.

1290
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,583
I felt awful
about my poor husband

1291
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,416
just waiting for me.

1292
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,208
And we couldn't possibly cancel
the honeymoon.

1293
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,041
So I just didn't come back.

1294
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:10,166
- Until now when the honeymoon
has finished?

1295
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:11,958
- Yes.

1296
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,749
- Do you have any idea

1297
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,208
of the trouble you've caused,
Mrs...

1298
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,833
- Richards.

1299
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,541
- I think we need a few facts.

1300
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:21,999
For a start, how do we know
you're who you say you are?

1301
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:23,333
- I thought of that.

1302
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:25,874
I brought you
my birth certificate.

1303
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:37,833
- Do I not know you, madame?

1304
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:41,999
There is something about you
that I seem to recognize.

1305
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:44,333
- I don't see how.

1306
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,833
I was brought up in Toronto

1307
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:50,249
after my mother abandoned me.

1308
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:51,708
Do you know Canada?

1309
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,791
- Alas, no.

1310
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:57,624
- Were you ever in contact
with your mother, Mrs. Richards?

1311
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:58,708
- Not at all.

1312
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:02,583
She never came to Canada
to see me.

1313
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:04,583
She never wrote to me.

1314
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:07,458
She obviously didn't care
at all about me.

1315
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,499
- And naturally,
you hated her for this.

1316
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:11,916
- I didn't care.

1317
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:13,624
That's all.

1318
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:15,708
Why should I?

1319
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,416
I just hope she's left me
a lot of money.

1320
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:30,708
- Trente-six rouge.

1321
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:35,916
Faites vos jeux,
mesdames et messieurs.

1322
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:37,124
Faites vos jeux.

1323
01:21:37,417 --> 01:21:38,958
- What's the matter?

1324
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,708
- Nothing.

1325
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,624
What's money, after all?

1326
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,374
Get me another drink, Raymond.

1327
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:56,708
- Ah, is this the newspaper

1328
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,374
that you tell me about,
Chief Inspector?

1329
01:21:58,667 --> 01:21:59,958
The one that reveres the gossip

1330
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,208
of the English upper classes
and their friends?

1331
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,041
- Yes, and it's very difficult
to get over here.

1332
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:07,833
- So I see.
The date is yesterday.

1333
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,583
Here, mon ami,
the newspaper of today.

1334
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:14,416
- Well, thanks.

1335
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:19,166
It's in French, Poirot.

1336
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:20,999
Struth, there's Lady Horbury.

1337
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:23,291
- She disappears
from her home in England

1338
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:26,291
only to reappear here in Paris
under our very noses.

1339
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:27,833
"With...

1340
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:31,124
Let me translate for you,
Chief Inspector.

1341
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:33,749
"With her traveling companion,

1342
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:38,333
the well-known British actor
Mr. Raymond Barraclough..."

1343
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,624
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1344
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:43,708
Poirot has a plan.

1345
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:48,999
- Is that all right?

1346
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:50,083
- No.

1347
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:52,124
It is terrible.

1348
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:53,624
Regardez.

1349
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:55,374
- Well, she won't be able
to recognize me.

1350
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:56,833
That's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

1351
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:58,249
- Yes, but I did not intend

1352
01:22:58,542 --> 01:23:00,458
that you should look
like Santa Claus.

1353
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,124
Come, Monsieur Gale,
into the next room

1354
01:23:02,417 --> 01:23:06,208
and sit in that chair,
if you please.

1355
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,458
Mademoiselle Grey,
if you would be so kind

1356
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,583
as to hold the mirror.

1357
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:14,958
And, Monsieur,
if you will hold the towel.

1358
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,624
Et bien, do not worry.

1359
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:24,124
Hercule Poirot will make you
look like a human being again.

1360
01:23:40,584 --> 01:23:41,499
- Lady Horbury.

1361
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:43,041
Daily Record,
Paris correspondent.

1362
01:23:43,334 --> 01:23:44,374
I'm sorry to bother you,

1363
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:46,041
but we'd really like to do
a piece on you

1364
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:47,749
for our series,
The English in Paris.

1365
01:23:48,042 --> 01:23:48,833
- No, certainly not.

1366
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,208
- No, really, Lady Horbury.

1367
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,124
The photographer will be here
in just a second.

1368
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,499
Just a photo of yourself
and Mr. Barraclough here.

1369
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:55,916
- How dare you.

1370
01:23:56,209 --> 01:23:57,624
Get away from us!

1371
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:02,166
- Now, I really don't think you
should be taking that attitude.

1372
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:06,708
But we'll be here again
tomorrow morning, Lady Horbury.

1373
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,708
I can see we've got
an excellent story here already.

1374
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:14,874
- Now look what you've done.

1375
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:16,333
- I'm sorry.

1376
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:18,708
- Just leave me alone.
You're pathetic.

1377
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,666
- Ah, Lady Horbury, bonjour.

1378
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:40,833
You care to join me?

1379
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,458
May I get you something,
a coffee perhaps?

1380
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,541
- No.

1381
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:51,874
Thank you.
I'm all right.

1382
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:58,291
- A cigarette perhaps?

1383
01:24:58,584 --> 01:25:01,124
- Thank you.

1384
01:25:14,834 --> 01:25:17,374
- There is something perhaps
you would like to tell Poirot?

1385
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:19,083
And then he can help?

1386
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:21,833
- No, it's nothing, really.

1387
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,166
- But I think that is not so.

1388
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,874
On the day before the murder,

1389
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:32,666
your good friend,
Monsieur Barraclough,

1390
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:34,666
he was in Paris?

1391
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:35,999
- Yes.

1392
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:39,708
- And you saw him
while you were in Paris?

1393
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,291
And you also saw Madame Giselle,
did you not?

1394
01:25:42,584 --> 01:25:46,374
And she refused to release you
from your gambling debts.

1395
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:57,083
- I didn't know what to do.

1396
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,999
Stephen wouldn't pay them.

1397
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,083
I knew he wouldn't,
not anymore.

1398
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,999
They were enormous.

1399
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:08,624
Much more than he imagined.

1400
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,624
She threatened me.

1401
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:18,791
She said she'd tell people
about them...

1402
01:26:19,084 --> 01:26:22,374
people in London.

1403
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:25,833
I'd never have been able
to hold my head up again.

1404
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,916
- So the truth is

1405
01:26:30,209 --> 01:26:31,749
that you
and Monsieur Barraclough

1406
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:33,458
were delighted when she died?

1407
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,749
- Yes.

1408
01:26:36,042 --> 01:26:38,291
It was wonderful...

1409
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:44,999
Almost too wonderful to believe.

1410
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,499
- Ah, Poirot.

1411
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,041
- Chief Inspector.
Mademoiselle.

1412
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:15,416
- Well, did you find out
what you wanted?

1413
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:16,708
- Yes.

1414
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,208
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

1415
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,208
- Anyway, I must go.

1416
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,624
Ah, my nail.

1417
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:35,083
I must file it.

1418
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:40,458
- What did you say,
mademoiselle?

1419
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,708
- What?

1420
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,374
Oh, my nail.

1421
01:27:44,667 --> 01:27:47,958
It's nothing.
It needs filing.

1422
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:50,541
- Nom de nom de nom.

1423
01:27:50,834 --> 01:27:52,624
Now I understand.

1424
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:54,666
Chief Inspector,

1425
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:55,958
get a taxi at once.

1426
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,499
Unless I am very much mistaken,

1427
01:27:57,792 --> 01:28:01,666
Madame Richards,
she is in great danger.

1428
01:28:36,959 --> 01:28:39,541
- She left about an hour ago
with an American.

1429
01:28:39,834 --> 01:28:41,416
She seemed surprised to see him.

1430
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:43,541
- And where did they go, madame?
Can you tell us that?

1431
01:28:43,834 --> 01:28:44,749
- Oh, yes.

1432
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:46,499
He ordered a taxi
for the Gare du Nord.

1433
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:48,249
They were going to England.

1434
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:49,416
I heard him tell her.

1435
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,499
- May I use your phone, ma'am?

1436
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:34,041
- Madame?

1437
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:37,916
- Suicide?

1438
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:40,416
- That is what the police
suspect, Monsieur Gale.

1439
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:41,874
- That's terrible.
- Oui.

1440
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:44,791
- What about her husband?
Has he been told?

1441
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:46,874
- I believe the police
have been unable

1442
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:50,333
to trace the whereabouts
of Monsieur Richards...so far.

1443
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:52,374
- Is there anything
we can do to help?

1444
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:55,499
- I regret that it is too late
for anyone to help the daughter

1445
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:58,124
of Madame Giselle.

1446
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:01,041
However, if you both
would be so kind,

1447
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:02,916
there is something
you could do to help.

1448
01:30:03,209 --> 01:30:05,916
Please join me in my suite,

1449
01:30:06,209 --> 01:30:07,249
as I have called together

1450
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:09,958
all those I consider relevant
to this case.

1451
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,791
- Why?
Surely, you don't think--

1452
01:30:13,084 --> 01:30:14,374
- Mademoiselle,

1453
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:19,958
I think only of apprehending
the murderer of Madame Giselle.

1454
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:22,541
I hope you
only think of that also.

1455
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,833
Mesdames et messieurs,

1456
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,874
first, I have the task

1457
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:43,624
to restore the reputation
of Hercule Poirot,

1458
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:45,583
the celebrated detective

1459
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,499
who had the misfortune
not to observe

1460
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:49,416
the cunning murder
of Madame Marie Giselle

1461
01:30:49,709 --> 01:30:52,374
even though it took place
not ten meters away from him.

1462
01:30:55,084 --> 01:30:58,541
And so...

1463
01:30:58,834 --> 01:31:01,541
when I had the dubious pleasure

1464
01:31:01,834 --> 01:31:04,833
to attend the final
of the tennis match,

1465
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:08,666
I observed an incident
between you, Lady Horbury,

1466
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:11,708
and Madame Giselle.

1467
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,374
It seemed to me quite clear
that she had some hold of you...

1468
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:18,166
- No more money,
comprenez?

1469
01:31:18,459 --> 01:31:21,374
- A hold that you might go
to any lengths to be rid of.

1470
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:24,416
- Oh, now, that is outrageous.

1471
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:26,458
Cicely would never be involved--

1472
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,624
- Monsieur Raymond Barraclough,

1473
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,624
you are, I understand, an actor?

1474
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:34,666
A profession that I think
would equip you very well

1475
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:37,333
for the impersonation
of the mysterious American

1476
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:40,124
who seems to have been
the accomplice of the murderer.

1477
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,791
- And how are we supposed to
have carried out this murder?

1478
01:31:43,084 --> 01:31:45,041
- Well, as for opportunity,

1479
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,374
the wooden tube was hidden

1480
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:51,416
in the gap next to your seat
on the plane.

1481
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:54,541
But as my experiments proved
most conclusively,

1482
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:55,916
it would have been impossible

1483
01:31:56,209 --> 01:31:57,916
for anyone to have blown
the dart on the plane

1484
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:01,166
without the greatest risk
of being seen.

1485
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:06,708
And so we ask ourselves
this question.

1486
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:12,583
why was the wooden tube
hidden in such a place

1487
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:15,541
where it would undoubtedly
have been found?

1488
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:17,749
- To mislead us.

1489
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:20,999
- Vraiment,
Chief Inspector.

1490
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:25,541
So next, we come to the wasp.

1491
01:32:25,834 --> 01:32:27,999
What was the purpose
of the wasp?

1492
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:29,499
- The same thing.

1493
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:30,791
To mislead us as well.

1494
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:33,958
- Thank you, Mademoiselle Grey.

1495
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,166
You know, Mademoiselle Grey

1496
01:32:35,459 --> 01:32:36,666
has been such a help to me
throughout.

1497
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:38,499
Une parfaite assistante.

1498
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:41,249
And she is right.

1499
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:44,916
But by the time the body of
Madame Giselle was discovered,

1500
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,958
the wasp,
it was dead also,

1501
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,499
because it had been killed...

1502
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:52,416
by Monsieur Dupont.

1503
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:54,916
- It was buzzing
around my coffee.

1504
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:57,124
- But did you
have to kill it, sir?

1505
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:59,291
Was that really necessary?

1506
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:00,624
What?

1507
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:02,458
Are you saying
that because I killed a wasp,

1508
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,083
I also killed Madame Giselle?

1509
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:08,499
That is ridiculous.

1510
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,999
- If the wasp was put there
to mislead us,

1511
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:16,458
was there not also a danger
of it failing to do so?

1512
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,041
Unless, of course, our attention
was drawn to it

1513
01:33:19,334 --> 01:33:21,083
by the murderer himself.

1514
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:23,458
- It's a wasp sting.

1515
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,999
I killed a wasp with my cup.

1516
01:33:27,292 --> 01:33:30,458
All I did was kill a wasp
with my cup.

1517
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:31,958
- However,
mesdames et messieurs,

1518
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,166
we know that the murder,

1519
01:33:33,459 --> 01:33:35,333
it was not committed
by the wasp.

1520
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,874
And we know
that it was not committed

1521
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:38,208
by the use of the wooden tube.

1522
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,749
No.

1523
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:43,583
It was committed
by the poison dart being pushed

1524
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:48,624
into the neck of Madame Giselle
by the hand.

1525
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:52,583
Now, we know
of only three people

1526
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:55,041
who passed by Madame Giselle
during the flight:

1527
01:33:55,334 --> 01:33:56,333
the two air stewards,

1528
01:33:56,625 --> 01:34:00,333
Monsieur Mitchell
and Mademoiselle Jane Grey;

1529
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,208
and Monsieur Daniel Clancy.

1530
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,749
- Oh, I really--
I didn't come all this way to--

1531
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:08,666
- So why did you come
all this way, Mr. Clancy?

1532
01:34:08,959 --> 01:34:11,624
Because it would have been
too suspicious to have refused?

1533
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:13,666
- How dare you!

1534
01:34:13,959 --> 01:34:16,166
- Monsieur Clancy displayed
an expert knowledge

1535
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:17,749
of the murder weapon.

1536
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:20,916
- Goodness, it's a dart.

1537
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:22,958
Native dart.

1538
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,416
- And in his house,

1539
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:27,583
I found a wooden tube
very similar

1540
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:31,291
to the one we discovered
on the plane.

1541
01:34:31,584 --> 01:34:32,416
- I told you,

1542
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:35,041
it was for research for a book.

1543
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:37,333
- For a book that you
never wrote, Monsieur Clancy.

1544
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:39,583
- Because Wilbraham
wouldn't let me.

1545
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:45,749
He thought the whole idea
preposterous.

1546
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,416
How can I write
a detective story

1547
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:54,124
when my detective refuses
to take any part in it?

1548
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:56,541
- What's he talking about?

1549
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:58,624
- I feel that Monsieur Clancy
suffers from a malady

1550
01:34:58,917 --> 01:35:00,083
common to many writers
of fiction.

1551
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,624
His characters,
they take control.

1552
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:04,333
At times, they appear to him
more real

1553
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:05,999
than the world around him.

1554
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:09,916
- You mean he's a madman.

1555
01:35:10,209 --> 01:35:11,749
A murdering madman.

1556
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:13,583
Keep him away from me.

1557
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,541
- Please, Lady Horbury,

1558
01:35:17,834 --> 01:35:19,583
rest calm.

1559
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:23,749
Now, as for
the two air stewards,

1560
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:26,041
I have already discounted
Monsieur Mitchell.

1561
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:28,333
- Well, that only seems
to leave you, Miss Grey.

1562
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:29,958
Wouldn't you say?

1563
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,374
- Now, look, I'm sorry.

1564
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:33,041
I protest.

1565
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:35,291
This is past a joke.

1566
01:35:35,584 --> 01:35:36,583
- No.

1567
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:39,999
It's all right, Norman.

1568
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,041
- I was indeed suspicious
of Mademoiselle Grey.

1569
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:49,208
I was suspicious
of her new friendship

1570
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,499
with Monsieur Gale.

1571
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:53,749
Was this friendship really new?

1572
01:35:54,042 --> 01:35:59,916
Or was she the true daughter
of Madame Giselle?

1573
01:36:00,209 --> 01:36:04,208
But then, of course, at last,
we met the real daughter

1574
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,416
of Madame Giselle.

1575
01:36:07,709 --> 01:36:09,874
As soon as she entered
the room...

1576
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,041
- I...was looking
for Inspector Fournier.

1577
01:36:12,334 --> 01:36:14,833
- I was convinced

1578
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:17,999
I had seen this lady
somewhere before.

1579
01:36:19,959 --> 01:36:21,666
It was not until
Mademoiselle Grey

1580
01:36:21,959 --> 01:36:26,416
caught her nail
that I remembered.

1581
01:36:26,709 --> 01:36:28,333
- Oh, my nail.

1582
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:29,791
I must file it.

1583
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,374
- In the lobby of the hotel,

1584
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,708
when I first saw Lady Horbury,

1585
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,541
she was accompanied by her maid.

1586
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:38,208
- Fetch my cigarettes, will you?

1587
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,083
- Yes, Lady Horbury.

1588
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:42,833
- On the plane when she
called out for the nail file,

1589
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:45,708
it was brought to her
by this same maid,

1590
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,541
a lady
that we later came to know

1591
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:51,583
as Anne Giselle.

1592
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,541
- I've come to claim
my inheritance.

1593
01:36:54,834 --> 01:36:57,124
- This is all very ingenious,

1594
01:36:57,417 --> 01:37:00,166
but I'm afraid Monsieur Poirot
doesn't really mean it.

1595
01:37:00,459 --> 01:37:02,541
He keeps deliberately changing
his story.

1596
01:37:02,834 --> 01:37:05,833
First, poor Jane killed Giselle.

1597
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:08,416
And now her daughter did.

1598
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:09,583
- No, no, no, Monsieur Gale,

1599
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:11,291
the daughter
did not kill the mother.

1600
01:37:11,584 --> 01:37:12,749
The maid of Lady Horbury,

1601
01:37:13,042 --> 01:37:15,124
she left the first-class cabin
at the start of the flight,

1602
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:16,958
and we know that Madame Giselle

1603
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,666
did not die
until shortly before we landed.

1604
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:23,249
- Then how...did she die?

1605
01:37:23,542 --> 01:37:25,583
- Hmm.

1606
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:28,208
You will recall, Monsieur Gale,

1607
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,791
that I asked you
to disguise yourself

1608
01:37:30,084 --> 01:37:31,874
as a reporter
to go to see Lady Horbury.

1609
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,083
- We'd really like to do a piece
on you for our series...

1610
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,499
- What, he was--

1611
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:38,291
- I apologize for the deceit,
madame.

1612
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:41,833
But you know, at first,
the disguise of Monsieur Gale,

1613
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:45,791
it was hopelessly
unconvincing, huh?

1614
01:37:46,084 --> 01:37:49,583
But why?

1615
01:37:49,875 --> 01:37:52,416
Why was the disguise
of Monsieur Gale

1616
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:57,083
so unconvincing?

1617
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,708
There are two reasons for this.

1618
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,999
First, to make me believe
that it would be impossible

1619
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:05,791
for him to impersonate
the mysterious American;

1620
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:07,541
and secondly,

1621
01:38:07,834 --> 01:38:12,041
and most important of all,

1622
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:15,791
to ensure that I would
never learn the truth

1623
01:38:16,084 --> 01:38:18,208
about how this murder
was committed.

1624
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:28,624
You see,

1625
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:30,541
in the list
of the personal belongings

1626
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:32,166
of Monsieur Gale,

1627
01:38:32,459 --> 01:38:33,541
I had already noticed

1628
01:38:33,834 --> 01:38:37,333
that he was traveling
with his dentist's coat.

1629
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:40,708
During the flight,
when coffee had been served

1630
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,249
and the air stewards were
in another part of the plane,

1631
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:48,083
Monsieur Gale makes the visit
to the toilettes.

1632
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:52,124
He changes
into his dentist's coat

1633
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:53,458
and alters his appearance

1634
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:55,041
with the help
of some cotton wool

1635
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:57,166
which he had brought
for the purpose.

1636
01:39:02,417 --> 01:39:04,416
He picks up a spoon,

1637
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:07,374
which gives him the task
of a steward to carry out,

1638
01:39:07,667 --> 01:39:11,541
and hurries down the corridor
of the plane.

1639
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:14,166
He then pushes the poison thorn

1640
01:39:14,459 --> 01:39:19,708
into the neck
of Madame Marie Giselle.

1641
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,291
On his way back,
while I was asleep,

1642
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:29,166
he put the wooden tube
into the seat in front of mine.

1643
01:39:29,459 --> 01:39:31,999
He then returned
to the toilettes

1644
01:39:32,292 --> 01:39:37,708
and removed his disguise.

1645
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,374
- Very good.

1646
01:39:39,667 --> 01:39:44,416
Very good, Monsieur Poirot.

1647
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:46,833
You have thrown
the real murderer

1648
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:48,791
completely off his guard.

1649
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:50,374
Now...

1650
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:55,333
could we have the real solution,
please?

1651
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:56,999
- I think you will find,
Monsieur Gale,

1652
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:59,333
that the truth
of how this crime began

1653
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:03,416
is even more intriguing.

1654
01:40:03,709 --> 01:40:04,958
Anne Giselle hated her mother

1655
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,416
for abandoning her
when she was a baby.

1656
01:40:07,709 --> 01:40:09,166
She was brought up in Canada

1657
01:40:09,459 --> 01:40:12,041
and came to England
to work as a maid.

1658
01:40:12,334 --> 01:40:14,499
By coincidence,

1659
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:17,999
she came into the employment
of Lady Horbury

1660
01:40:18,292 --> 01:40:20,916
and began to move
into the high society.

1661
01:40:21,209 --> 01:40:24,791
Despite your humble profession,
Monsieur Gale,

1662
01:40:25,084 --> 01:40:28,458
you aspired yourself
to this society.

1663
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,499
And no doubt,
it was on one such occasion

1664
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:34,958
that you met the maid
of Lady Horbury.

1665
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:38,791
Your...relationship?

1666
01:40:39,084 --> 01:40:40,374
It developed,

1667
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:45,166
until one day, this same maid
told to you her secret.

1668
01:40:45,459 --> 01:40:47,541
She pointed out to you
her mother

1669
01:40:47,834 --> 01:40:51,874
and told you of the power
she had over Lady Horbury.

1670
01:40:57,834 --> 01:41:00,499
Of course, after 23 years,

1671
01:41:00,792 --> 01:41:03,624
Madame Giselle did not recognize
her daughter.

1672
01:41:03,917 --> 01:41:05,124
And luckily for you,

1673
01:41:05,417 --> 01:41:07,458
her daughter
hated her mother so much

1674
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:11,083
that she willingly agreed
to your plan...

1675
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,374
to murder her in such a way

1676
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:21,374
that Lady Horbury
would be blamed.

1677
01:41:21,667 --> 01:41:22,916
- He planned all that?

1678
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:25,583
I could've--

1679
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:27,583
I mean, the police very nearly--

1680
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:30,166
- With Madame Giselle dead,
it was essential

1681
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:33,333
that Monsieur Gale should
now be married to the daughter.

1682
01:41:33,625 --> 01:41:35,499
Anne would claim
her inheritance,

1683
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:37,458
but in the event of her death,

1684
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:41,666
her husband would receive
the wealth of Madame Giselle.

1685
01:41:41,959 --> 01:41:43,916
But then Monsieur Gale learned
that I had met Anne

1686
01:41:44,209 --> 01:41:48,916
in the office
of Inspector Fournier.

1687
01:41:49,209 --> 01:41:50,708
- He ordered a taxi
for the Gare du Nord.

1688
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,833
- He was terrified
that I might discover

1689
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:56,124
that also she was the maid.

1690
01:42:23,334 --> 01:42:25,666
- Madame?

1691
01:42:25,959 --> 01:42:27,749
- The poor woman's death
was suicide.

1692
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:28,874
You told me.

1693
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:30,583
- No, no, no, no, no,
Monsieur Gale.

1694
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:32,166
You see, you left
your fingerprints

1695
01:42:32,459 --> 01:42:33,624
on the poison bottle.

1696
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:36,083
- Now, that's absolutely
ridiculous because I wore--

1697
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:41,958
- You wore the gloves
when you committed the murder?

1698
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:45,458
Indeed.

1699
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:48,374
Thank you.

1700
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:10,041
- You better come along
with me, sir.

1701
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:11,833
- Why?

1702
01:43:12,125 --> 01:43:14,291
Why did you do it, Norman?

1703
01:43:14,584 --> 01:43:16,416
- For the money, Jane.

1704
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:19,583
For a very great deal of money.

1705
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:22,958
Why else?

1706
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:57,291
- I thought...

1707
01:43:57,584 --> 01:44:00,541
I don't know.

1708
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,999
- You liked Monsieur Gale?

1709
01:44:03,292 --> 01:44:05,083
- Yes.

1710
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:08,541
- And you thought
that he liked you?

1711
01:44:08,834 --> 01:44:11,833
But you are wrong,
mademoiselle.

1712
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:13,416
- Obviously.

1713
01:44:13,709 --> 01:44:15,958
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1714
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,416
He did not like you.

1715
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:21,624
He loved you.

1716
01:44:21,917 --> 01:44:24,083
It is true.

1717
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:27,374
I see it in the eyes.

1718
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:42,374
- I was getting
a bit worried there, Poirot,

1719
01:44:42,667 --> 01:44:43,958
in case you'd done it after all,

1720
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:45,916
in your sleep perhaps.

1721
01:44:46,209 --> 01:44:49,749
- Very droll, Chief Inspector.

1722
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:51,749
- One thing
I don't understand, though.

1723
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:54,249
What put you on to Norman Gale
in the first place?

1724
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:56,333
- In the first place?
Et bien.

1725
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:59,166
In the first place, I looked
for the home of the wasp.

1726
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,249
And in the belongings
of Monsieur Gale,

1727
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:03,291
there was a matchbox,

1728
01:45:03,584 --> 01:45:06,374
an empty matchbox.

1729
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:08,499
Parfait.

1730
01:45:08,792 --> 01:45:10,958
- So where are you taking me,
Poirot?

1731
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:13,208
A little farewell lunch I hope.

1732
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,791
Nice little restaurant
you've just discovered?

1733
01:45:16,084 --> 01:45:18,249
I'm getting quite keen
on this French food, you know.

1734
01:45:18,542 --> 01:45:20,958
- Not exactly, Chief Inspector.

1735
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,999
Food for the soul, mon ami.
