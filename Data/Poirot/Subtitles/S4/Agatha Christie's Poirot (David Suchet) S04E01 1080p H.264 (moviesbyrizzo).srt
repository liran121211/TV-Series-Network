1
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:26,874
- Poirot!

2
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,208
- Ah!

3
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:30,249
Hastings!

4
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,124
Oh, mon ami.

5
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,416
- Get a couple of nice handbags
out of this.

6
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,874
- I'll take care of that,
thank you.

7
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,541
- Who is your friend, Hastings?

8
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,666
- Oh, this is Cedric.

9
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,833
He's a caiman.

10
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,208
I shot him on the Orinoco,

11
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,124
a few miles upstream
from La Urbana.

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,791
We'd been in portage around
white water all day,

13
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,999
and I was pretty exhausted.

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,249
I can tell you,
it's some distance--

15
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,374
- Hastings.

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,583
- What's that, old chap?

17
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:55,624
- You must tell me the story

18
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,333
in full detail later.

19
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,833
I think these gentlemen
wish to get home to bed.

20
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:00,999
- Oh, right.

21
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,249
So how have you been
these last six months?

22
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,583
Busy?

23
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,083
- No, the little gray cells,

24
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,708
I fear they grow the rust.

25
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,791
When the date approached
for your return,

26
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,166
I said to myself
"Now something will arise."

27
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,541
We will hunt again together,
we two.

28
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,749
- Sorry.

29
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,541
- But it must be
no common affair, Hastings.

30
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,499
It must be something recherche,
delicate, fine.

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,874
- Anyone would think you were
ordering dinner at the Ritz.

32
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,291
Sorry.

33
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,624
Where are we going?

34
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,541
I thought we were going
to my hotel first.

35
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,166
- There is no hotel, Hastings,

36
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,749
until you can reclaim
your apartment,

37
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,666
you stay with Poirot.

38
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,708
- Oh, I say.

39
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,916
This superfine crime of yours
hasn't turned up yet, I suppose.

40
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,666
- Pas encore.

41
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:14,499
At least, I am not sure.

42
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,666
- This is awfully decent of you,
Poirot.

43
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,499
- Well, not at all, mon ami.

44
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,791
I need you where
I can keep an eye on you,

45
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,999
to protect you from the beauties
with the auburn hair, no?

46
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,041
- What did you mean just now
when you said you weren't sure,

47
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,083
about the superfine crime?

48
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,291
- Ah.

49
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,541
Hastings...

50
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,958
Ah, Hastings,
you've forgotten your crocodile.

51
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,083
I would rather its curious smell
was confined to your bedroom.

52
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,833
- Oh.

53
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,833
Well, it was a present for you,
actually, Poirot.

54
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,958
- For me, Hastings?

55
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,541
Oh, that is beautiful.

56
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,374
- I mean,
if you don't like it...

57
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,333
- No, Hastings, it adds
a certain je ne sais quoi,

58
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,708
do you not think?

59
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:08,791
- Well, I thought so.

60
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,208
The chap who stuffed it for me

61
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:12,624
said the smell would go away
after about a month or so.

62
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,249
- Well, I like the smell,
Hastings.

63
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,208
One feels braced.

64
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:27,124
It brings to London the jungle.

65
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,249
- Good.

66
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,416
For one awful moment,

67
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,083
I thought you might not like
old Cedric.

68
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,291
- No.

69
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,666
- He's a caiman.

70
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,749
I shot him when we were still up
in Venezuela--

71
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,624
- Hastings, it is a week
since I received this letter.

72
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,874
What do you make of it?

73
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,208
- "Mr. Hercule Poirot,

74
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,874
"You fancy yourself, don't you,

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,999
"at solving mysteries
that are too difficult

76
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,374
"for our poor, thickheaded
British police?

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,416
"Let us see,
Mr. Clever Poirot,

78
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,624
"just how clever you can be.

79
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,124
"Perhaps you'll find this nut
too hard to crack.

80
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,291
"Look out for Andover
on the 21st of the month.

81
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,916
Yours sincerely,
A.B.C."

82
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,249
A.B.C.?

83
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,833
Typed, thick paper,

84
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,999
postmark London WC1.

85
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,374
- What is your opinion,
Hastings?

86
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,749
- Some madman, I suppose.

87
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:32,166
- A madman is a very
dangerous thing, my friend.

88
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,374
- Wait a minute.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,458
Today's the 21st.

90
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:35,624
What have you done about it?

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,874
Did you go to Andover?

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,124
- Hastings, as always,
the man of action, eh?

93
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,333
What is there to do?

94
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,374
There are no fingerprints.

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,124
No clues to the possible writer.

96
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
- Well, don't blame me

97
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,958
if there's a story
in the papers tomorrow

98
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,708
about a whacking great robbery
near Andover.

99
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,458
- What a comfort that would be.

100
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,166
- A comfort?

101
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,708
- It would dispossess my mind
of the fear of something else.

102
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,541
- Of what?

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,124
- Of murder, my friend.

104
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,374
- Cream, crackers--yes.

105
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,791
Edwards' Desiccated Soup.

106
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,874
Yes.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
Sausages?

108
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,791
I can't go carrying sausages
around all afternoon.

109
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,083
No.

110
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,041
My desk isn't a blooming larder,
Emily.

111
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,083
Supposing someone--

112
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,374
I'll do that, sir.

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,791
- Chief Inspector.

114
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,583
- Ah.
Morning, Poirot.

115
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,874
Well, well, well.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,458
If it isn't Captain Hastings,

117
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:52,458
back from his holidays in
the wilds of whatchamacallit.

118
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:56,333
Sit down, sit down.

119
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,333
Looking well too.

120
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,083
Getting a bit thin
on top, though, eh?

121
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,791
- Well, I don't know.
I--

122
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:06,249
- You'll be rivaling
Monsieur Poirot soon.

123
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,499
- Chief Inspector,

124
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,916
do you know
that Captain Hastings

125
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,666
has brought me back as a present
a crocodile?

126
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:12,999
- A caiman, actually.

127
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,041
I bagged him while
we were still up in Venezuela.

128
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,291
We'd been in portage around
white water all day, and--

129
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:20,916
- And to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

130
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,749
- Well, today is the 22nd,
Chief Inspector.

131
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,291
- Yeah.

132
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,374
- You recall
the anonymous letter.

133
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,416
- Oh, yes.
Beware the 21st.

134
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,958
Andover, wasn't it,
you mentioned?

135
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,208
- Oui.

136
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,499
- Just to keep you happy.

137
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:42,041
Get me Inspector Glen
at Andover, will you?

138
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,708
We get these anonymous letters
every day of the week.

139
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,166
People with nothing better to do

140
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,666
and a bit weak in the top story,
right?

141
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,166
Hello, Dennis?

142
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,249
Japp.

143
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,416
How are you?

144
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,083
Now, listen.

145
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,083
Do you remember that anonymous
letter I told you about?

146
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,541
Yeah.

147
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,749
Oh?
Really?

148
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,166
Right.

149
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,291
Yes, I better.

150
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,458
Right-o.

151
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,999
- Well?

152
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,291
- Well, I don't suppose
it means anything,

153
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,083
but an old woman who kept
a tobacco and newspaper shop

154
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,624
in Andover was battered to death
last night.

155
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,499
Glen says they think
they can lay their hands

156
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,166
on the man who did it, though.

157
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,374
All the same, I'll pop down
there and have a dekko.

158
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,124
- What was the name
of the woman, Chief Inspector?

159
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,708
- Ascher.
Mrs. Alice Ascher.

160
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,916
- No, I mean, the thing is,

161
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,791
there was no money
taken out of the till.

162
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,541
So, I mean,
one would expect

163
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,333
that they would have been after
the money.

164
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,874
- Oh, Poirot.
- Chief Inspector.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,249
- This is Inspector Glen.

166
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,291
He's in charge of the case.

167
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,791
- How do you do?

168
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,374
- Looks pretty
straightforward.

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,083
- The victim's Alice Ascher,
60 years old,

170
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,833
struck down behind her counter
by a heavy blow to the head.

171
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,208
- And do you suspect
the husband?

172
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,458
- We do.

173
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,374
We haven't been able
to find anyone yet

174
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,124
who saw Ascher
in the neighborhood,

175
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,666
but, of course,
it's early days.

176
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,124
- Did Mr. Ascher
live with his wife, Inspector?

177
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,083
- No, they separated
some years ago.

178
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,208
Ascher's a German.

179
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:22,583
Used to be a waiter,
but he took to drink.

180
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,958
- Well, perhaps you should look
at this, Inspector.

181
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,333
- Famous anonymous letter, eh?

182
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,249
- The body was found
in this corner, yes?

183
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,833
- Yes, laying sort of huddled.

184
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,624
- This doesn't read like Ascher.

185
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,999
I doubt if he's got
the wits for it.

186
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,291
It's odd that the letter
should mention

187
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,541
the 21st of the month,
though.

188
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,916
Course, might be
a coincidence.

189
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:59,124
- I do not like that kind
of coincidence, Inspector.

190
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,874
- Nothing was missing
from the shop.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,291
- No, money in the till
seems undisturbed.

192
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,583
No signs of robbery.

193
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,874
- Something has been added,
perhaps.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,083
- Added?

195
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,416
- An ABC railway guide?

196
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,708
She must have been looking up
trains from Andover.

197
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,291
Or a customer.

198
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,083
- Fingerprints?

199
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:34,499
- Only Mrs. Ascher's,
as far as we can tell, so far.

200
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,708
- My God, Hastings.

201
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,749
- Wedding picture.

202
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,249
- A beautiful woman, n'est pas?

203
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,583
- Yes.

204
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,999
Look at this room, Poirot.

205
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,041
All that's left of a life:

206
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,916
couple of broken
china ornaments,

207
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,374
photograph,

208
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,583
new pair of stockings.

209
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:56,666
- Hastings.

210
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,041
Let us not become sentimental.

211
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,416
There is nothing more
for us here.

212
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,749
Come.

213
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,333
- Dear, oh, dear.

214
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,041
- Something is amiss,
Chief Inspector?

215
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,666
- I've been trying
to get a list of people

216
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,541
who were seen coming in here.

217
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,958
- And no one's seen anybody?

218
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,541
- Oh, they've seen people,
all right.

219
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,833
Three tall men
with furtive walks,

220
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,541
four short men
with black mustaches,

221
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,333
two men with beards,

222
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,374
three fat men,

223
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,958
one man with a peculiar hat,

224
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,833
and if I am to believe
what they say,

225
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,958
every one of them
had a sinister expression.

226
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,666
- Does anyone claim
to have seen this man, Ascher?

227
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,374
- Oh, no, nothing helpful
like that.

228
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,291
- She never knew what hit her.

229
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,833
Struck in the back of the head.

230
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,249
- You can't believe

231
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,791
it's the same woman as in
the photograph, can you?

232
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,958
- Well, yes, Hastings,
you can see the line of the jaw,

233
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:58,291
the bones,
the structure of the head.

234
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,583
Did she have any children?

235
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,916
- No.

236
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:02,958
But there's a niece.

237
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,958
Name of Mary Drower.

238
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,874
She's in service
out near Overton.

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,166
Steady young woman, they say.

240
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,083
- The weapon hasn't been found,
of course.

241
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,333
A weighted stick, club,
something like that.

242
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,666
- Would there be needed much
force to strike such a blow?

243
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,124
- Meaning, I suppose,

244
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,333
would a shaky old man of 70
like Ascher do it?

245
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,249
Perfectly possible,

246
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,624
given sufficient weight
in the head of the weapon.

247
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,124
- I haven't done nothing!

248
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,249
It is a shame and a scandal
to bring me here!

249
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,791
Let me go!

250
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,083
Schweinhund!

251
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:36,541
How dare you!

252
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,583
- Stop.

253
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,083
- I haven't done nothing.

254
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,416
- I'm not charging you
with anything yet, Ascher,

255
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,041
and you're not obliged
to say anything.

256
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,416
- I did not kill her.

257
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,499
It is all lies!

258
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,874
- You threatened to
often enough.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,791
- No, that was a joke.

260
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,874
- Take him away.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,208
Detained on suspicion.

262
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,666
- I never did go near Alice.

263
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,583
I haven't done anything!

264
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,833
Let me go!

265
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,291
- You perceive, Hastings?

266
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,333
There is already
one further point in the favor

267
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,208
of the innocence
of Monsieur Ascher.

268
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,624
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

269
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,708
If he had been abusing
and threatening his wife,

270
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,041
she would have been facing him
over the counter.

271
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,166
But instead, she had her back
to her assailant.

272
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,583
Obviously, she is reaching
for some tobacco

273
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,791
or cigarettes for a customer.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,249
Ah.

275
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,208
I think it is you who are
Mademoiselle Mary Drower.

276
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,208
Will you not sit down,
mademoiselle?

277
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,666
- No, thank you, sir.

278
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,333
I daresay
the mistress wouldn't mind,

279
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,708
but I'd rather not
while she's out.

280
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:49,166
- You were fond of your aunt.

281
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,624
- Oh, it's terrible.

282
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,249
Poor Auntie.
Such a hard life she'd had too.

283
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,791
She was always so good to me,
Auntie was.

284
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,958
And all the trouble she had
with that German devil.

285
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,749
It was awful,
the things he used to say,

286
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
that he'd cut her throat
and such like.

287
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,249
Swearing and cursing too.

288
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:18,083
It's dreadful to think, sir,
what people come to.

289
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:24,291
- Mademoiselle, if you should
need me at any time,

290
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,333
you will be sure
to contact me, yes?

291
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,249
- Is there something
queer going on, sir?

292
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,499
- Yes, my child.

293
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,833
Something queer is going on.

294
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,624
But later, you may be able
to help me perhaps.

295
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,416
- Well, I'll do anything,
sir.

296
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,499
It wasn't right,
Auntie being killed.

297
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,749
- Well?

298
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,124
- I think that Monsieur Ascher

299
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,041
is a suspect most unlikely,
Hastings.

300
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,083
- Ah.

301
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:51,416
What about the girl then?

302
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,708
- It is always possible,
of course, but with what motive?

303
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,833
- I see what you mean.

304
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,124
If only he'd left a clue.

305
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,583
- Ah, the clue.

306
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,624
It is always the clue that
attracts you, yes, Hastings?

307
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,291
Alas, our murderer, he did not
smoke a cigarette exotique,

308
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,791
leave the ash on the floor,

309
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,166
and then step on the ash

310
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:13,083
with shoes that have nails
of a pattern most curious.

311
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,583
He's most unobliging,
our murderer.

312
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,208
But at least, mon ami,
you have the railway guide:

313
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,416
The A.B.C.

314
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,041
Now there is a clue for you.

315
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,791
- You mean, you don't think
he left it there by mistake?

316
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,833
- No, he left it on purpose.

317
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,041
The fingerprints tell us that.

318
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,666
- But, Poirot, there
weren't any fingerprints on it.

319
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,541
- Exactemente, Hastings.

320
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:48,208
Our murderer, he is in the dark
and seeks to remain in the dark.

321
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,083
But in the very nature
of things,

322
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,624
he cannot help
to throw the light upon himself.

323
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,416
- What do you think, Poirot?

324
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,624
- Excellent, Hastings.

325
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,833
Most artistic.
Well done.

326
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,416
- You don't think
he's a bit overpowering?

327
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,749
We can find somewhere else
for the fruit bowl.

328
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,958
What we could do--

329
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,208
- There's another letter,
Hastings.

330
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,333
- Sorry?

331
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,791
- Another letter from A.B.C.

332
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,291
- "Dear Mr. Poirot,

333
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,958
"Well, the Andover business
went with a swing, didn't it?

334
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,874
"First game to me, I think,

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,208
"but the fun's
only just beginning.

336
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,666
"Let me draw your attention
Bexhill-on-Sea.

337
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,958
"Date: the 25th inst.

338
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,958
"What a merry time
we are having.

339
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,208
Yours sincerely,
A.B.C."

340
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,833
Good God.

341
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,499
- I fear that the death
of Madame Ascher

342
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,708
is only the beginning,
Hastings.

343
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,916
- There's no doubt
that the two letters

344
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,333
were typed on the same machine,
I suppose.

345
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,458
- No,
and we can fairly assume

346
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,874
that the writer was responsible
for your murder in Andover.

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,541
Now we have definite warning
of a second crime

348
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,124
scheduled to take place

349
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,291
in Superintendent Carter's
county on the 25th,

350
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,874
the day after tomorrow

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,499
at Bexhill.

352
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,874
What steps do you think
the Sussex police can take,

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,291
Superintendent Carter?

354
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,999
- Well, it's difficult.

355
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,791
There's not the least clue
who the victim may be.

356
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,999
- It is possible that the
surname of the intended victim

357
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,041
will begin with
the letter B.

358
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,833
- That would be something.

359
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,458
- I suggest it as a possibility,
no more.

360
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,958
It came to my mind when
I read the signature "A.B.C."

361
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,249
on the first letter and again
when I heard the name

362
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,624
of the unfortunate woman
in Andover.

363
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,166
- You mean, first a Mrs. Ascher
in Andover,

364
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,124
then someone beginning
with B in Bexhill?

365
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,249
- Oui.

366
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,749
- Well, that's possible,
I suppose.

367
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,999
I mean, we are dealing
with a madman.

368
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,958
- But so far he hasn't given us
any clue as to his motive.

369
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,083
- Does a madman have any motive?

370
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,124
- Perhaps he's gonna murder
someone in every town

371
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,708
of the alphabet all the way
from Andover to, uh...

372
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,749
- Zennor.

373
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,083
I've thought a lot about it,
you see.

374
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,833
- Well, at least
we can take some precautions.

375
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,291
Superintendent Carter,

376
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:31,916
perhaps it would be possible
for your men

377
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:35,208
to make a special note
of all the Bs in your area,

378
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:37,083
especially small shopkeepers,

379
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,124
and, naturally, keep tabs on all
strangers as far as possible.

380
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,249
- Bexhill's a seaside resort,
man.

381
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,749
It's the middle
of the holiday season.

382
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,499
People are flooding in.

383
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,333
- So tomorrow's the big day.

384
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,124
Is it old women in tobacconist's
shops, do you think?

385
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,791
- It does not seem likely,
Hastings.

386
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,791
Shops, though, perhaps.

387
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,499
Which of us at some time or
another has not felt aggrieved

388
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,041
by a shopkeeper?

389
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,333
- Good Lord, yes.

390
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,166
Well, at least we know
it can't be Ascher now.

391
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,833
I mean, he's still in custody.

392
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,583
- But what about the girl,
Hastings?

393
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,458
- Mary...whatsit,
the maid?

394
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,666
No.

395
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,708
- Seats at all prices, ma'am.

396
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,124
Seats at all prices.

397
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
- I wouldn't give much
for a murderer's chances

398
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,041
with all these men
of yours around, Japp.

399
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,291
- He's as good as nabbed.

400
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,208
- The sanity of a town
full of men

401
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:06,874
against the insanity
of one man?

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,708
Remember the long-continued
successes of Jack the Ripper.

403
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,083
- Hmm.

404
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,541
We don't need
another one of those,

405
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,499
thank you very much.

406
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,791
- I am afraid, my friends.

407
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,999
I am very much afraid.

408
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,999
- Come on.
Come on, boy.

409
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,083
- Hastings!

410
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:33,041
It has happened.

411
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,791
- But today is the 25th.

412
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:40,249
- The murder took place last
night between 12:00 and 1:00.

413
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,166
Our homicidal joker's
a man of his word.

414
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,541
If he says the 25th,
then the 25th it is,

415
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,458
even if it's only by
a few minutes.

416
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,874
- But we're quite sure
this is the crime?

417
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,583
- An A.B.C. open
at the trains to Bexhill

418
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:55,374
was found actually
under the body.

419
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,874
- Do we know who is
the dead girl, Chief Inspector?

420
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,416
- She's been identified
as a Miss Elizabeth Barnard:

421
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,916
23 years of age,

422
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,874
worked as a waitress
at the De La Warr Pavilion.

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,958
- Was she pretty?

424
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,833
There he goes again.

425
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,166
- That does not seem to you
to be important, eh?

426
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,749
Mais pour une femme,
it is of the first importance.

427
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,833
It often decides her destiny.

428
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,999
With what was the girl
strangled, Chief Inspector?

429
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,499
- Her own belt.

430
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,958
- Ah, at last, we have
a piece of evidence

431
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,374
that is very definite,

432
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,499
and it tells one something,
does it not?

433
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,624
- I don't see what.

434
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,708
- I have broken the news
to her parents,

435
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,458
but I thought
I'd let them recover a bit

436
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:44,874
before questioning them.

437
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,166
- Right.

438
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,333
- There are other members
of the family, yes?

439
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,708
- There's a sister.
Typist in London.

440
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,624
She's been communicated with.

441
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,791
And there's a young man.

442
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,749
Girl was supposed to be
out with him last night,

443
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,833
I gather.

444
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,874
- Any luck from
the A.B.C. guide?

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,083
- No.
No fingerprints.

446
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,999
Open at the page of Bexhill.

447
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,333
- Yes, that's our man,
all right.

448
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,708
- Well, it must mean something.

449
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,166
Something to do with the trains

450
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,499
from Andover and Bexhill,
perhaps.

451
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,708
- Yes, that is a point.

452
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,166
- This is most distressing,
Chief Inspector,

453
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,374
most distressing.

454
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,916
How will it will
affect our business,

455
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:29,958
I shudder to think.

456
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,541
- You'll have a boom, madam.

457
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,499
You won't be able to dish out
the dainty teas quick enough.

458
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,166
- Really?

459
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:37,624
Oh.

460
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,166
How awful.

461
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:42,499
People are so awful.

462
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:43,833
- Mademoiselle Merrion,

463
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,624
how long
had Mademoiselle Barnard

464
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,916
been working here?

465
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,958
- This was the second summer.

466
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:51,874
- She was pretty, yes?

467
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,374
- She was a nice,
clean-looking girl.

468
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,166
- What time did she go off-duty
last night?

469
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,374
- 8:00.
We close at 8:00.

470
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,333
- Did she say what
she was going to do after work?

471
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,916
- We were hardly on
those sort of terms.

472
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,541
- Nobody came
and called for her?

473
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,583
Nothing like that?

474
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,541
- Oh, no.

475
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,208
She had a young man, I believe,

476
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:19,083
Donald Fraser.

477
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,999
- Weren't you alarmed

478
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,791
when your daughter
didn't come home last night?

479
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,916
- We didn't know she hadn't.

480
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:49,749
Mrs. Barnard and I
go to bed early.

481
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,291
We never knew Betty
hadn't come home

482
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:56,166
till the police officer
came this morning.

483
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:59,124
- Was she in the habit
of coming home late?

484
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,166
- You know what goes on
nowadays, Inspector.

485
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:08,249
All the same, though,
she was usually in by 11:00.

486
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:11,458
And she had
this steady young fellow

487
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,374
she was sort of engaged to.

488
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,583
Donald Fraser, his name is.

489
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,999
It doesn't make
any bloody sense.

490
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:24,166
- No, it doesn't.

491
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:32,666
- Excuse me, Monsieur Barnard.

492
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:36,083
Did Betty ever mention
any connection with Andover?

493
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:39,624
Did she have there, perhaps,
any friends?

494
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,083
- Andover?

495
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,541
No.

496
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:55,916
- I'd like to look over
Miss Barnard's room, if I may.

497
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:57,208
There might be something, sir.

498
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:59,416
Letters, diary...

499
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,624
- All right.
It's in here.

500
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,083
- Who are you?

501
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:13,166
- You're Miss Barnard.

502
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,749
- Yes, I'm Megan Barnard.

503
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,458
I suppose you belong
to the police.

504
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,041
- Well, not exactly.

505
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,249
- Well, what are you?

506
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,583
- Well--
- Where's Mum and Dad?

507
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:21,874
- Your father's in there

508
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,291
showing the police
your sister's bedroom,

509
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,458
and your mother's in there.

510
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:26,666
I wonder if--

511
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,041
- Are you following me?

512
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,749
What do you want?

513
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,708
- This is
Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

514
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,541
- Mademoiselle Barnard.

515
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,041
- I don't see what
Monsieur Hercule Poirot's doing

516
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,166
in our humble little crime.

517
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,124
- What you do not see,
mademoiselle,

518
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,291
and what I do not see,

519
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,499
it would fill a volume,

520
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,833
but what is important

521
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:01,333
is something that
will not be easy to find.

522
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:02,541
- What's that?

523
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,083
- The truth.

524
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:10,749
- I don't know about the truth.

525
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,374
I only know what I feel.

526
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,833
- But that is the most important
thing we have, mademoiselle,

527
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,999
in the hunt for the murderer
of your sister.

528
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,916
- All right.

529
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,458
It wasn't in Betty's nature
to be fond of one person

530
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,458
and not be interested
in anyone else.

531
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,708
And working
in the De La Warr Pavilion,

532
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,708
she was always running up
against nice-looking men.

533
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,208
- I understand, mademoiselle.

534
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:35,208
- Do you?
Her boyfriend didn't.

535
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,874
She was really keen on him.

536
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,249
He couldn't see why she wanted
to go out with other people.

537
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,249
Once or twice, they had flaming
big rows about it.

538
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,833
Don was so violent.
Betty was frightened.

539
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,624
- When was this?

540
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,458
- Last time
was about a month ago.

541
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:56,166
They had an awful scene.

542
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:59,041
Don was all white and shaking.

543
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,249
Oh, there he is.

544
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,499
- Quick, mademoiselle,
run and intercept him.

545
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,999
I wish to speak with him

546
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,374
before the estimable
Chief Inspector Japp.

547
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:11,583
- Don?

548
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,583
- Did Mademoiselle Barnard
tell you

549
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,166
where she was going
last night?

550
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:19,083
- She told me she was going to
St. Leonard's with a girlfriend.

551
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,791
- And did you believe her?

552
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,958
- Who are you anyway?

553
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,583
You don't belong
to the police.

554
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,416
- No, monsieur.

555
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:30,624
I am better than the police.

556
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,791
- Tell him.

557
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,166
- I believed her
when she said it.

558
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:42,041
But afterwards...

559
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:45,249
- What did you do?

560
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,416
- I don't know.

561
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:47,624
I lost my head.

562
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,541
I was convinced
she was with some man.

563
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:53,499
I thought he might have taken
her to Eastbourne in a car.

564
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,749
I went on there,

565
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,458
looked in the hotels
and restaurants.

566
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:03,541
They must have thought
I was mad.

567
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:07,624
I hung around cinemas,
went on the pier.

568
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,916
In the end,
I gave up and came back.

569
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,916
Not much of an alibi, is it?

570
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,874
- No, my friend.

571
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,291
Not much.

572
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,416
- Well, Donald Fraser
certainly seemed to have

573
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,208
a perfectly good motive
for the murder,

574
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:31,624
and opportunity.

575
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,333
- For killing Mademoiselle
Betty Barnard, yes.

576
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,083
But what was the motive
for killing Madame Ascher?

577
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,749
- Well, that we'll have to
find out.

578
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:43,499
They're both women, of course.

579
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,749
- And what was the motive

580
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,166
for writing those letters to me,
Hastings?

581
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,416
There's something
about those letters,

582
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,624
something that bothers me.

583
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,166
- You've been very careful.

584
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,041
But you made one mistake.

585
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,583
It'll be the first time

586
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,666
that anyone has suggested you
as the murderer.

587
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:06,708
You'll be watched.

588
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:07,874
You'll be questioned.

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,916
You'll be followed.

590
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:09,999
You'll give yourself away.

591
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,166
And they'll get you.

592
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,791
- I killed her, did I?

593
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,416
Accusing me, are you?

594
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,416
Why don't you run away, Mary?

595
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,124
You would if you can,

596
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,166
but you don't move, Mary.

597
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,999
Why?

598
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,749
- Because...

599
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,166
- Because you know
I'm not the killer.

600
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,458
- Yes!

601
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,374
- That's where you're wrong.

602
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,749
I am the Dorset murderer.

603
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:44,166
I killed Lily James

604
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:47,374
and all the others,

605
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,083
and now I am going to kill you!

606
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,333
- We've kept the general public
in the dark so far

607
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,999
about the A.B.C. link
between these murders.

608
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,541
If we continue to keep them
in the dark,

609
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,041
then we don't get any
cooperation.

610
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,833
- But if you make it public,
Chief Inspector,

611
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,249
you're playing the game
of the murderer,

612
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,958
which is perhaps why
he writes those letters:

613
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:11,958
for notoriety, publicity.

614
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:14,833
- Well, I think
we should chance it.

615
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,749
Splash it about
in the headlines.

616
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,333
- I did not say this before,
Hastings,

617
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:33,374
because, well, perhaps
it would have been mistaken

618
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,999
for self-importance,

619
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,916
a characteristic that I dislike
more than any other.

620
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,041
- Oh, right.

621
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,708
Delicious soup, this.

622
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,874
- But it is possible

623
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,916
that our murderer
is committing his crimes

624
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:56,541
because of a direct personal
hatred against me,

625
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,124
Hercule Poirot.

626
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,208
- Because he writes
the letters to you, you mean.

627
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:01,916
- Exactemente, Hastings.

628
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:05,583
Or perhaps the animosity
of our murderer,

629
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,499
it is impersonal

630
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,583
and merely because
I'm a foreigner.

631
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,624
- Yes.

632
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,124
Well, there are people
like that.

633
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,541
- It is only the late post,
Hastings.

634
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,166
- Yes, I know.

635
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,166
I was expecting
Lillywhite's catalog.

636
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,166
I've been thinking of buying
some new golf clubs.

637
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:30,208
I've still only got those old
ones that belonged to my father.

638
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,666
Lord.

639
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:32,958
- What is it, Hastings?

640
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:36,249
- It's another one.
Another A.B.C. letter.

641
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,249
Postmarked London WC1 again.

642
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,416
That's significant, you know,
I'm sure it is.

643
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,499
- You open it, Hastings.

644
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,333
Quickly.

645
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,166
- "Dear Mr. Poirot,

646
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,208
"Not too good
at these little criminal matters

647
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:52,833
"as you thought yourself,
are you?

648
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,749
"Rather past your prime,
perhaps.

649
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,874
"Let us see
if you can do better this time.

650
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,249
"This time it's an easy one.

651
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,791
"Churston on the 29th.

652
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,708
"Do try and do something
about it.

653
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,874
"It's a bit dull having
it all my own way, you know.

654
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,416
"Good hunting.

655
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,666
Yours ever,
A.B.C."

656
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:11,124
I wonder where Churston is.

657
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,499
- Hastings,

658
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,458
you do not realize?

659
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,208
Today is the 29th.

660
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,416
- What?

661
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:18,791
- When was that letter written?

662
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,999
- 26th.

663
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:24,083
- Mon Dieu.

664
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,958
Look, Hastings.

665
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:29,041
You did not notice
the wrong address.

666
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,583
- "Monsieur Hercule Poirot,

667
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:31,624
"White Horse Mansions.

668
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,291
"Not known
at White Horse Mansions.

669
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,916
"Not known
at White Horse Court.

670
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,541
Try Whitehaven Mansions."

671
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:39,583
- Does even chance
aid this madman?

672
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,833
C'est trop tard.

673
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:42,874
- You can't be sure of that.

674
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,499
- It's 10:20, Hastings.

675
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,666
- Churston, Devon.

676
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:50,624
Get in at 7:15,
leaves Paddington at midnight.

677
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,499
- Any word from Churston yet?

678
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,749
- Not yet.

679
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,083
We've got men moving in
from all over the area.

680
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:22,291
It's only a village.

681
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:23,708
Have you got the letter
with you?

682
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,499
- Yes.

683
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,833
- White Horse Mansions.

684
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,249
Of all the blessed luck.

685
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,124
- With two letters,
he gets the address right.

686
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,666
Why now does he get it wrong?

687
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,999
- Perhaps he did it on purpose.

688
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,958
- No, this fellow's
got these barmy rules,

689
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:36,749
and I think he sticks to them.

690
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,999
- I know.

691
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,083
He drinks White Horse whiskey.

692
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:42,333
- C'est ingenieux ca!

693
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:43,541
He types the address,

694
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,583
and the bottle,
it is in front of him.

695
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,999
- We've heard of psychology
at Scotland Yard too, you know?

696
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,499
- Sir Carmichael always
takes his after-dinner walk

697
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,583
along the cliff top,
Miss Grey.

698
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:11,958
When he gets to the headland,

699
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:15,041
he turns right
and comes up past the farm.

700
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,583
But he's always back by 10:00.

701
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,749
Always.

702
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,624
- It's after midnight now.

703
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,749
Suppose he's had an accident
or something.

704
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,541
I'm going down to the cliff.

705
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,208
- I'll go to the other side
of the field.

706
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,041
Perhaps he's started back.

707
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,958
Miss Grey!
Over here!

708
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,083
- They've taken the body
up to the house.

709
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:20,624
Blow to the back of the head,
apparently.

710
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,708
Blunt instrument.

711
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,041
This should make people sit up

712
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,874
now that the newspapers
are in the know.

713
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,583
Three murders within ten days.

714
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,874
The whole country will
be looking for A.B.C. now.

715
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,458
- But what will they be
looking for, Hastings?

716
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,833
- Well, a madman.

717
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:38,458
- And what does
a madman look like?

718
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,041
- Well...

719
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:43,749
- Madame Ascher had no
connection with Bexhill-on-Sea,

720
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,249
and Mademoiselle Betty Barnard

721
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,208
had no link with Andover
that we can discover.

722
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,249
And we will find that neither
apparently had anything to do

723
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,416
with Churston and
Sir Carmichael Clarke.

724
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:58,666
On that, I would place a wager.

725
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,208
Hundreds of miles

726
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:04,249
and everything about their lives
seems to separate them.

727
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,791
What is it that binds
them together?

728
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,666
- But why?

729
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,041
I mean, what earthly benefit
can accrue from such a crime,

730
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,999
even in the most diseased
imagination?

731
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,749
- You go straight
to the point, monsieur.

732
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,749
- Ah, Poirot,
this is Mr. Franklin Clarke,

733
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,999
Sir Carmichael's brother.

734
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,416
- You have my condolences,
Monsieur Clarke.

735
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,999
- Mr. Poirot, Captain Hastings.

736
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,416
- How do you do?

737
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,999
- Now let me have a few facts,
would you, Mr. Clarke?

738
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,541
- Certainly.

739
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,833
- Your brother, I take it,

740
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,624
was in his usual health
and spirit yesterday?

741
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,916
- Oh, yes,
I should say.

742
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,999
He was quite his usual self.

743
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,416
- Not upset or worried at all?

744
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,874
- Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

745
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,499
I didn't say that.

746
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:53,999
To be upset and worried was my
poor brother's normal condition.

747
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,708
- Oh?

748
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,416
- Well, I was shocked
at the change in him

749
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,583
when I returned
from the east recently.

750
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:03,916
His wife's illness preyed
on his mind terribly.

751
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,333
- Illness?

752
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:06,916
- Oh, my sister-in-law,
Lady Clarke,

753
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:09,333
is in very bad health.

754
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:10,624
Between ourselves,

755
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,499
she's suffering from
an incurable cancer.

756
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,708
She can't live much longer.

757
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,333
- Sir Carmichael
hadn't received

758
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,749
any unexpected
or unpleasant letters?

759
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,041
- Not that I was aware of.

760
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,874
- He wasn't short
of a bauble or two, was he?

761
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,916
- My brother was
a very wealthy man.

762
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,708
- And in possession
of a collection

763
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,874
that is extremely beautiful.

764
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,166
- Yes.

765
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:44,291
It's what he lived for,
really.

766
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,333
- Have any strangers come
to the house

767
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:48,708
asking for Sir Carmichael
recently?

768
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,124
- The doctor says
he's finished, sir.

769
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,333
- Thank you, Deveril.

770
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,499
Uh, Deveril,
have any strangers

771
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,916
been inquiring for
Sir Carmichael recently?

772
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,874
- No, sir.

773
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,291
- Ah, doctor,
anything to tell us?

774
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,041
- Well, nothing
we didn't know already.

775
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,416
Death instantaneous.

776
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:18,916
We've put him
in the billiard room.

777
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:23,958
- I'll just go and have a word
with Lady Clarke.

778
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:28,208
- Ah, this is Miss Thora Grey,
gentlemen,

779
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:29,874
my brother's secretary.

780
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,374
- How do you do?

781
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,208
- I'll talk to you later,
Miss Grey, if I may.

782
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,249
- Yes.

783
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,499
- Mademoiselle.

784
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,666
- I'll be in the library,
if you want me.

785
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,666
- Hastings.

786
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,083
- It just doesn't stand
to reason.

787
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:59,583
There must be a connection
between these victims.

788
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,624
We just haven't found it yet.

789
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,583
- No.

790
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,916
We hit our heads against
a stone brick.

791
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,458
There is no connection.

792
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,749
- There must be.

793
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,833
- I say no, Hastings.

794
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,083
There is no connection whatever
between these people

795
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,333
except that their names begin

796
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:21,749
with certain letters
of the alphabet.

797
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,041
We have searched
the background

798
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,999
of the victims
and of the suspects

799
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,624
for any other connection.

800
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,916
Hastings can find nothing.

801
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,958
Scotland Yard can find nothing.

802
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:32,874
Even I can find nothing.

803
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,958
No, we are wasting our time

804
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:36,333
because there is nothing
to find.

805
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:37,416
- You mean those people

806
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,791
were complete strangers
to the murderer?

807
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,874
- Prcisement, Hastings.

808
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,124
Chosen only because of his mania
for the alphabet.

809
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,541
- Finished with that?

810
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,708
- Yes.

811
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,166
- Nasty business, eh?

812
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:16,499
- Yes, very.

813
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,166
- You never know with lunatics,
do you?

814
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,374
They don't always look barmy.

815
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,458
Sometimes they can look
just like you and me.

816
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,083
- Yes, I suppose they can.

817
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:33,499
- Now, sometimes it's the war
or something,

818
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,249
and they've never been right
since.

819
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,749
I don't hold with wars.

820
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,833
- I don't hold with plague
and sleeping sickness

821
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,708
and famine and cancer,
but they happen all the same.

822
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,916
- Ah, but war's preventable.

823
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,124
- Shh!

824
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,041
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

825
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,958
I expect you was in the war.

826
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:14,291
- Yes, yes.
Yes, I was.

827
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:18,666
And it did...

828
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:21,083
unsettle me.

829
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,833
- They're all here.
- Ah.

830
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,458
- What did you get?
- Biscuits.

831
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:47,624
- Ah.

832
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:56,249
- And so we all are assembled,
eh?

833
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,791
Let us begin with you,
Mademoiselle Drower.

834
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:03,624
When were you last in contact
with your aunt?

835
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,249
- I hadn't seen Auntie
for a fortnight, sir.

836
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:09,874
I'd had a letter from her,
though, two days previous.

837
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,874
- Ah, now these are
just the sort of facts

838
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,333
which could provide a clue
that is vital, eh?

839
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:16,499
Now, I believe that you all
may have some information

840
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,833
that you are not aware
that you have.

841
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:20,916
Did you keep that letter?

842
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,958
- No, sir, but I remember
what it said.

843
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:26,208
She said the old devil
had been 'round,

844
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:29,208
and she'd sent him off
with a flea in his ear.

845
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:32,624
And she said she expected me
over on the Wednesday--

846
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,791
that's my day out, sir--

847
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:37,583
and said we'd go
to the pictures.

848
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:41,791
It was going to be
my birthday, sir.

849
00:44:41,917 --> 00:44:44,749
I'm sorry, sir.

850
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:47,374
I don't mean to be silly.

851
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,583
It's just the thought of her
looking forward to our treat.

852
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,749
- It's always the little things
that get one.

853
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:03,083
Especially anything
like a treat or a present.

854
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:06,583
- Same thing happened
when Betty died.

855
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:09,374
Mum had bought her some
stockings as a present.

856
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,208
That very morning, in fact.

857
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,916
Poor mum.

858
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:16,458
Found her crying over them.

859
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:18,208
She kept saying,
"I bought them for Betty,

860
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:20,624
and she never even saw them."

861
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,166
- Look, uh...

862
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:25,958
All of us here
have an interest

863
00:45:26,084 --> 00:45:28,624
in bringing the murderer
to book.

864
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,999
Suppose we join forces to try
and track the fellow down?

865
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:37,374
- I'm sure Mr. Poirot and
the police are quite capable.

866
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,749
- Well, speaking for myself,

867
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,791
I am never too proud
to accept a little help.

868
00:45:45,084 --> 00:45:48,499
Mademoiselle Grey,
when you return to Devon,

869
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,791
and you think back to the day

870
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,333
that Sir Carmichael Clarke
was killed,

871
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:57,624
you may perhaps remember seeing
around the village a stranger.

872
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,583
- No.

873
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:01,874
I know I didn't.

874
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,833
Anyway, I've left Churston
for good.

875
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:07,666
- Now, Miss Grey kindly stayed
on to help me clear things up,

876
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:12,166
but, naturally,
she prefers a post in London.

877
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:15,166
- I see.

878
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:17,833
How is Lady Clarke?

879
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,749
- Oh, pretty bad.

880
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,958
By the way, Mr. Poirot,

881
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:23,958
I wonder if you could see
a way to running down

882
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,499
and paying her a visit?

883
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:29,416
Before I left, she expressed
a desire to see you.

884
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,874
- Mais certainement,
Monsieur Clarke.

885
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:40,708
- Do you think their cooperation
will lead to anything?

886
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,833
- It is possible.

887
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:46,791
You know, Hastings,

888
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:49,624
I cannot rid my mind

889
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,791
of the impression
that something was said

890
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,624
this afternoon
that was significant.

891
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,666
Ah, it is odd.

892
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:03,583
I cannot pin it down exactly.

893
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:06,041
But something passed
through my mind

894
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,958
that reminded me of that which
I had already seen

895
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:12,166
or heard or noted.

896
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,124
It will come to me.

897
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,874
Something is the matter,
Hastings?

898
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,791
- Eh?
No, no, no, no.

899
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:28,083
I was just thinking about D,
as a matter of fact.

900
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:29,749
- For the next murder?

901
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,374
- Yes.

902
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,999
I mean,
is he out there somewhere,

903
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,374
planning it?

904
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,999
Gives you the shivers
just to think about it.

905
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:19,291
- "A.B.C. murders.

906
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:21,749
Captain Hastings speaks."

907
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,833
- Poirot, I--

908
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:24,041
- '"After third murder,

909
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,583
'"the brutal slaying
of millionaire

910
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:26,999
'"Sir Carmichael Clarke,

911
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:30,791
"Monsieur Poirot takes
grave view of situation,'

912
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:33,541
says Captain Hastings."

913
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,124
- Well--

914
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,708
- "Andover, Bexhill,
Churston...

915
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,874
"Where will A.B.C. strike next?

916
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,874
'"Monsieur Poirot

917
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,291
says Captain Hastings."

918
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:48,541
- Okay, Poirot,
I didn't say all those things.

919
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,291
- I know, Hastings.

920
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,249
Often, between the spoken word
and the written,

921
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,874
there is an astonishing gulf,
n'est pas?

922
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,583
- I wouldn't like you
to think that I--

923
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,999
- Do not worry yourself,
mon ami.

924
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,166
In fact, these imbecilities,
they might even help.

925
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:03,583
- How?

926
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,583
- Because if our murderer reads

927
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,208
what I am supposed to have said
in the daily blood today,

928
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:12,166
he will lose all respect for me
as an opponent.

929
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:16,874
But after another crime,
we will know infinitely more.

930
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,083
Crime is revealing.

931
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,583
- Just a minute.

932
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,999
Lady Clarke.

933
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:46,749
Monsieur Poirot is here.

934
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:49,166
- Oh, yes.

935
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,499
Monsieur Poirot.

936
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,791
- Lady Clarke.

937
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:59,791
May I introduce my friend
and associate Captain Hastings?

938
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,166
- How do you do?

939
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,749
So good of you both to come.

940
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:08,666
- Merci.

941
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:11,791
- It was about Car,
wasn't it?

942
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:16,208
About Car's death?

943
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,583
You haven't caught him yet?

944
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,416
- Not yet.

945
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:28,124
- He must have been loitering
'round here that day.

946
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,624
- But no stranger came
to the house that day.

947
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,958
- Who says so?

948
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:37,833
- Well, the servants say so,
and Miss Grey said so.

949
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,958
- That girl is a liar.

950
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:41,333
- Oh, but--

951
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:45,291
- And, of course,
Car thought the world of her.

952
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,833
He couldn't see it was only
his money she was interested in.

953
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:55,916
Once I was out of the way...

954
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:58,124
- Lady Clarke,

955
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,791
why do you say that
Mademoiselle Grey is a liar?

956
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:02,499
- Because she is.

957
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:06,541
She told you no strangers
came to the house, didn't she?

958
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:07,999
- Yes.

959
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,749
- Very well then.

960
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,124
I saw her with my own eyes,

961
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:17,458
talking to
a perfectly strange man,

962
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:21,624
out of this window.

963
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,541
- May I?
- Please.

964
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,749
- Merci.

965
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,958
- At the garden gate.

966
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:35,708
- When was this,
Lady Clarke?

967
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:41,249
- In the morning
of the day Car died,

968
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:45,833
at about 11:00.

969
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:50,416
- What was he like, this man?

970
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:53,958
- Oh, an ordinary sort of man.

971
00:51:54,084 --> 00:51:55,541
- No.
Pardon.

972
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,958
A gentleman, a tradesman,
perhaps?

973
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:06,208
- A shabby sort of person.

974
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:10,374
I...

975
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,374
I can't remember.

976
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,874
- That was an extraordinary
story about Miss Grey

977
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,416
and the strange man.

978
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:22,041
- It is as I tell you,
Hastings.

979
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,374
Always there is something
to be discovered.

980
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,374
- But why did she lie
and say she'd seen no one?

981
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,749
It's monstrous to suppose
that a girl like that

982
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,624
should be in league
with a madman.

983
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,833
- Which is why
I do not suppose it.

984
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:38,749
- A good-looking girl
has a hard time of it.

985
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,749
- Ah, Hastings.

986
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,833
Always you are full
of the charitable feelings

987
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,083
to the young ladies
who are beautiful, huh?

988
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:48,458
As for me, I am always
full of the charitable feelings

989
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:51,499
to the old ladies
that have the maladies.

990
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,999
- Mr. Poirot.

991
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:22,583
- Monsieur Fraser.

992
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,958
- I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.

993
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:29,124
- Come up to the apartment,
Monsieur Fraser.

994
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,499
- Mr. Poirot,

995
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,291
do you know anything
about dreams?

996
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:59,333
- I do.

997
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:01,791
You have been dreaming?

998
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:04,083
- I keep dreaming
the same dream.

999
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:08,416
I'm on the beach,
looking for Betty,

1000
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:13,249
and she's lost,
and I've got to find her.

1001
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:19,208
You see, I'm carrying
her belt in my hand,

1002
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:21,124
and then...

1003
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,208
- Yes?

1004
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:26,541
- She's there,

1005
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:30,374
sitting on the sand.

1006
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,333
I come up behind her.

1007
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:36,249
I slip the belt
'round her neck,

1008
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,291
and I pull

1009
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:40,791
and pull.

1010
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:44,874
- Go on.

1011
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,291
- She's dead.

1012
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,416
I've strangled her.

1013
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:54,708
And then her head falls back,

1014
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:57,291
and I see her face,

1015
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,166
and it's Megan.

1016
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:02,499
It's not Betty.

1017
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,249
It's awful.

1018
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,958
- Have your drink.

1019
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:22,249
- I mean, I could have had
a blackout.

1020
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:23,916
- Poirot...

1021
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:24,958
It's come,

1022
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,124
the fourth letter.

1023
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,166
- Read it, Hastings.

1024
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:30,333
Quickly.

1025
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:31,749
- "Mr. Hercule Poirot,

1026
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:32,874
"Still no success.

1027
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,124
"Fie!
Fie!

1028
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,666
"What are you
and the police doing?

1029
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,124
"Isn't this fun?

1030
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,916
"And where shall we go next
for honey?

1031
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:40,083
"Poor Mr. Poirot.

1032
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:41,624
"I'm quite sorry for you.

1033
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,666
"We have a long way to go still.

1034
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:46,333
"The next little incident
will take place at Doncaster

1035
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,416
"on the 9th of September.

1036
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,666
So long,
A.B.C."

1037
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,041
- Perhaps our little band
of helpers

1038
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,249
will have something
to do after all.

1039
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,708
- Where does Mr. Poirot
keep his cups?

1040
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,916
- Uh, top cupboard, over there.

1041
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:35,874
- Saucers?

1042
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,458
- Uh, bottom cupboard,
over there.

1043
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:42,166
Everything's arranged
in order of height.

1044
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,166
- By George, Poirot.

1045
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:50,708
This is a bit of a stewer.

1046
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,833
Doncaster on the 9th?

1047
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:55,833
- Oh.
- I can get it.

1048
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:58,041
- Thanks.

1049
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,749
- What are you doing here?

1050
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:08,749
- Ah.

1051
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,249
- What is this, a convention?

1052
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,708
- Good day, Chief Inspector.

1053
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:14,541
- Maybe.

1054
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:19,291
- We've formed an association
of our own to deal with this,

1055
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:22,249
a legion
of interested parties.

1056
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,624
- Oh, yes?

1057
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,958
- But I rather fancy old A.B.C.
has done for you again.

1058
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:32,166
- Well, as a matter fact,
Mr. Clarke,

1059
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:34,166
I must beg to differ.

1060
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:35,624
I mean, correct me
if I'm wrong,

1061
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,499
but the 9th isn't until
Wednesday of next week, is it?

1062
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,416
And that seems to give us
plenty of time

1063
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,666
to mount a publicity campaign
in the press

1064
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,499
and plenty of time

1065
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,499
to warn the inhabitants
of Doncaster,

1066
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:50,083
particularly those whose names
begin with the letter D.

1067
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:53,166
- Well, it's easy to see
you are not a sporting man,

1068
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,374
Chief Inspector.

1069
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,333
- If, however you--

1070
00:57:57,459 --> 00:57:59,374
What do you mean?

1071
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,999
- Next Wednesday is the day

1072
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:04,624
the St. Leger
is being run at Doncaster.

1073
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,666
- Oh.

1074
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:09,166
- Yes, I was wondering
about that.

1075
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:11,708
- Tea, Chief Inspector?

1076
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:13,541
- Merci.

1077
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:18,124
- I mean, the whole of Doncaster
is like a fairground.

1078
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,458
- C'est ingenieux.

1079
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,041
He has planned
this most cleverly.

1080
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:30,916
- It's my belief the murder will
take place at the racecourse,

1081
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:34,041
perhaps actually while
the Leger is being run.

1082
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:35,958
Thank you.

1083
00:58:36,084 --> 00:58:39,583
- Yes, well, of course,
the St. Leger is a complication.

1084
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:43,249
However...

1085
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,458
I better get back to the Yard.

1086
00:58:48,209 --> 00:58:50,291
Thank you very much.

1087
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,124
Everything's under control.

1088
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,333
- We don't know
anything about the murderer,

1089
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:11,874
and that's the problem.

1090
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,041
We've gone over everything
we do know again and again.

1091
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:16,166
We've talked--

1092
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,333
- Not everything, monsieur.

1093
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:20,999
For instance,
Mademoiselle Grey here

1094
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,958
has told us that she did not see
or speak to any stranger

1095
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:26,583
on the day that Sir Carmichael
Clarke was killed.

1096
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,249
- That's right;
I didn't.

1097
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,999
- But Lady Clarke tells us,
mademoiselle,

1098
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,791
that on that day,
from her window,

1099
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,458
she saw you standing
at the garden gates

1100
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:38,416
speaking to a strange man.

1101
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,041
- Lady Clarke made a mistake.

1102
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,124
I never spoke--

1103
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,624
Oh.

1104
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,083
Oh, I remember now.
How stupid...

1105
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,374
Oh, but it wasn't important.

1106
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,916
Just one of those men who come
around selling stockings.

1107
00:59:57,042 --> 01:00:00,291
You know, ex-army people.

1108
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:01,416
They're very persistent,

1109
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:03,166
but he was quite
a harmless sort of person.

1110
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,916
I suppose that's why
I forgot about him.

1111
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:07,791
Stockings.

1112
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,749
Stockings.

1113
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:11,166
Stockings.
Stockings!

1114
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,499
Ca vient!
Stockings!

1115
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,166
Stockings!
That is the link.

1116
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:18,458
Do you not remember,
Hastings, Andover?

1117
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:20,541
The room behind the little shop?

1118
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:24,541
Over the back of the chair,
a pair of new silk stockings?

1119
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:25,666
- Well, yes, but--

1120
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:26,833
- Now I remember
what it was

1121
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,541
that aroused my attention
two days ago.

1122
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:29,583
It was you, mademoiselle.

1123
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,541
You spoke of your mother
who wept

1124
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,916
because, on the very day
of the murder,

1125
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:34,249
she had just bought
for your sister

1126
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,458
a pair of new silk stockings.

1127
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:38,624
- Yes.
Yes, she did.

1128
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,874
She said something
about feeling sorry

1129
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,666
for those wretched men who go
around selling door-to-door.

1130
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,333
- Describe this man.

1131
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:53,708
- I can't.
I don't...

1132
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:58,874
He had glasses, I think,
and a shabby overcoat.

1133
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,666
- Mieux que ca, mademoiselle.

1134
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,083
- He stooped.

1135
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,124
I don't know.

1136
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,666
I hardly looked at him.

1137
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,374
He wasn't the sort of man
you'd notice.

1138
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,583
- Ah!

1139
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,708
In those few words,
mademoiselle,

1140
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,499
lies the whole secret
of these murders.

1141
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:17,499
He wasn't the sort of man
you'd notice.

1142
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,916
Oh, yes,
there is no doubt about it.

1143
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:24,624
You have just described
the murderer.

1144
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:45,333
- I was wondering, Mr. Cust,
if you'd finished your...

1145
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:48,666
You all right, Mr. Cust?

1146
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,249
- I just feel
a bit out of sorts.

1147
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,624
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1148
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,583
You won't be going away
today then?

1149
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:58,124
- Oh, yes.

1150
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:03,291
I have to go.

1151
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:06,291
I'm going to Cheltenham.

1152
01:02:06,417 --> 01:02:07,499
- Oh, that's nice.

1153
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,499
Cheltenham's nice.

1154
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,624
Got some nice shops.

1155
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,374
Terrible, the news nowadays,
isn't it?

1156
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,374
Nothing but this murder
business.

1157
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,583
Gives me the creeps.

1158
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:20,583
I don't read it.
- No.

1159
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:22,583
- Doncaster, he says his next
murder's gonna be,

1160
01:02:22,709 --> 01:02:25,541
if you please,
and tomorrow.

1161
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:28,666
If I lived in Doncaster
and my name began with a D,

1162
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,791
I'd take the first train out,
I would.

1163
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:34,999
For all the hundreds of police
they say they're drafting in...

1164
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,958
Mr. Cust, you do look bad.

1165
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:45,291
Really, now, you oughtn't
to go traveling today.

1166
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:48,958
- It is necessary,
Mrs. Marbury.

1167
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:51,749
When I undertake
to do a thing,

1168
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,874
I follow it through.

1169
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,041
- Oh, well.

1170
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,499
If you say so, Mr. Cust.

1171
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,333
- What a fool I was!

1172
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,624
I've let you all down.

1173
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:58,583
I never really looked at him.

1174
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,208
Even if I saw him again,

1175
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:02,333
I probably wouldn't
recognize him.

1176
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:04,249
- Now, now, petite

1177
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,624
Do not upset yourself.

1178
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,166
So far, the luck, it has been on
the side of the murderer, yes,

1179
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,374
but sooner or later,
I believe it must turn

1180
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,833
and be on our side.

1181
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:17,416
In fact, I believe
that it has turned.

1182
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:20,666
The clue of the stockings
is the beginning.

1183
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,624
- Doncaster.
Doncaster.

1184
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,833
This is Doncaster.

1185
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:11,374
- Brought your private army
along, I see, Poirot.

1186
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,041
- Chief Inspector Japp,
my dear friend,

1187
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,083
we did not know
that you were on this train.

1188
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:16,958
- Why, you tossed down
that as much,

1189
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:19,874
what's going on down among
the workers, I suppose.

1190
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:40,874
- Meanwhile,
Mademoiselle Barnard

1191
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,249
will be patrolling the area
around the grandstand,

1192
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:50,708
and Monsieur Fraser will be
by the parade ring.

1193
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:53,666
- It seems to me
highly problematical

1194
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:56,041
that we can do anything
of practical value.

1195
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:58,624
- Don't be defeatist, Donald.

1196
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:02,124
- Our weapon is our knowledge,
Monsieur Fraser.

1197
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,666
But, remember,
it may be a knowledge

1198
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:06,208
we do not know
that we possess.

1199
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:07,374
Eh, bien.

1200
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,291
That is all we can do
for this evening.

1201
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:11,999
I bid you all good night.

1202
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,583
- Good night, Poirot.

1203
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,041
- Good night, Hastings.

1204
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:19,999
- Good night.
- Good night.

1205
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:34,374
- Look here, Mr. Poirot.

1206
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,166
When you went down
to Churston last week,

1207
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:40,374
did my sister-in-law
sort of, well--

1208
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,833
I mean, did she hint at all?

1209
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:44,041
- Comment?

1210
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,958
Did Lady Clarke hint at what?

1211
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:48,541
- Well, you see, Thora...

1212
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:54,291
Miss Grey is a rather
good-looking girl.

1213
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:56,874
- Perhaps, yes.

1214
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,166
Please, seat yourself.

1215
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:02,333
- As my brother always said,

1216
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,124
she was the best secretary
he ever had,

1217
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,666
but it was all perfectly
straight and above-board.

1218
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,333
- But of course.

1219
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,874
- But my sister-in-law
got it into her head

1220
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,666
to be, well, jealous,
I suppose.

1221
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:17,958
Anyway, after Car's death,

1222
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:21,458
when there was a question
of Miss Grey staying on,

1223
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:24,499
Charlotte cut up rough.

1224
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,208
- Cut up?

1225
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,708
- Rough.

1226
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,458
- Oh.

1227
01:07:31,584 --> 01:07:35,208
- Well, women really are devils,
Mr. Poirot.

1228
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:36,708
- Please, Monsieur Clarke,

1229
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:38,999
remember that Lady Clarke
is ill and in great pain.

1230
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,624
- I know.

1231
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,958
I keep telling myself that.

1232
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:48,291
Still I didn't want you to get
a false impression of Thora

1233
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:51,166
from anything
my sister-in-law may have said.

1234
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:54,083
- Oh.

1235
01:07:54,209 --> 01:07:56,208
I can assure you,
Monsieur Clarke,

1236
01:07:56,334 --> 01:07:58,874
that Poirot never permits
himself to get false impressions

1237
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,791
from anything anyone says.

1238
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:02,791
- Good man.

1239
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:04,749
Good man.

1240
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,291
Good night, Mr. Poirot.

1241
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,499
- Good night, Monsieur Clarke.

1242
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:38,041
I cannot impress upon you enough
to let your instincts rule.

1243
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,374
If you should see anyone

1244
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,499
who fits the description
of the stocking salesman,

1245
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:44,458
you must report to the police
but immediately.

1246
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:46,374
Even if you see someone
who looks familiar

1247
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,499
but you cannot quite place,

1248
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,291
even that is of significance.

1249
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:53,291
- He'll never attempt it now

1250
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:55,541
with a racecourse
full of police.

1251
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,791
The man would have to be mad.

1252
01:08:57,917 --> 01:09:00,333
- Unfortunately, he is mad.

1253
01:09:00,459 --> 01:09:02,624
- In my opinion,

1254
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,791
the obsession of the murderer
is so strong

1255
01:09:05,917 --> 01:09:09,166
that he must attempt
to carry out what he promises.

1256
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,749
Failure to do so would be
to admit defeat,

1257
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:16,874
and that, his insane
egoism would never permit.

1258
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,249
Ah, Mademoiselle Grey.

1259
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,541
- I'm sorry.
- No matter.

1260
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:26,166
You are only 4 1/2 minutes late.

1261
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:29,749
Eh, bien.

1262
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:31,499
It is time for you
to take your places.

1263
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,374
I wish you good luck.

1264
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,124
- What about you, Poirot?

1265
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,249
- No, Hastings.

1266
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:43,583
My force, it is in my brains,
not in my feet.

1267
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:45,666
We will meet at 3:00
as arranged.

1268
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,874
- Very well.

1269
01:11:02,584 --> 01:11:03,833
- 32 yards,

1270
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:07,499
with winning prize money
this year of 10,000 pounds...

1271
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,791
The strongly fancied
Rogue Scotland,

1272
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,874
owned by Lord Astor,

1273
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,041
in company with Fearless Fox
ridden by F. Smith,

1274
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:22,708
and Back on the Rails
ridden by Gordon Richards.

1275
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:25,124
And here comes the winner
of this year's derby,

1276
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:29,041
the great half--in the colors
of his Royal Highness...

1277
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:45,583
And they're off!

1278
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:48,874
His Grace leads very smartly
on the inside.

1279
01:11:58,459 --> 01:11:59,833
His Grace settled now
in midfield.

1280
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:01,708
Flying Fox tucked away
on the inside...

1281
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,458
He's making it
by two legs to one...

1282
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:27,374
- Hastings!
Hastings!

1283
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,541
Excuse me.
Hastings!

1284
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,416
- It's all right.
Everyone's in position.

1285
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,374
- No, no, no, Hastings,
you do not understand.

1286
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,624
Look at the crowds.

1287
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,499
- Well, yes, I know.
It's jammed everywhere.

1288
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,374
It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1289
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,708
- Yes, Hastings, yes!

1290
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:42,583
Where is the best place
for a man to hide himself?

1291
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:44,166
- In a crowd of other men?

1292
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:47,916
- Yes, Hastings, and where's the
best place to conceal a murder?

1293
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:49,624
- A murder?
I don't know.

1294
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,708
Among a lot of other murders,
I suppose.

1295
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,374
- Prcisement, Hastings.

1296
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,458
At Churston, I said
that the victims were chosen

1297
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,708
in a manner
that was haphazard,

1298
01:12:57,834 --> 01:12:59,916
selected only because
of their initials, yes?

1299
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,333
I was wrong, Hastings.

1300
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,416
All of the victims are
haphazard, yes, except for one.

1301
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:07,416
This monster is committing
a series of murders

1302
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:09,249
in order to draw away
our attention

1303
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,249
from one murder in particular.

1304
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:17,416
- Excuse me.

1305
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:23,958
Excuse me.

1306
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,041
- Now then, sir.

1307
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:28,416
Show's over.

1308
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:29,791
I think he's ill.

1309
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:31,791
Hey, we better, erm...

1310
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:38,624
By Hank,
that looks like blood!

1311
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,833
- Look what's under his seat.

1312
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,333
- It's an A.B.C.

1313
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:23,999
- What time?

1314
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,541
Right, I'll be right over.

1315
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:51,749
- Eh, I've washed already
in cold.

1316
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,458
Eh, I cut my hand.

1317
01:16:57,584 --> 01:16:59,124
- You all right, sir?

1318
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:19,083
- Just tell us what happened,
please, Mr. Downes.

1319
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:23,249
- There's a woman
to see you, sir.

1320
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,958
Says it's urgent.

1321
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,249
- When was this?

1322
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,249
- Oh, about 4:15.

1323
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,624
- Well, that's three hours ago.

1324
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,333
- Well, I didn't think of it
at the time.

1325
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:35,499
Not until I'd heard
there'd been another murder.

1326
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:37,624
But he said he'd cut his hand.

1327
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,749
- If you please, madam,
can you describe this man?

1328
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,374
- Well, he's tall,
and he stoops,

1329
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,916
and he wears glasses.

1330
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:45,666
- And his clothes?

1331
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:48,291
- A dark suit and overcoat
and an homburg hat.

1332
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:50,499
A bit shabby-looking.

1333
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:56,833
- Looks like blood, sir.

1334
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:57,916
- Get it analyzed.

1335
01:17:58,042 --> 01:17:59,999
- Poirot, we found it.

1336
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,624
We found the name
in the register.

1337
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,791
- What is it?
- Look.

1338
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,374
- A.B. Case.

1339
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,999
- Or is it Cash?

1340
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:11,041
- Well, It's A.B.C. anyway.

1341
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,916
- Case, Cast...

1342
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:16,833
- And a London address:
17 Market Street, Southwark.

1343
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,791
- There's a suitcase
under the bed, sir.

1344
01:18:18,917 --> 01:18:20,541
- Get it out,
and let's have a look.

1345
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:31,208
Stockings.
Silk stockings.

1346
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:34,166
You were right, Poirot.

1347
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:37,583
- Something else here, sir,
right at the back.

1348
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:39,249
It's a knife.

1349
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,583
- Don't touch it.

1350
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:42,791
Get the bed out.

1351
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:54,041
- It was funny, though.

1352
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:56,874
The way he said good-bye,

1353
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,708
as if he'd never see us again.

1354
01:19:00,834 --> 01:19:03,708
Told me he was going
to Cheltenham.

1355
01:19:03,834 --> 01:19:06,333
Poor Mr. Cust.

1356
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:08,583
I can't believe it.

1357
01:19:39,959 --> 01:19:42,166
Terrible,
the news nowadays, isn't it?

1358
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:43,666
Nothing but this murder
business.

1359
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:44,874
Gives me the creeps, it does.

1360
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,916
- You'll be watched.

1361
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:46,999
You'll be questioned.

1362
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,208
You'll be followed.

1363
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:50,791
You've been very careful.

1364
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:52,374
- But you never know
with lunatics.

1365
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,458
Nasty business, eh?

1366
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:04,374
- Your fate,
it's written.

1367
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,291
It's written in your hand.

1368
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,749
You've got to admit,

1369
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:13,208
most celebrated man in England.

1370
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:15,374
I die on the gallows.

1371
01:20:18,209 --> 01:20:21,374
- I killed Lily James,

1372
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:25,166
and now I am going to kill--
Kill!

1373
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:26,416
Kill!

1374
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:02,041
- So that's that.
Committed for trial.

1375
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:04,791
- Chief Inspector, what is
your opinion of Monsieur Cust?

1376
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:07,874
- That he's playing
a very crafty game.

1377
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,208
He's an epileptic,
the doctors tell me.

1378
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:12,416
- But is it possible
for a man to commit a crime

1379
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:13,958
without being aware of it?

1380
01:21:14,084 --> 01:21:16,083
- Well, he might try
that line of defense

1381
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:17,458
if it wasn't for the letters.

1382
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:18,958
They show premeditation.

1383
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:22,374
- And of those letters, we still
have no explanation whatsoever.

1384
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,333
Until I have a reason for those
letters being written to me,

1385
01:21:25,459 --> 01:21:29,083
I will not feel
that this case is solved.

1386
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,749
There's a Mr. Strange waiting
in your office, sir.

1387
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,958
He says it's urgent.

1388
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,499
- Chief Inspector Japp.

1389
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,041
- That's me.

1390
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:57,249
- It's about
that Bexhill murder.

1391
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,249
- He swears
by all that's blue

1392
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,541
that he met Cust
in the Royal George Hotel

1393
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:08,416
in Eastbourne on the evening
of August the 24th,

1394
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,208
that they had dinner together,

1395
01:22:10,334 --> 01:22:12,583
and then played dominoes
until well after midnight.

1396
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:14,124
- And if he is telling
the truth,

1397
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,416
Monsieur Cust could not have
been on the beach at Bexhill

1398
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:17,999
between 12:00 and 1:00,

1399
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,958
strangling
Mademoiselle Betty Barnard.

1400
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:21,999
- Listen,
he did the Andover murder.

1401
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,458
He did the Churston murder.

1402
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:24,999
He did the Doncaster murder.

1403
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:27,041
He must have done
the Bexhill murder.

1404
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:31,041
- Why?

1405
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:33,041
I don't know why.

1406
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:35,874
Because he's barmy, that's why.

1407
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:04,124
- Excuse me, Monsieur Cust.

1408
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,666
For they shall be comforted.

1409
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:09,416
- I am Hercule Poirot.

1410
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,874
- Oh, yes.

1411
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,833
- I am the man
to whom you wrote those letters.

1412
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:21,249
- I never wrote to you.

1413
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,374
I told them
over and over again.

1414
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,999
- If you did not write those
letters, Monsieur Cust,

1415
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,041
who did?

1416
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,708
- I don't know.

1417
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:32,833
They're all against me.

1418
01:23:32,959 --> 01:23:36,708
They always have been.

1419
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:40,708
- Even when you were a child?

1420
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,666
- No.

1421
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,874
But my mother was ambitious.

1422
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,916
She gave me
these ridiculous names.

1423
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:05,458
Alexander Bonaparte...

1424
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:07,333
Cust.

1425
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,833
She had some absurd notion

1426
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:11,374
that I would cut a figure
in the world.

1427
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,583
And what do I end up as?

1428
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:21,124
A door-to-door
stocking salesman.

1429
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:36,333
- You are aware,
are you not...

1430
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:42,041
that the firm who you say
employed you denied the fact?

1431
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,958
- Yes.

1432
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:46,083
But I've got their letters
to me,

1433
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:49,916
giving the instructions
as to what places to go

1434
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:52,874
and a list of people
upon whom to call.

1435
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,333
- But all of the letters,

1436
01:24:54,459 --> 01:24:56,708
they were typed on the machine
found in your room.

1437
01:24:56,834 --> 01:24:58,916
- The typewriter was sent to me
by the firm

1438
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:02,374
at the beginning of my job.

1439
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,749
- But the letters were sent
after you received the machine.

1440
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:08,166
So it looks, does it not,

1441
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:10,249
as though you typed them

1442
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:12,958
and then posted them
to yourself?

1443
01:25:13,084 --> 01:25:15,541
- Yes, I know.
I know.

1444
01:25:18,209 --> 01:25:21,791
But I couldn't have done the
second murder, though, could I?

1445
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:24,708
The Bexhill one.

1446
01:25:24,834 --> 01:25:28,874
I was playing dominoes
in Eastbourne, wasn't I?

1447
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:36,624
- It is a game
that is very absorbing,

1448
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:39,124
is it not, Monsieur Cust?

1449
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:43,791
- Oh, there's a lot of play
in it, a lot of play.

1450
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:45,958
When I was a clerk
in the city,

1451
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:49,499
we used to play
every lunch hour.

1452
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:50,791
You'd be surprised the way

1453
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:52,541
total strangers
can come together

1454
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:54,583
over a game of dominoes.

1455
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:56,041
- Oh?

1456
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:00,874
- Yes.

1457
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,083
I remember one person
in particular.

1458
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,541
We just got talking
over a cup of coffee

1459
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,249
and started dominoes.

1460
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:16,666
I've not been able to forget
something that he told me.

1461
01:26:16,792 --> 01:26:18,708
- What did he say?

1462
01:26:22,084 --> 01:26:29,583
- Talking about your fate
being written in your hand.

1463
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:34,624
Told me some amazing things.

1464
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,249
Said I was going to be

1465
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:40,749
the most celebrated man
in England before I died.

1466
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:42,041
But that...

1467
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,416
- Yes?

1468
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:47,249
- "It almost looks as though

1469
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:49,916
you're going to die
on the gallows."

1470
01:26:50,042 --> 01:26:53,791
That's it.

1471
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,374
Laughed afterwards.

1472
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,583
Said it was only a joke.

1473
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:05,749
But I suffer quite badly
from my head, do you know?

1474
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,666
I mean, there are times
when I don't...

1475
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:19,624
I don't seem to remember
what I've done.

1476
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:30,999
- But you do know
that you committed the murders.

1477
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:34,374
- Yes.

1478
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,041
Yes, I do know that.

1479
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:40,083
- And I am right,
am I not,

1480
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:45,208
that you do not know
why you committed them?

1481
01:27:45,334 --> 01:27:48,083
- No.

1482
01:27:48,209 --> 01:27:50,291
No, I don't.

1483
01:27:59,584 --> 01:28:02,833
- I'm not having
that dream anymore.

1484
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:03,874
- No.

1485
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,374
All that will disappear
with time.

1486
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,708
- I don't want
to forget Betty, though.

1487
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:13,708
- No.

1488
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:15,749
We won't forget her.

1489
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:20,124
- Here he is.

1490
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,708
- About ruddy time too.

1491
01:28:21,834 --> 01:28:23,916
I don't know what
this is in aid of, Poirot.

1492
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:26,208
The case is over,
done with, finished.

1493
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,708
- That is true, Chief Inspector.

1494
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:28,999
The man, Cust,
he is in prison.

1495
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,458
There will be no more killings.
Finished.

1496
01:28:31,584 --> 01:28:33,374
But, you see, I know nothing.

1497
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,749
And there is also one small fact
that is vexing.

1498
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:39,458
Monsieur Cust has an alibi
for the night of the crime

1499
01:28:39,584 --> 01:28:42,749
that he is alleged
to have committed on this beach.

1500
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:44,083
From the beginning,

1501
01:28:44,209 --> 01:28:45,874
I have felt
that there was something wrong

1502
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,374
with those letters
that I received.

1503
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,708
And there was.

1504
01:28:48,834 --> 01:28:50,708
I had assumed that they were
written by a madman.

1505
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:52,083
Mais non.

1506
01:28:52,209 --> 01:28:55,333
They were written by a sane man
pretending to be mad.

1507
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:05,541
When do you notice least
a pin?

1508
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,874
- Shh!

1509
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,958
Don't clatter so, Millie.

1510
01:29:09,084 --> 01:29:11,124
- When it is in a pincushion.

1511
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:15,749
When do you notice least
an individual murder?

1512
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:21,499
When it is one of a series
of related murders.

1513
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,291
- Hold on a minute.
Hold on.

1514
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:25,541
Cust did the murders.

1515
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:28,416
He was caught red-handed,
more or less.

1516
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:30,583
Blood on his coat,
knife under his bed.

1517
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:31,916
He even admits
to the murders.

1518
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:33,374
What more do you want?

1519
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,624
- When I first saw
Monsieur Cust, Chief Inspector,

1520
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,083
I knew he was not guilty.

1521
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:40,583
For such a plan, Monsieur Cust
had neither the cunning,

1522
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,166
the daring,
nor, may I add, the brains.

1523
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:49,333
The murderer must have flirted
with Mademoiselle Betty Barnard.

1524
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:51,291
Somehow he got her
to remove her belt

1525
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:54,749
with which she was strangled.

1526
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,666
You have seen Monsieur Cust.

1527
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,541
Can you imagine Monsieur Cust,
as you English say,

1528
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:04,624
getting off
with a pretty young girl?

1529
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,208
Monsieur Cust making the click?

1530
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:10,541
- Mr. Poirot, please.

1531
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:12,083
- All along,

1532
01:30:12,209 --> 01:30:15,499
I was aware of a dual
personality of the murderer.

1533
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:19,499
Now I see wherein
it consisted.

1534
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,708
Two people were involved.

1535
01:30:24,834 --> 01:30:29,583
The real murderer: cunning,
resourceful, and daring.

1536
01:30:29,709 --> 01:30:31,291
And the pseudo murderer:

1537
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:34,416
stupid, vacillating,
and above all,

1538
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:37,249
suggestible.

1539
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:39,874
The murderer
had been considering

1540
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,833
already several schemes

1541
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:47,166
when a chance meeting with
Monsieur Cust produced an idea.

1542
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:50,291
His epileptic seizures,
his headaches,

1543
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:54,041
indeed the whole shrinking
personality of Monsieur Cust

1544
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:57,499
made him, for the murderer,
an ideal tool.

1545
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,999
Perhaps his very name
of Alexander Bonaparte Cust

1546
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:09,416
gave to the murderer the idea
of the murders alphabetical.

1547
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:17,374
The arrangements
were excellent.

1548
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,374
Some letters were sent
to Monsieur Cust,

1549
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,124
as if from a well-known
wholesaler,

1550
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,416
offering him employment
on salary and commission.

1551
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:29,583
In fact, the plans were so well
laid down beforehand

1552
01:31:29,709 --> 01:31:31,666
by the murderer

1553
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:34,708
that the letters that were
subsequently sent to me

1554
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:36,624
had already been typed.

1555
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:41,124
And afterwards, the typewriter
that was used for the purpose

1556
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:47,458
was sent to Monsieur Cust,
allegedly to use for business.

1557
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:53,749
The preliminary plans
completed,

1558
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,999
the murder then set to work.

1559
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,583
A list of potential clients
in Andover

1560
01:31:59,709 --> 01:32:01,999
is sent to Monsieur Cust,

1561
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:08,708
and he is instructed to go there
on August the 21st.

1562
01:32:08,834 --> 01:32:13,749
Monsieur Cust does
as he is directed.

1563
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:17,416
And later that day,
Madam Ascher,

1564
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:20,791
she is murdered most brutally.

1565
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,666
- A few days later,

1566
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:33,708
he is instructed to go
to Bexhill-on-Sea,

1567
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:38,416
and on that particular list
of clients is Madam Barnard.

1568
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:42,833
That night,

1569
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:46,249
Mademoiselle Betty Barnard
is strangled with her own belt

1570
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:49,124
on the beach.

1571
01:32:55,334 --> 01:32:59,041
- At Churston,
Lady Clarke observes

1572
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:01,874
Mademoiselle Grey
talking with Monsieur Cust,

1573
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,208
and Sir Carmichael Clarke,
he also dies.

1574
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:17,958
- Three crimes,

1575
01:33:18,084 --> 01:33:23,458
and Monsieur Cust is at
the scene of each one of them.

1576
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:27,791
So...

1577
01:33:27,917 --> 01:33:30,958
I was then forced back
to the simple question:

1578
01:33:31,084 --> 01:33:33,041
Cui bono?

1579
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:37,041
Who stood to gain anything
from even one of the murders?

1580
01:33:39,917 --> 01:33:43,083
Madam Ascher had no money,

1581
01:33:43,209 --> 01:33:45,083
so therefore, you,
Mademoiselle Drower,

1582
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:48,374
had nothing to gain
from the death of your aunt.

1583
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,708
Mademoiselle Betty Barnard?

1584
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:52,958
Eh, bien.

1585
01:33:53,084 --> 01:33:54,333
She was not rich

1586
01:33:54,459 --> 01:33:56,791
and lived on the no doubt
niggardly salary

1587
01:33:56,917 --> 01:34:00,083
paid to her
by the De La Warr Pavilion.

1588
01:34:00,209 --> 01:34:04,958
Sir Carmichael Clarke now...

1589
01:34:05,084 --> 01:34:07,041
Well, as the newspapers
endlessly informed us,

1590
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:11,708
Sir Carmichael Clarke was
a millionaire many times over.

1591
01:34:11,834 --> 01:34:13,208
- What are you suggesting?

1592
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:15,958
- Persons suffering from
epilepsy, Mademoiselle Grey,

1593
01:34:16,084 --> 01:34:18,708
often have blanks
when they cannot remember

1594
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:20,541
what they have just done.

1595
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:24,166
Monsieur Cust
suffered from these.

1596
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:29,208
He was also nervous,
highly neurotic,

1597
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:34,458
and extremely suggestible.

1598
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:37,041
The Andover crime
meant to him at first nothing.

1599
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:38,291
The Bexhill crime?

1600
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,749
Well, he was there
at about the same time.

1601
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,958
And then came Churston.

1602
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:49,208
So when he receives instructions
to go to Doncaster,

1603
01:34:49,334 --> 01:34:50,749
knowing as he does

1604
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:54,124
that the next A.B.C. murder
will take place in that city,

1605
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,624
he loses his nerve.

1606
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,833
He begins to imagine
that his landlady

1607
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:00,916
is looking at him
in a manner most suspicious,

1608
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,291
and he tells her that
he is going to Cheltenham.

1609
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:05,958
- Just as you say, Mr. Cust.

1610
01:35:06,084 --> 01:35:08,499
- And this is where
the understanding

1611
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,083
of the personality
of Monsieur Cust

1612
01:35:10,209 --> 01:35:12,666
by the murderer
pays dividends.

1613
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:14,624
In spite of every inner voice

1614
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,583
telling Monsieur Cust
not to go to Doncaster,

1615
01:35:17,709 --> 01:35:19,166
nevertheless, he goes.

1616
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:20,374
Why does he go?

1617
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,749
Because it is his duty.

1618
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:28,291
Monsieur Cust
goes to a cinema.

1619
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:38,124
And when the film comes
to an end,

1620
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:42,791
he starts to leave.

1621
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:45,208
But while his back is turned,

1622
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:50,749
There occurs the stabbing
of the fourth victim.

1623
01:35:59,459 --> 01:36:02,666
- Excuse me.

1624
01:36:02,792 --> 01:36:04,666
- By killing four people,

1625
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:07,124
our murderer
hoped to disguise

1626
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:09,708
the one murder
with a real motive.

1627
01:36:09,834 --> 01:36:13,583
that of your brother,
Sir Carmichael Clarke.

1628
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:17,999
- But who is this murderer
you keep talking about?

1629
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:24,958
You're not implying it's me?

1630
01:36:25,084 --> 01:36:27,249
Well, I couldn't have killed
that fellow in the cinema.

1631
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:30,499
I was at the racecourse
with the rest of you.

1632
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:34,124
- Indeed you were,
Monsieur Clarke.

1633
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,374
And the murderer stayed in place
at the racecourse

1634
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:39,374
until the crowds
began to gather.

1635
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,874
Soon it would be impossible

1636
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,208
to check on the movements
of anyone,

1637
01:36:44,334 --> 01:36:47,916
and our murderer,
he quietly slips away.

1638
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:52,458
In the letter that Monsieur Cust
received

1639
01:36:52,584 --> 01:36:54,624
from his soit disant employer,

1640
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:57,124
he is instructed
at which hotel to stay,

1641
01:36:57,250 --> 01:37:00,124
so there is no difficulty
in picking him up.

1642
01:37:04,459 --> 01:37:10,708
Our murderer follows
Monsieur Cust to the cinema,

1643
01:37:10,834 --> 01:37:11,916
and in the darkness,

1644
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:15,124
he cold-bloodedly
takes his opportunity.

1645
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,749
And when the program
comes to an end,

1646
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:23,916
and Monsieur Cust is leaving,

1647
01:37:24,042 --> 01:37:27,749
he does not realize that the
person he passes in the aisle

1648
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:32,583
also slips into his pocket
a knife.

1649
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:45,874
- This is rot!

1650
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,458
I've never heard
such out-and-out rot!

1651
01:37:48,584 --> 01:37:51,083
- No, Monsieur Clarke,

1652
01:37:51,209 --> 01:37:53,624
you were safe enough

1653
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,624
and almost certain to inherit
the wealth of your brother

1654
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,374
as long as
no one suspected you.

1655
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,833
But as soon
as you were suspected,

1656
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:05,749
the proofs,
they were easy to find.

1657
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,583
- Proofs?

1658
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:09,458
You haven't got any proofs.

1659
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:10,833
What proofs?

1660
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:14,124
- Your fingerprints,
Monsieur Clarke.

1661
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,874
They were discovered
on the typewriter

1662
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,666
that was sent
to Monsieur Cust.

1663
01:38:17,792 --> 01:38:20,749
The typewriter, which,
if you were innocent,

1664
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:24,166
you could never have handled.

1665
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:27,291
- You little...

1666
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:29,458
jackanapes!

1667
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,999
- There he is!

1668
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:36,333
Come on.
After him!

1669
01:39:36,459 --> 01:39:37,916
Wilkinson!

1670
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:40,458
Get him!

1671
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,874
- Well, that's that,
I suppose.

1672
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:14,083
- Can't believe it.

1673
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:19,583
I just can't believe it.

1674
01:40:19,709 --> 01:40:22,374
- He was afraid,
Mademoiselle Grey.

1675
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,666
He was afraid that while the
cancer took care of Lady Clarke,

1676
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:28,083
his brother, Sir Carmichael,

1677
01:40:28,209 --> 01:40:29,999
might have turned
his attentions towards you,

1678
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:32,291
might even perhaps
have married you.

1679
01:40:32,417 --> 01:40:36,999
Then his hopes of inheritance,
it would be lost forever.

1680
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:38,833
By killing his brother,

1681
01:40:38,959 --> 01:40:40,416
Monsieur Franklin Clarke
ensures

1682
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:43,249
that when the cancer finally
overcomes Lady Clarke,

1683
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:46,916
the family fortune,
it will be his.

1684
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:49,874
- Mr. Poirot...

1685
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,124
I understand why he wrote
all those letters,

1686
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,374
because without them,

1687
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,249
the murders wouldn't have seemed
connected.

1688
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:58,208
What I don't understand
is why he wrote them to you.

1689
01:40:58,334 --> 01:41:00,291
Why not to Scotland Yard?

1690
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:02,208
- Because, mon ami,
you could not even arrange

1691
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:04,999
for a letter addressed to
Scotland Yard to go astray.

1692
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,624
Even the least-well-oriented
postman would know

1693
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:09,791
where to deliver it.

1694
01:41:09,917 --> 01:41:11,999
- It was the very essence
of the plan of Monsieur Clarke

1695
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:14,374
that the third letter,
it should go astray.

1696
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,499
The police were not to be told
about the one murder

1697
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:21,041
with the real motive
until it was safely over.

1698
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:24,666
Alas, it had nothing to do
with my undoubted fame.

1699
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:25,916
No.

1700
01:41:26,042 --> 01:41:29,333
Merely, he needed
a private address.

1701
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,499
- It was the fingerprint
on the typewriter

1702
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,249
that really clinched things,
of course.

1703
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,708
- Ah, the fingerprints, yes.

1704
01:41:35,834 --> 01:41:37,416
They are useful.

1705
01:41:37,542 --> 01:41:40,333
I put that in to please you,
Hastings.

1706
01:41:40,459 --> 01:41:42,416
- You mean it wasn't true?

1707
01:41:42,542 --> 01:41:45,374
- Not in the least, mon ami.

1708
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,083
- Good Lord.

1709
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,583
Well, if you don't want it
on the sideboard,

1710
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:08,208
where do you want it?

1711
01:42:08,334 --> 01:42:10,249
- It's the smell, Hastings.

1712
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:12,333
It does not seem to fade.

1713
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,791
- Oh, it's early days yet,
Poirot.

1714
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:16,999
I gave him a bit of a spray
with some cologne yesterday.

1715
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:18,291
- Whose cologne, Hastings?

1716
01:42:18,417 --> 01:42:20,124
- Well, it was, um...

1717
01:42:21,917 --> 01:42:23,999
I'll just...

1718
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,958
Hello, Chief Inspector.

1719
01:42:35,084 --> 01:42:36,999
- Captain Hastings.

1720
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:39,333
Morning, Poirot.

1721
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:40,916
I brought someone to see you.

1722
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:42,374
- Monsieur Cust!

1723
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:46,166
- I just had to come and say
thank you, Mr. Poirot.

1724
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:47,624
You are a very great man.

1725
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,749
- Oh, he knows that.

1726
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:52,874
- Thank you very much,
Monsieur Cust.

1727
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,916
Oh!

1728
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:55,541
Merci!

1729
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,624
- If it hadn't been for you...

1730
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,916
Thank you.

1731
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:04,833
Do you know a newspaper
has offered me 100 pound--

1732
01:43:04,959 --> 01:43:06,416
100 pound--

1733
01:43:06,542 --> 01:43:08,874
for a brief account of my life
and experiences.

1734
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,999
- Oh.

1735
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:13,374
Do not accept, Monsieur Cust.

1736
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,916
You must stand firm.

1737
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:22,124
You must say to them that
your price is now 500 pounds.

1738
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,291
- Do you think so?

1739
01:43:23,417 --> 01:43:24,333
- Mais certainement!

1740
01:43:24,459 --> 01:43:25,874
Do you not realize,
Monsieur Cust,

1741
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,333
that today, you are
the most famous man in England?

1742
01:43:31,209 --> 01:43:33,041
- You're right.

1743
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:35,791
You're absolutely right.

1744
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,416
Famous.

1745
01:43:38,542 --> 01:43:39,708
Hmm.

1746
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:43,999
Well, I must say the money
will be most agreeable.

1747
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:47,499
I shall take a short holiday,
and...

1748
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:52,499
I say.

1749
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:55,458
What a creature!

1750
01:43:55,584 --> 01:43:57,208
- Do you like it?

1751
01:43:57,334 --> 01:43:59,958
- It's magnificent.

1752
01:44:00,084 --> 01:44:03,041
- I shot it,
as a matter of fact.

1753
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:04,999
- You shot it?

1754
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:07,416
- Yes, when
I was in South America.

1755
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:10,208
- Oh, I should like
to hear that story.

1756
01:44:10,334 --> 01:44:11,749
- Oh?

1757
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:12,833
Right.
Well.

1758
01:44:12,959 --> 01:44:15,083
Sit down, Mr. Cust.

1759
01:44:15,209 --> 01:44:16,999
It was when I was up
in Venezuela.

1760
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:19,249
We were a few miles upstream
of La Urbana,

1761
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:21,999
which is actually one of the
hottest places in the world.

1762
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:24,333
The humidity was
absolutely unbearable.

1763
01:44:24,459 --> 01:44:27,333
We'd been in portage around
white water all day.

1764
01:44:27,459 --> 01:44:29,249
I was pretty exhausted,
I can tell you.

1765
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,874
And suddenly, we rounded
a bend in the river

1766
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,041
and came upon
the most extraordinary sight.

1767
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:36,624
Just down below the rapids
was a native canoe

1768
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,416
obviously in some kind
of trouble,

1769
01:44:38,542 --> 01:44:41,166
and I suddenly realized
that they were being pursued

1770
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:43,166
by something rather horrid.
