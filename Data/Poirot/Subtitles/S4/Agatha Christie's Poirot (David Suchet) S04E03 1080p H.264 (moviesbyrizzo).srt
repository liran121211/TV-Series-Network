I lent him my hot water bottle
when he had a toothache.

[giggles]

158
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,884
Have you been to a dentist yet

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,684
about that tooth,
Mr. Amberiotis?

160
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,569
Not yet, no.

161
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,091
It doesn't hurt so much.

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,248
That's very naughty of you.

163
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,604
You must go and see my man,
Mr. Morley in Harley Street.

164
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,371
As a matter of fact,
it's rather a coincidence.

165
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,683
I saw him only this morning,
and as I was coming out,

166
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,246
I ran into another old friend
from India-

167
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,169
but from much longer ago,
of course.

168
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,930
His wife and I were together

169
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,923
in the touring company
I told you about.

170
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh, yes, yes.

171
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,564
When you were an actress.

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,045
Quite.

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,646
And he's done awfully well,
I believe, since then.

174
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,171
Mr. Alistair Blunt.

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,608
Mr. Alistair Blunt the banker?

176
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,324
I believe so.

177
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,046
He certainly used to work
in a bank when he met Gerda.

178
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,811
Gerda?

179
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,763
His wife.

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,690
Oh, we were such pals.

181
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,007
Of course, she was
a better actress than I.

182
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,851
I always said she'd get on
in the profession,

183
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,440
but she left it
to marry Alistair,

184
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,723
and I left it to stay in India.

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,603
Thank you, sir.

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,451
Hold tight, please.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,922
Oh.

188
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,241
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,249
My name's Sainsbury Seale.

190
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,521
I want to see Mrs. Blunt.

191
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,449
She's staying with Mrs. Chapman.

192
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,886
Mrs. Chapman, right.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,968
This way, ma'am.

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,082
Number 45, ma'am, just there.

195
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,407
Thank you so much.

196
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,330
Gerda!

197
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,888
After all these years.

198
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,370
[telephone rings]

199
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,767
Where are you going
with those?

200
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,689
Miss Sainsbury Seale
telephoned, miss.

201
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,251
She's moving
to the Carlisle Hotel

202
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,170
in South Kensington,
wants her bags sent on.

203
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,124
Oh, yes.
Go on, then.

204
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,889
That damn boy's late again.

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,447
And smoking
on the front doorstep.

206
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,126
Young people nowadays-

207
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,090
unreliable, self-centered.

208
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,411
The girls are as bad.

209
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,164
Gladys isn't coming in today.

210
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,641
Her aunt's had a stroke, and
she's had to go up to Yorkshire.

211
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,001
That's hardly
the girl's fault.

212
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,727
She's been different lately.

213
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,683
It's that Frank Carter fellow.

214
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,883
Girls do fall in love, Henry.

215
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,081
Love?

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,202
She's a cut above him,
I should hope.

217
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,163
You know he's in
with that Blackshirt mob.

218
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,442
Anyway, she shouldn't let it
affect her efficiency

219
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,045
as my secretary.

220
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,845
Let her fall in love
in her own time.

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,287
[knocking at door]

222
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,768
Good morning, Mr. Amberiotis.

223
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,325
Is everything all right, sir?

224
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,169
What?

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,442
No.

226
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,527
Yes, it's just a... toothache.

227
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,604
Take it away.

228
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,849
Girls: # Three, four,

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,122

# Seventeen, eighteen,

# Nineteen, twenty,

237
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,045
Thank you.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,885
<i>Mr. Por-oat?</i>

242
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,848
Till the end
of the financial year.

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,401
Thank you, Charles.

244
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,520
Any other business?

245
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,291
There's the question
of the debenture issue.

246
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,528
That was covered
on the agenda.

247
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,325
Yes, but we left
the date open.

248
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,965
Quite.

249
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,047
That's all, I think.

250
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,122
Meeting closed.

251
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,647
Thank you, gentlemen.

252
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,690
All right, Alistair?

253
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,040
All right?
Yes, I'm fine.

254
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,605
Can I give you a lift?

255
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,882
No, my car's waiting.
I'm going to the dentist.

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,004
I see. That's why you were
in such a bad mood.

257
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,206
We'll get your treatment
finished today, Mr. Poirot.

258
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,924
Now, as I was saying,

259
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,011
the important people,
they're always on time.

260
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,726
Now, I've got a most important
man coming this morning.

261
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,807
[grunts inquiringly]

262
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,126
Mr. Alistair Blunt.

263
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,571
[muffled]
Alistair Blunt?

264
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,647
Oh, yes.

265
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,962
Always on time.

266
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,447
Nice, unassuming fellow.

267
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,047
Often sends his Rolls away
and walks back to the office

268
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,446
just like you and me.

269
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,206
You would never dream
he could buy up half Europe.

270
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,127
[bell ringing]

271
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,931
Well, good-bye, Mr. Poirot.

272
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,246
Wasn't too bad this time,
was it?

273
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,367
No.

274
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,760
Shall I ring for the lift
for you?

275
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,405
No, no, no, thank you.
I shall walk down.

276
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,245
I'll see you in six months.

277
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,281
[buzzer buzzes]

278
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,246
Mr. Blunt.

279
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,688
Excuse me.

280
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,606
" Ooh!

281
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,200
Oh!

282
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,726
So kind.

283
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,080
Not at all, madame.

284
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,122
" Ooh!

285
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,049
Oh, dear.

286
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,286
Thank you.

287
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,521
You're welcome, madame.

288
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,404
Thank you so much.

289
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,568
Girls: # Nine, ten,

290
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,126
[bell ringing]

291
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,364
I have an appointment
with Mr. Morley.

292
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,442
Name?

293
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,241
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

294
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,644
[suspenseful music]

295
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:25,851
<i>[music]</i>

296
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,449
[laughs]

297
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,884
Well?

298
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,890
I have now been waiting
for 45 minutes.

299
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,685
My appointment
was for half past 12:00.

300
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,966
Well, I know-

301
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,128
- I shall now go back
to Worthing!

302
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,643
You may tell Mr. Morley
that I am most displeased.

303
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,089
"I am most displeased".

304
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,250
[knocks softly]

305
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,762
[knocks loudly]

306
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,128
Oh, my god.

307
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,166
Revolver grasped
in lifeless fingers.

308
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,760
Doesn't seem to be much doubt
about it, does there?

309
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,645
It has to be suicide.

310
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,683
<i>C'est incroyable.</i>

311
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,327
All right,
you can move him now.

312
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,523
So tell me,
Chief Inspector Japp.

313
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,041
Lived upstairs
with his sister.

314
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,208
Hasn't been moody or depressed.

315
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,124
I wondered
if you'd noticed anything

316
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,401
when you saw him this morning.

317
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,562
Nothing at all.

318
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,809
He was, what shall I say,
normality itself.

319
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,567
When did it occur, this tragedy?

320
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,330
Can't say exactly.

321
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,681
Nobody seems to have heard
the shot.

322
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,601
It was discovered about 1:30
by the pageboy, Alfred Biggs.

323
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,285
At what time
did Monsieur Morley

324
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,323
last press the buzzer
for a new patient?

325
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,523
5 past 12:00,
and the boy showed up

326
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,043
the patient who was waiting,
a Mr. Amberiotis,

327
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,969
staying at the Astoria Hotel,

328
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,525
according to
the appointment book.

329
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,531
And at what time did he leave,
this Monsieur Amberiotis?

330
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,005
Well, the boy
didn't show him out,

331
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,281
so he doesn't know.

332
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,200
But I rang up the Astoria,
and Mr. Amberiotis says

333
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,527
he looked at his watch
as he closed the front door

334
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,008
and it was exactly
25 past 12:00.

335
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,967
So at 25 minutes past 12:00,

336
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,809
our dentist,
he is the normal dentist, eh--

337
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,809
cheerful, competent, urbane.

338
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,049
And the very next moment,
despair, misery, what you will,

339
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,844
and he shoots himself?

340
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,962
No.

341
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,208
It's quite incredible to me

342
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,721
that my brother
should have committed suicide.

343
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,162
He'd been quite
his usual self, had he, madam?

344
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,964
Not upset in any way?

345
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,162
He was annoyed.

346
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,123
He had a busy day
in front of him,

347
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,368
and his assistant
had received a telegram

348
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,522
to say her aunt had
had a stroke.

349
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,967
She left for Yorkshire
by an early train.

350
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,527
And your brother,
he was annoyed at this?

351
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,802
Well, the fact is...

352
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,684
His assistant's got engaged

353
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,127
to a rather unsuitable
young man,

354
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,561
and it occurred to Henry
that this young man

355
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,648
had persuaded her
to take the day off.

356
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,967
What does he do,
this young man?

357
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,404
Frank Carter is-- or was--
an insurance clerk.

358
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,087
He lost his job a few weeks ago
and seems unable to get another.

359
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,725
Did your brother try
and persuade her

360
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,126
to break off her engagement?

361
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,891
Oh, yes, he did,
as a matter of fact.

362
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,322
So this Frank Carter would
quite possibly have a grudge

363
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,566
against your brother.

364
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,011
[knocking at door]

365
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,451
It's that Miss Neville.

366
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,648
She's back in a rare taking,
she is.

367
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,524
The whole thing was
a wicked practical joke.

368
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,529
There wasn't anything wrong
with Auntie at all.

369
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,927
She couldn't understand it
when I suddenly turned up.

370
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,326
Are you quite sure

371
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,330
it wasn't your friend Mr. Carter
who sent this telegram?

372
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,046
Frank?
Whatever for?

373
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,050
Oh, I see what you mean.

374
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,321
A put-up job between us.

375
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,249
We wouldn't do
a thing like that.

376
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,089
Tell me, mademoiselle,

377
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,567
what patients had Mr. Morley
this morning?

378
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,769
They're all in here.

379
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,570
Um, at 10:00, Mrs. Soames
about her new plate.

380
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,524
10:30, Lady Gregson.
She's an elderly lady.

381
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,211
11:00, Mr. Hercule Poirot.

382
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,766
Oh, that's you, isn't it?

383
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,805
11:30, Mr. Alistair Blunt-
you know, the banker.

384
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,809
Then Miss Sainsbury Seale.

385
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,251
She's just back from India.

386
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,249
12:00, Mr. Amberiotis.

387
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,328
He was a new patient,

388
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,364
made his appointment
from the Astoria Hotel.

389
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,809
And 12:30, Mrs. Pinner.
She comes up from Worthing.

390
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
If you please, Alfred,
tell me,

391
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,567
is it possible
for anyone to enter the house

392
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,125
without you
having to let them in?

393
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,605
Nah.

394
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,960
No, not a chance.

395
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,208
Well, not unless they got a key,
anyway.

396
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,971
But it is quite easy for them
to leave the house.

397
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,162
Oh, yeah.

398
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,408
Yeah, most of them
come down the stairs

399
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,762
while I'm taking the new party
up in the lift, see.

400
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,326
Did you see Mr. Amberiotis
leave?

401
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,851
Nah.

402
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,724
No, he must have
let himself out.

403
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,604
But you are quite sure
that nobody else came

404
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,206
to the house this morning,
only the patients.

405
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,448
That Mrs. Neville's young man
came round.

406
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
In a bit of a paddy, he was,
not to find her here.

407
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,441
We haven't heard about this
before.

408
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,090
Well, when I told him

409
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,167
Miss Neville was out
for the day,

410
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,611
he got quite shirty,

411
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,291
said he'd wait
and see Mr. Morley.

412
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,245
Well, then he went
into the waiting room.

413
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,328
You must have seen him there,
sir.

414
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,329
Ah, yes.

415
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,171
The troubled young man
who would not sit down.

416
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,329
Yeah, must have got tired
of waiting, I suppose.

417
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,807
He wasn't there later.

418
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,883
Why, Chief Inspector Japp,
an officer of your eminence,

419
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,890
is he usually called in
to a case of apparent suicide?

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,331
Alistair Blunt was here.

421
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,808
Mr. Blunt is the kind of person
we take care of in this country.

422
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,445
You mean that there are
certain people

423
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,806
who would like him
out of the way?

424
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,967
You bet there are.

425
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,286
The Reds, to begin with.

426
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,204
And our Blackshirted friends.

427
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,845
This Blunt and his group
have a standing

428
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,450
behind the present government.

429
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,211
That is more or less
as I guessed.

430
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,729
Tell me something about
Monsieur Blunt, Chief Inspector.

431
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,285
Alistair Blunt?

432
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,926
He controls all
the Arnholt interests in Europe

433
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,122
as well as the merchant banks.

434
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,891
He married into the family.

435
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,321
We oughtn't spend too long
with him.

436
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,249
I want to get on to the Astoria.

437
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,886
As it stands at the moment,
this Mr. Amberiotis

438
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,647
was the last person
to see Mr. Morley alive.

439
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,127
This is the second occasion
this year

440
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,210
that my allowance has not been
paid on time, Alistair.

441
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,120
You must talk to the bank,
Julia, or to the trustees.

442
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,450
If only my poor dear sister
were still alive.

443
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,726
If she were alive, Mother,

444
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,410
you couldn't benefit
from her will.

445
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,608
That is a wicked thing to say,
Jane.

446
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,722
It's not wicked; it's true.

447
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,969
The truth is often wicked.

448
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,209
I'm sorry, Julie;
this is not my business.

449
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,163
When I die, the capital
will come to you,

450
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,964
to do with exactly as you wish.

451
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,605
Until then--

452
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,442
- Until then, I am expected
to exist-- I won't say "live"--

453
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,371
on the pittance from the trust.

454
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,845
$25,000 a year can scarcely
be called a pittance.

455
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,968
Do you think
Rebecca intended me

456
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,684
to live on your charity?

457
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,768
It is not charity.

458
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,201
[phone beeps]

459
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,924
Yes, Miss Montressor.

460
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,801
A Chief Inspector Japp and
a Mr. Poirot to see you, sir.

461
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,605
Really?
Would you show them in, please?

462
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,086
Chief Inspector Japp.

463
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,321
How do you do, sir?

464
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,568
This is Mr. Hercule Poirot.

465
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,081
I know your name, of course,
Monsieur Poirot,

466
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,044
but surely somewhere
quite recently-

467
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
This morning, Monsieur Blunt.

468
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,289
In the waiting room
of the dentist,

469
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,930
the pauvre Monsieur Morley.

470
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,327
Yes, of course.
I knew I'd seen you somewhere.

471
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,931
<i>"Pauvre"?</i>

472
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,964
Mr. Morley was found dead,
sir, shortly after you left,

473
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,003
an apparent suicide.

474
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,126
Morley?

475
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,810
Suicide?

476
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,684
What an extraordinary thing.

477
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,689
Uh...

478
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,801
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

479
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,809
This is my niece, Miss Olivera,

480
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,570
and her mother, Mrs. Olivera.

481
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,047
Mademoiselle, madame.

482
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,687
I've never heard of a dentist
committing suicide before.

483
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,366
Wouldn't happen in the States;
you can be sure of that.

484
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,364
They're too damn rich
to kill themselves.

485
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,842
He seemed in good health and
spirits this morning, Mr. Blunt?

486
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,650
Well, I think so, yes.

487
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,364
Have you seen him often?

488
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,409
This is
my third or fourth visit.

489
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,800
Monsieur Blunt, who was it

490
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,888
that recommended to you
Monsieur Morley originally?

491
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,004
Arnholt, one of my directors.
Lionel Arnholt.

492
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,810
We're just wondering,
you see, sir,

493
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,888
whether it wasn't suicide
but murder

494
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,367
and the real target
was yourself.

495
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,008
But that doesn't make
any sense at all.

496
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,009
Well, none of it does
at the moment, sir.

497
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,009
That's the problem.

498
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,330
[bell dings]

499
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,886
Good evening.

500
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,367
We'd like to see
Mr. Amberiotis.

501
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,161
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you can't.

502
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,647
Oh, yes, I can, my lad.

503
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,727
Police.

504
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,207
You don't understand, sir.

505
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,449
Mr. Amberiotis died
half an hour ago.

506
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,686
Girls: # One, two #

507
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,044
# Buckle my shoe #

508
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,563
# Three, four #

509
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,969
# Open the door #

510
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,404
# One, two #

511
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,606
# Buckle my shoe #

512
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,565
Interesting.

513
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,523
Interesting, Dr. Bennett?

514
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,725
Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure.

515
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,002
Heart failure?

516
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,170
Brought about by an overdose
of adrenaline and novocaine.

517
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,566
How large an overdose?

518
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,966
Oh, I can't say yet.

519
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,407
These quantitative analyses
take time.

520
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,925
I'll be able to tell you
tomorrow.

521
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,162
Novocaine's the stuff
dentists give you, isn't it?

522
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,611
That's right, Chief Inspector.

523
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,281
The subject had been
to the dentist, I believe.

524
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,325
What a washout.

525
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,851
What do you mean,
Chief Inspector?

526
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,645
Morley makes a mistake
and injects an overdose.

527
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,604
Then when Amberiotis is gone,
he realizes what he's done,

528
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,609
can't face the music,
and shoots himself.

529
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,882
With a pistol
he is not known to possess?

530
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,684
Relations don't know
everything.

531
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,370
No, that is true, of course.

532
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,245
Well, there we are, then.

533
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,160
All the same, Chief Inspector,
it does not quite satisfy me.

534
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,964
Ah, cheer up, Poirot.

535
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,323
We can't have
a nice juicy murder every time.

536
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,922
Committed suicide?
Mr. Morley?

537
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,725
Poor man.

538
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,009
I suppose he had something
on his mind.

539
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,600
Such worrying times we live in.

540
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,803
Did he seem worried to you,
Miss Sainsbury Seale?

541
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,569
Well, I-- I can't really say,
you know, that he did.

542
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,160
Can you tell us who else
was in the waiting room

543
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,406
while you were there?

544
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,562
Let me see.

545
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,524
There was just one young man
there when I went in.

546
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,846
I think he was in pain,

547
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,610
because he was muttering
to himself

548
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,404
and looking quite wild.

549
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,325
And then suddenly he jumped up
and went out.

550
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,966
And he was the only other
patient that you noticed?

551
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,210
A gentleman came
down the stairs and went out

552
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,926
just as I went up to Mr. Morley.

553
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,044
Oh, and I remember
a very peculiar foreigner

554
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,004
came out of the house
just as I arrived.

555
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,610
[clears throat]

556
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,802
That was I, madame.

557
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,050
Oh.

558
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,162
Oh, dear.

559
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,725
Oh, do forgive me.

560
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,285
Oh.
Oh.

561
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,129
The light in here is so dim.

562
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,322
Please calm yourself, madame.

563
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,920
Well, I think
that's about all,

564
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,451
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

565
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,965
We may require you
to give evidence

566
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,525
at the inquest, of course.

567
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,971
Oh, no!

568
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,809
I would be so nervous.

569
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,281
Well, no need to be nervous,
madam.

570
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,687
Just stand up and speak clearly.

571
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,881
Oh!

572
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,008
That's very amusing,
Chief Inspector.

573
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,571
Is it?

574
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,569
I used to be an actress.

575
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,762
Just small parts, you know.

576
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,201
Then I went on a world tour-

577
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,926
Yes, well...

578
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,884
Well, if my name should be
in the papers-

579
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,048
as a witness at the inquest,
I mean-

580
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,050
you will be sure that it's
spelled right, won't you?

581
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,687
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.

582
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,010
Mabelle spelled M-a-b-e-l-l-e.

583
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,043
[giggles]

584
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,681
Blimey.

585
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,849
I can only give you
a few moments,

586
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,247
I'm afraid, Mr. Poirot.

587
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,886
I'm going to see Traviata
at Covent Garden.

588
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,288
Ah.
Thank you, Monsieur Arnholt.

589
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,282
What's this all about?

590
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,564
It is about the death of the
dentist Monsieur Henry Morley.

591
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,011
It was you, was it not,

592
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,685
who recommended him
to Monsieur Blunt?

593
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,883
Yes, I've been going to him
for years.

594
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,809
You don't think I killed him,
do you?

595
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,570
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

596
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,682
<i>Quelle idée.
No.</i>

597
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,564
It is just that I'm given
to wonder

598
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,968
whether Monsieur Blunt was not
perhaps the intended victim.

599
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,447
I don't quite see
how that works.

600
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,647
No.

601
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,445
At this moment,
Monsieur Arnholt, neither do I.

602
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,841
One grips at the straws.

603
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,884
But tell me, Madame Olivera,

604
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,764
the sister-in-law
to Monsieur Blunt,

605
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,884
she <i>is une dame formidable,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

606
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,729
Oh, indeed.

607
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,205
How did Madame Olivera take

608
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,891
to Monsieur Blunt marrying
her sister?

609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,729
I mean, after all,

610
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,604
he was a mere employee
of the family business.

611
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,125
I don't know about "mere".

612
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,881
Alistair was head of our
overseas investments department.

613
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,967
Ah.

614
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,845
But I don't think Aunt Julia
looked at it like that anyway.

615
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,806
They were so obviously
crazy about each other.

616
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,611
Nobody, of course, knew,
but she was already suffering

617
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,246
from the disease that killed her
four years later.

618
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,806
A tragedy.

619
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,843
Yes.

620
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,769
Pardon.

621
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,522
I must detain you no longer
from your Monsieur Verdi.

622
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,042
Monsieur Arnholt, I thank you
very much for your patience,

623
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,004
and I hope that you enjoy
the opera.

624
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,248
Thank you.

625
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,404
[intensifying dramatic music]

626
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,884
<i>[music]</i>

627
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,044
I formed the opinion

628
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,004
that Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure

629
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,849
caused by a large overdose

630
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,210
of a novocaine and adrenaline
mixture.

631
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,802
The dentist who treated
Mr. Amberiotis earlier

632
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,410
on the day of his death

633
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,404
is now himself dead,
I understand.

634
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,244
So I understand, sir.

635
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,648
Thank you, Dr. Bennett.

636
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,967
Thank you.

637
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,687
Well, there doesn't seem
much doubt, gentlemen,

638
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,121
that this is a case
of accidental death,

639
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,447
a very unfortunate case.

640
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,367
Did Mr. Morley
accidentally give his patient

641
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,360
too large a dose
of the anesthetic?

642
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,169
Or did Mr. Amberiotis have
an unusual reaction to it?

643
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,763
Since Mr. Morley
is now himself dead,

644
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,204
we shall never have the answer
to this.

645
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,211
Nevertheless, it is your duty,
of course,

646
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,166
gentlemen of the jury,
to consider all possibilities

647
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,011
before you arrive
at your verdict.

648
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,090
But I must remind you
that before...

649
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,690
Nobody's seen hide nor hair
of Miss Sainsbury Seale

650
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,404
since Tuesday.

651
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,690
Such a nice type of woman,
and she seemed so happy here.

652
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,609
I wouldn't have bothered you
with this, sir,

653
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,882
but I remember she'd been
a witness in that other case.

654
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,411
No, quite right, Beddoes.

655
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,689
Why should she disappear?

656
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,203
It is curious, you admit?

657
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,005
There was nothing funny
about her, you know?

658
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,804
A cable to Calcutta.

659
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,161
Got the reply back last night.

660
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,205
She went out there as an actress
and then took to good works.

661
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,642
Got hand in glove with
the missionaries, apparently.

662
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,882
What I call a terrible woman

663
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,562
but definitely not the type
to get mixed up in a murder.

664
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
You got anything?

665
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,566
Stockings.

666
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,889
Ten-inch, cheap silk.

667
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,409
Price: probably 2 shillings
and 11 pence.

668
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,404
You're not valuing
for probate, Poirot.

669
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,167
Mr. Poirot.

670
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,970
Mademoiselle Neville.

671
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,003
What a pleasant surprise.

672
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,929
I'm so sorry to worry you
like this,

673
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,724
but I had to see you.

674
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,162
I was very upset by the inquest
this morning.

675
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,851
It couldn't happen
the way they said it did--

676
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,770
giving a patient an overdose,
I mean.

677
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,291
The dentists get into the habit

678
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,926
of giving the regulation amount
automatically.

679
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,247
But you did not say this
in the coroner's court.

680
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,807
I was afraid
of making things worse.

681
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,888
People might think
he did it deliberately.

682
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,287
I see.

683
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,721
Shall we discuss this further?

684
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,962
Come.

685
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,521
I should like to know
a little bit more

686
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,167
about the telegram you received
calling you away on that day.

687
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,284
Do you yourself have any ideas
on the subject?

688
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,368
Not really.

689
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,882
Frank, my friend,

690
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,890
accused me of wanting to go off
for the day with somebody else.

691
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,604
Oh!

692
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,451
He's been very moody
and suspicious lately.

693
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,931
Just losing his job

694
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,929
and not being able
to get another one, I suppose.

695
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,724
And he was upset, was he not,
to discover

696
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,080
that you had gone away
on that day?

697
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,167
Yes.

698
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,611
You see, he'd come round
to tell me

699
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,290
how he'd got
this marvelous new job,

700
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,731
£10 a week.

701
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,887
Oh.

702
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,129
He wanted me to know
right away.

703
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,969
And what is it,
this new job?

704
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,801
Oh, well, I don't know
all the details.

705
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,002
Some government department.

706
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,441
I have to write
to his London address,

707
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,806
and the letters get forwarded.

708
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,081
Oh, la.

709
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,204
Does that not seem to you
to be a little strange?

710
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,765
Well, I thought so,

711
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,208
but Frank says
it's often done nowadays.

712
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,566
I should like to meet this
friend of yours, mademoiselle.

713
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,284
His only free day is Sunday.

714
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,243
He's away in the country
all week.

715
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,409
<i>Eh bien,</i>tomorrow is Sunday.

<i>[music]</i>

718
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,444
I'm fed up with 'earing
about Marley's death,

719
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,931
to be quite honest.

720
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,963
There wasn't anything
so wonderful about him

721
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,889
that I could see.

722
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,809
Tell me, Monsieur Carter,

723
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,208
why were you in Harley Street
that day?

724
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,125
I saw you there
in the waiting room.

725
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,648
All right.

726
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,000
I was gonna tell Morley

727
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,202
that this business
of putting Gladys against me

728
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,971
had gone on long enough,
that I'd landed a good job,

729
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,082
and that it was about time
she handed in her notice

730
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,565
a thought about a trousseau.

731
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,286
But you did not actually
tell him these things?

732
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,290
I got fed up with waiting
in that dingy mausoleum,

733
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,686
so I left.

734
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,404
At what time did you leave?

735
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,324
I can't remember.

736
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,407
I've got to get going;
the march will be starting soon.

737
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,928
It has been a great pleasure
to meet you, Monsieur Carter.

738
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,801
And, yes, I am delighted
to hear about your new job.

739
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,367
The work, it is interesting,
n'est-ce pas?

740
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,284
Oh, yeah.

741
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,129
You know.

742
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,045
I'll see you next week, Gladys.

743
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,082
Bye, Frank.

744
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,044
<i>Au revoir, Monsieur Carter.</i>

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,927
Are you receiving visitors,
mon ami?

Good heavens.
Poirot.

747
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,887
Chief Inspector.

748
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,445
What on Earth brings you
to Isleworth

749
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,647
on a Sunday afternoon?

750
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,250
Business.
What else?

751
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,647
Well, you better come inside
and have a cup of tea.

752
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,922
Thank you.

753
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,241
[whistling]

754
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,961
Madame Japp,
she is not at home?

755
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,360
No, no.

756
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,443
Some blessed meeting.

757
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,809
Women's institute,
parish counsel, or something.

758
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,127
I don't know.

759
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,965
Do you take sugar, Poirot?

760
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,889
Do you have perhaps a tisane?

761
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,161
Come off it, Poirot.

762
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,688
This is Isleworth, you know,
not Juan-les-Pins.

763
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,847
What's the business, anyway?

764
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,406
I wondered if you'd been able
to trace the telegram

765
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,001
that was sent
to Mademoiselle Gladys Neville.

766
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,122
Yes, we did,
as a matter of fact.

767
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,005
Rather clever.

768
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,044
The aunt lives in Richmond
in Yorkshire.

769
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,731
The telegram was handed in
in Richmond, Surrey,

770
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,729
just down the road here.

771
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,683
Do you know what I think,
Chief Inspector?

772
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,410
What's that?

773
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,880
I think that there are signs
of brains in this business.

774
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,731
Well, the assistant
commissioner is satisfied

775
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,126
that Morley killed himself.

776
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,527
Is he satisfied
with the disappearing lady?

777
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,645
Ah, the case
of the disappearing Seale.

778
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,171
No.

779
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,601
I'm still working on that.

780
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,008
She's got to be somewhere.

781
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,084
Mm.
Garibaldi?

782
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,966
And I really think my feelings
ought to be considered

783
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,445
in the matter, Alistair.

784
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,568
But your feelings
have been considered, Mother.

785
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,011
Yes, Julia, that is true.

786
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,282
[knocking at door]

787
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,249
Mr. Poirot to see you,
Mr. Blunt.

788
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,725
Thank you, Helen.

789
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,763
Monsieur Poirot,
it's very good of you to come.

790
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,847
Monsieur Blunt.

791
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,440
Well!

792
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,927
If you are going
to talk horrors,

793
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,281
I shall leave.

794
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,246
Allow me.

795
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,966
I'll see you at home, Jane.

796
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,924
Madame.

797
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,089
You've met Miss Olivera,
I think.

798
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,884
Oh, yes, indeed.
Mademoiselle.

799
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,650
- Please.
- Thank you.

800
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,364
I hope
I haven't asked you here

801
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,807
on a wild goose chase,
Mr. Poirot.

802
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,725
It's about this missing woman
that the papers are full of,

803
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,171
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

804
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,044
- Yes.
- Jane?

805
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,606
I'm sure
this is utterly unimportant.

806
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,882
And why we are wasting
Mr. Poirot's time,

807
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,967
I really don't know.

808
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,090
If you please, Mr. Blunt,
allow Poirot to decide.

809
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,925
Well, Sainsbury Seale
is such a pompous name.

810
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,644
That's why I remembered.

811
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,761
It was the last time

812
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,644
Uncle Alistair went
to the dentist.

813
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,966
Well, I don't mean
the other day;

814
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,570
I mean about a week ago.

815
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,729
I was with him,
and we stopped in Harley Street,

816
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,241
and just as he got out,
a woman came out of the dentist,

817
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,051
a middle-aged woman
with fussy hair

818
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,401
and rather dowdy clothes.

819
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,685
"Oh, Mr. Blunt, you don't
remember me, I'm sure".

820
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,086
People are always saying that,

821
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,611
and I never do.

822
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,802
"I was a great friend
of your wife's, you know".

823
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,604
They usually say that too.

824
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,444
It always ends the same way:

825
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,728
a subscription
to some charity or other.

826
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,286
£5 to a zenana mission
this time.

827
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,926
And had she really known
your wife, Monsieur Blunt?

828
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,929
Well...

829
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,405
the mention
of the zenana mission

830
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,210
made me think she may have done.

831
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,448
We were in India
about four years ago,

832
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,045
just before my wife's death.

833
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,288
Perhaps we met once
at a reception.

834
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,811
I think it's queer

835
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,571
the way she tried to scrape
an acquaintance with you.

836
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,527
And she did not try to, um,
how do you say,

837
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,971
follow it up in any way?

838
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,246
Why, no.

839
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,805
I'd forgotten her name, even,

840
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,367
until Jane spotted it
in the paper.

841
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,330
Well, I just thought
you ought to be told,

842
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,568
Monsieur Poirot.

843
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,008
Here.

844
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,645
Here, Alison?

845
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,125
What?

846
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,210
There's a thing here
about a woman who came here,

847
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,721
Miss Sainsbury Seale.

848
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,731
It says here she's missing.

849
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,965
You don't have a passkey?

850
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,162
No, I've never had one.

851
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,930
We can't just break in.

852
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,929
Well, suppose
something's happened to her.

853
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,042
Yes, and suppose
she's gone off on holidays.

854
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,731
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

855
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,929
Go on, Sergeant.

856
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,842
Right.

857
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,447
Mrs. Chapman!

858
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,568
Leave it to us.

859
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,768
Mrs. Chapman!

860
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,647
Sergeant.

861
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,248
Hello?

862
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,166
Anybody there?

863
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,807
Mrs. Chapman?

864
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,167
Hello?

865
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,766
Anybody here?

866
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,931
This is the boxroom.

867
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,771
What's that?

868
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,723
Well, I don't know.

869
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,609
[sniffing]

870
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,291
Shall I open it, Sarge?

871
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,004
Go on, then.

872
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,361
It's not particularly pleasant.

873
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,649
[retching]

874
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,887
That's the porter
being sick, sir.

875
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,321
I had to get him to have
another look at the body

876
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,568
to identify it.

877
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,802
There's some brandy
in the other room.

878
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,607
It was not pretty, that.

879
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,731
Tell me all about it,
Chief Inspector.

880
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,084
The flat belongs
to a Mrs. Albert Chapman.

881
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,202
Can't tell you much about her,
really.

882
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,765
Pays her bills.

883
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,609
Fond of a game of bridge.

884
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,927
Keeps herself to herself
more or less.

885
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,288
The neighbors say they've hardly
ever seen her, in fact.

886
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,085
Mr. Chapman's a commercial
traveler, apparently,

887
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,761
so he spends most of his time
away from home.

888
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,247
And Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale?

889
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,688
She came here on the evening
of our interview with her,

890
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,882
about 7:15.

891
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,923
The porter's wife
was cleaning up here

892
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,280
and saw her arrive.

893
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,530
She'd been here once before,
the porter says.

894
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,205
Now, one thing's for certain:

895
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,403
Sylvia Chapman
or Sylvia's friends

896
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,131
murdered the lady, put her
in the box, and made off.

897
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,766
But why was the face
so battered?

898
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,689
Sheer vindictiveness, maybe.

899
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,251
Or it may have been
with the idea

900
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,124
of concealing
the woman's identity.

901
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,844
I don't know.

902
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,123
No fingerprints anywhere,
as far as we can see.

903
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,561
You mean every fingerprint
in the apartment

904
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,284
was removed after the murder?

905
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,368
That's about the size of it.

906
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,571
Something worrying you, Poirot?

907
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,609
[sighs]

908
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,330
Yes.

909
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,367
Yes, I'm very seriously worried.

910
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,804
There is here, you see,
an insoluble problem.

911
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,408
One patent leather shoe,
complete with buckle.

912
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,527
What's wrong with that?

913
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,802
Nothing.

914
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,446
Absolutely nothing.

915
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,922
All the same,
I do not understand.

916
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,126
Some bearers
belonging to Madame Chapman.

917
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,125
Ah.

918
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,445
Some old theater programs.

919
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,722
A leaflet
about the zenana missions.

920
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,326
We can guess
who brought that here.

921
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,050
Nothing much of interest
in the address book either, sir.

922
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,925
No, so I see.

923
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,730
Hairdressers.

924
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,730
Dressmakers.

925
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,126
A dentist.

926
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,608
Morley, 168 Harley Street.

927
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,085
Not so strange

928
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,766
if she was a friend
of the Sainsbury Seale woman.

929
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,245
Pardon.

930
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,045
Mr. Poirot?

931
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,924
What brings you here?

932
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,281
Tell me, if you please,

933
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,961
did your brother ever mention
to you in particular

934
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,209
a Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
or a Madame Chapman?

935
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,084
No.

936
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,009
No, I don't think so.

937
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,167
I managed to make this

938
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,964
before they took everything,
Miss Morley.

939
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,320
Oh, thank you, Agnes.

940
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,522
Would you like a cup, sir?

941
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,281
Not for me, Agnes.
Thank you very much.

942
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,085
Agnes is coming with me
to the country.

943
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,168
She's becoming
quite a good little cook,

944
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,045
so she'll be able
to do everything for me.

945
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,210
- Excuse me, sir...
- Yes.

946
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,761
- For asking.
- Yes.

947
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,211
But does anyone know
anything more

948
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,004
about the master's death, sir?

949
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,600
Nothing fresh
has come to light, Agnes.

950
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,324
They're still quite sure
he shot himself

951
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,363
because he'd made a mistake
with that drug.

952
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,602
Yes.

953
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,687
Why do you ask?

954
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,689
- I only--
- Agnes?

955
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,928
I just want to be sure, sir.

956
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,407
Agnes!

957
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,808
- Ah, Chief Inspector.
- No time, Poirot.

958
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,331
We found
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Chapman.

959
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,680
Where?

960
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,802
They booked into the
Montague Hotel this morning.

961
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,251
The Montague Hotel,
Bloomsbury?

962
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,327
That's right.

963
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,805
It is odd, is it not,

964
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,526
being on the run after murdering
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,

965
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,244
that they have not run further?

966
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,131
You never can tell
with the criminal mind, Poirot.

967
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,527
Open up!

968
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,641
Who is it?

969
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,410
Police.

970
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,840
Police?

971
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,043
Just open the door,
Mr. Chapman.

972
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,447
[lock clicking]

973
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,965
Here!

974
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,208
All right, there's no need
for anyone to get hurt.

975
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,926
You are Mr. Albert Chapman?

976
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,087
Yes.

977
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,170
And this is Mrs. Chapman?

978
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,089
Yes.

979
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,406
What's the meaning of this?

980
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,130
I'll ask the questions, sir.

981
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,083
Do you live
at number 45 Lichfield Court

982
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,326
in Battersea in the-

983
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,680
No.

984
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,131
What do you mean, "no"?

985
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,605
Well, we don't.

986
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,450
Do we, Beryl?

987
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,806
Beryl?

988
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,207
What's wrong with "Beryl"?

989
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,688
We happen to know that your name
is Sylvia, Mrs. Chapman.

990
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,404
What are you talking about?

991
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,562
We live in Budleigh Salterton,

992
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,729
not this... Lichfield place.

993
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,808
You have proof of that,
I suppose.

994
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,410
Well, no, I haven't--

995
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,688
Yes, I have.

996
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,167
Watch him, Beddoes.

997
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,202
What's this?

998
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,846
Our wedding lines,
if you must know.

999
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,284
We were married this morning.

1000
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,088
I swear by almighty God

1001
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,168
that the evidence I shall give

1002
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,681
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

1003
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,161
and nothing but the truth.

1004
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,284
You are Mr. John Leatheran?

1005
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,367
Yes, sir.

1006
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,090
And you are a dentist.

1007
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,725
Yes, sir.

1008
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,251
I've taken over
the dental practice

1009
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,091
of the late Mr. Henry Morley
at 168 Harley Street.

1010
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,362
I see.

1011
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,124
You were recently called

1012
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,322
to examine the body
of the deceased

1013
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,727
for purposes of identification.

1014
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,287
Were you not?

1015
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,004
I was, sir.

1016
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,360
The police believed the body

1017
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,841
to be that of
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale,

1018
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,325
who was a patient
of Mr. Marley's.

1019
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,965
I see.

1020
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,563
You've inherited, as it were,
the late Mr. Marley's patients.

1021
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,727
That's right, sir.

1022
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,330
And, of course,
their dental records.

1023
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,681
Quite.

1024
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,361
And could you identify
the body from these records?

1025
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,800
I could, sir.

1026
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,048
It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.

1027
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,449
It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr. Marley's.

1028
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,604
[dramatic music]

1029
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:28,089
<i>[music]</i>

1030
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,122
The fair Mabelle
put one over on us

1031
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,526
good and proper.

1032
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,961
I wouldn't have thought
she was capable of murder,

1033
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,525
but that's what it looks like
now.

1034
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,531
Sylvia didn't murder Mabelle;
Mabelle murdered Sylvia.

1035
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,244
Perhaps.

1036
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,330
It crossed my mind that Morley
might have been killed

1037
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,329
so he couldn't identify
the body.

1038
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,283
But, as you have just heard,
Chief Inspector,

1039
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,970
the records
would still have existed.

1040
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,003
That's right.

1041
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,168
Anyway, I'm going back to work.

1042
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,685
Oh, Chief Inspector.

1043
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,770
This morning, I received
a letter from Monsieur Blunt.

1044
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,042
He has invited me to his house
in the country.

1045
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,128
He may have a commission for me.

1046
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,130
Well, you always did move
in exalted circles, Poirot.

1047
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,640
Helen isn't dining with us
tonight?

1048
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,647
I suggested that it would be
far better for her to rest

1049
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,246
than to go to all the bother
of dressing herself up

1050
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,646
and coming down.

1051
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,730
She saw my point.

1052
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,291
Oh?

1053
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,402
I thought it might make
a pleasant change for her.

1054
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,360
I really don't see why
you need a secretary

1055
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,682
during the weekend anyway.

1056
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,960
She's new to the job.

1057
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,566
There's a lot
she needs to learn.

1058
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,364
Monsieur Poirot?

1059
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,605
There is a great deal
about which

1060
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,122
I am not entirely satisfied.

1061
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,086
What do you want of me,
Monsieur Blunt?

1062
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,647
I want you to find this woman
Sainsbury Seale.

1063
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,047
Alive or dead?

1064
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,204
You think she may be dead.

1065
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,289
I think...

1066
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,368
She might be dead, yes.

1067
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,807
Why do you think so?

1068
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,284
Because of a pair of new
silk stockings I discovered.

1069
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,450
[laughs]

1070
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,568
You're an odd man,
Monsieur Poirot.

1071
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,091
Oh, yes, I am.

1072
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,407
Very odd.

1073
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:01,044
That is to say, I am methodical,
orderly, and logical,

1074
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,726
and I do not like
to distort facts

1075
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,922
to support a theory.

1076
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,843
Good morning.

1077
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,731
Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.

1078
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,966
Did you sleep well?

1079
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,526
Excellently.
Thank you, Monsieur Blunt.

1080
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,846
Good morning, mademoiselle.

1081
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,008
Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

1082
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,124
I would prefer not to accept
any invitations, Mr. Blunt,

1083
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,244
while your American relations
are with you.

1084
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,409
Good morning.

1085
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,403
Julia.

1086
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,403
I'm afraid you rather hurt
Helen's feelings.

1087
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,722
Oh, for heaven's sake,
Alistair.

1088
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,451
She's only a secretary.

1089
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,850
I notice
that you have a gardener

1090
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,128
who you must have employed
recently.

1091
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,644
Yes, we took one on
a couple of weeks ago.

1092
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,366
Do you know
from where he came?

1093
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,170
I'm afraid not.

1094
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,408
MacAlister, the head gardener,
engaged him.

1095
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,688
Oh.
What is his name?

1096
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,926
Well, I don't know.

1097
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,930
Dunning, Sunbury,
something of the sort.

1098
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,811
Seems like lots of people

1099
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,604
are out for your blood,
Uncle Alistair.

1100
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,122
Oh, really?
What are you reading?

1101
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,924
Oh, the debate in the House.

1102
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,530
That's only Archerton.

1103
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,051
If we'd let him have his way,

1104
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,003
England would be bankrupt
within a week.

1105
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,646
Did you know there are
over 2 million unemployed

1106
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,171
in this country?

1107
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,682
One can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs, Jane.

1108
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,565
I think we do pretty well,
all things considered.

1109
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,041
Industrial production
was up 3% last year.

1110
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,926
Take no notice
of what Jane says.

1111
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,042
You know what girls are.

1112
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,084
They go to these parties
in studios,

1113
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,726
and then they come home
and talk a lot of nonsense.

1114
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,285
Mother.

1115
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,404
I'm afraid I'm one of the last
of the old guard,

1116
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,800
Monsieur Poirot.

1117
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,130
And if the old guard
should be removed,

1118
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,446
what would happen?

1119
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,648
Removed?

1120
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,285
I'll tell you.

1121
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,526
A lot of damn fools

1122
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,688
would try a lot
of very costly experiments.

1123
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,848
It would be the end
of stability,

1124
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,689
of common sense,
and of solvency.

1125
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,124
Ah.

1126
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,563
Of course, we've always taken
great pride

1127
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,409
in our herbaceous borders here.

1128
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,840
They're a lot of work, mind,

1129
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,803
but well worth the effort,
I've always thought.

1130
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,922
Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.

1131
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,327
Yes, they're particularly good
this year.

1132
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,521
And look at these here.

1133
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,841
[gunshot]

1134
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,962
Good god!

1135
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,047
[dramatic music]

1136
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,082
Drop that gun!

1137
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,201
It wasn't me, I tell you.

1138
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,402
Oh, no? Just shooting
at the birds, I suppose.

1139
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,324
Oh, Mr. Blunt!

1140
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,647
I caught him right at it.

1141
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,001
I was just weeding the beds.

1142
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,043
I heard a shot,
the gun fell right at my feet,

1143
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,527
I picked it up, and this
stupid cowjumped on me.

1144
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,244
Now, then, Dunning, Dunbury--

1145
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,327
what is your name?

1146
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,408
His name is Frank Carter.

1147
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,085
You.

1148
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,690
You've had it in for me
all along.

1149
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,564
I never fired that shot!

1150
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,603
In that case, who did?

1151
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,929
As you can see,
there is no one else here

1152
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,611
but ourselves.

1153
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,047
You really must not agitate
yourself, Mademoiselle Neville.

1154
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,810
First they tried to pretend

1155
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,810
that Frank attempted
to murder Mr. Blunt,

1156
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,323
and now they've accused him
of murdering poor Mr. Morley.

1157
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,646
Sugar?

1158
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,081
No, thank you.

1159
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,329
I was down there, you know,
at Exsham,

1160
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,363
when the shot was fired
at Monsieur Blunt.

1161
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,000
It's these Blackshirts.

1162
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,441
They march around
waving their banners.

1163
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,409
They have
this ridiculous salute.

1164
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,121
And they work up these poor men
like Frank until they think

1165
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,846
they're doing something
wonderful and patriotic.

1166
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,088
And that is the defense
of Monsieur Carter?

1167
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,004
No! I haven't seen him,
of course.

1168
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,042
They wouldn't let me.

1169
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,447
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

1170
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,684
He has a solicitor
working for him,

1171
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,121
and he told me
what Frank had said.

1172
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,609
He met a man in a public house

1173
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,405
who said
he was in the secret service,

1174
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,327
and he offered Frank
this wonderful job.

1175
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,967
He was to take up the post
of gardener

1176
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,801
and listen to all the other
gardeners' conversations

1177
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,050
and sound them out
as to their Red tendencies.

1178
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,561
He had to pretend to be
a bit of a Red himself.

1179
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,446
And this solicitor,
he is of the opinion

1180
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,840
that his client would do better

1181
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,048
to think of a story
that is more plausible?

1182
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,209
Lawyers.

1183
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,642
You wouldn't believe
how difficult they are.

1184
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,882
Mademoiselle Neville.

1185
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,800
What did you think
of the housemaid, Agnes?

1186
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,288
I didn't think at all
about her.

1187
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,210
Mr. Marley's sister
kept a strict eye on the maids.

1188
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,691
Ah.

1189
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,928
Why are you asking?

1190
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,123
She wrote to me a letter,
and...

1191
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,847
As yet, I do not know why.

1192
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,961
Thank you.

1193
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,287
Your tea, madam.

1194
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,721
Thank you.

1195
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,730
I hope you didn't mind me
writing you that letter, sir,

1196
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,810
only I didn't want for you
to come to the house.

1197
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,561
I mean, if I was to say anything
in front of Miss Morley,

1198
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,365
she might say as how I ought
to have said something before.

1199
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,729
Me and the cook,
we'd read in the papers

1200
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,002
how the master had made
a mistake with that drug

1201
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,531
and had shot himself.

1202
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,927
So it did seem quite clear,
didn't it, sir?

1203
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,083
When did you begin
to feel differently, Agnes?

1204
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:21,091
Seeing in the paper, sir,
about that Frank Carter

1205
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,044
shooting at that gentleman.

1206
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,640
I mean, up till then,

1207
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,043
neither of us thought he'd done
anything to Mr. Morley.

1208
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,846
We just thought
it was a bit queer.

1209
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,962
What was queer, Agnes?

1210
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,042
It was that morning, sir.

1211
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,969
The morning
Mr. Morley shot himself.

1212
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,005
I was wondering if I dared
run down and get the post,

1213
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,610
so I went out on the landing,

1214
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,610
and I looked down
over the stairs.

1215
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,169
And it was then that I saw him,

1216
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,284
Frank Carter,
down on the stairs below.

1217
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,450
He was just standing there,
like, waiting.

1218
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,329
Then he seemed
to make up his mind,

1219
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,727
and he sort of went
very quickly down the stairs

1220
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,605
towards the masters surgery.

1221
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,169
And I thought to myself,
"The master won't like that".

1222
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,203
Agnes!

1223
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,322
But just then, Cook called me,

1224
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,284
and I went back
into the kitchen.

1225
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,727
And afterwards, I heard
the master had shot himself,

1226
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,049
and it was so awful, it just
drove everything out of my head.

1227
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,130
Tell me, Agnes.

1228
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,288
Did you actually see
Frank Carter

1229
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,926
enter the room
of Monsieur Morley?

1230
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,247
He must have done, sir.

1231
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,249
At what time was this?

1232
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,443
It must have been
about half past 12:00, sir.

1233
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,449
I want to see Frank Carter.

1234
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,728
What's the big idea?

1235
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,081
You are unwilling?

1236
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,041
What do you want
to see Carter for?

1237
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,043
Ask him
if he really murdered Morley?

1238
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,525
Yes.

1239
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,722
I suppose you think
he'll tell you if he did.

1240
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,365
He might tell me, yes.

1241
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,128
That can only mean that you've
got hold of something

1242
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,810
that proves
more or less conclusively

1243
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,001
that he didn't.

1244
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,566
You ought to play fair
with us, Poirot.

1245
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,810
I am playing fair with you,
Chief Inspector.

1246
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,445
Believe me.

1247
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,161
It's a damned lie!

1248
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,930
You paid her to say that.

1249
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,964
Anger and abuse will not
help you, Monsieur Carter.

1250
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,321
Agnes is going to tell
her story,

1251
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,761
and it is going to be believed.

1252
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,929
You were on the stairs,
Agnes did see you,

1253
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,686
and you did go into the room
of Monsieur Morley.

1254
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,928
What happened then?

1255
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,281
It's a lie!

1256
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,611
No.

1257
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,963
It is not a lie.

1258
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,851
If you did not kill
Monsieur Morley,

1259
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,646
your only hope is to tell me
the exact truth

1260
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,604
of what happened that morning.

1261
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,563
God curse you
if you let me down now.

1262
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,041
[chair scrapes]

1263
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,129
I did go in.

1264
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,726
I went up the stairs and waited
above Marley's landing

1265
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,287
till I could be sure
of getting him alone.

1266
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,643
Then a bearded gent came out
and went down the stairs.

1267
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,721
I was just making up my mind
to go

1268
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,083
when another gent came out
and went down the stairs too.

1269
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,890
I knew I had to be quick.

1270
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,606
I went along and nicked
into his room without knocking.

1271
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,291
I was all set
to have it out with him.

1272
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,602
But he was lying there dead,

1273
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,245
and I could see the bullet hole
in his head

1274
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,880
where a black crust
of blood ran.

1275
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,160
He was cold.

1276
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,526
I knew I was in a jam then.

1277
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,769
They were going to say
I'd done it.

1278
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,287
I hadn't touched anything

1279
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,006
except his hand
and the doorknob.

1280
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,451
I wiped that
with my handkerchief,

1281
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,080
both sides,
as I went out.

1282
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,362
There was nobody in the hall,
and I let myself out

1283
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,330
and licked it
as fast as I could.

1284
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,643
That's the truth.
He was dead already.

1285
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,967
You've got to believe me.

1286
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,362
By telling me the truth,

1287
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,320
you have just saved yourself
from being hanged.

1288
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,530
I don't see it.

1289
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,607
They're going to say-

1290
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,926
Monsieur Carter.

1291
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,044
Your story has confirmed
what I knew to be the truth.

1292
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,051
You can leave it now to me.

1293
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,931
[telephone rings]

1294
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,769
Japp.

1295
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,770
Ah, Poirot.

1296
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,405
Yes?

1297
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,123
Yes?

1298
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,927
What?

1299
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,644
No, Poirot, I--

1300
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,008
Well, I have to get clearance
on this, you know.

1301
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,243
Goon

1302
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,051
Yeah.

1303
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,969
All right,
I'll do what I can.

1304
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,562
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

1305
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,685
Girls: # One, two #

1306
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,885
# Buckle my shoe #

1307
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,082
[girls laughing]

1308
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,690
Mr. Hercule Poirot, sir.

1309
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,124
Thank you.

1310
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,322
This is about
Miss Sainsbury Seale, is it?

1311
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,601
Have you found her?

1312
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,609
I hope you do not object,
Monsieur Blunt,

1313
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,690
but I have invited a few
other people to join us.

1314
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,089
I'm not walking through
the streets in handcuffs.

1315
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,129
You'll walk
through the streets

1316
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,851
in anything I tell you, my lad.

1317
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,081
I hope this is a matter
of importance, Alistair.

1318
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,921
That Belgian detective sent
a most insolent message to us.

1319
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,327
Mother.

1320
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,249
[knocking at door]

1321
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,603
Miss Neville to see you, sir.

1322
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,842
Mademoiselle Neville.

1323
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,361
Are there many more,
Monsieur Poirot?

1324
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,763
If so, we may be more
comfortable in the boardroom.

1325
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,287
Is the boardroom free,
Miss Montressor?

1326
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,129
Yes, Mr. Blunt.

1327
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,808
Frank!

1328
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,525
All right, all right.

1329
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,563
You're still in His Majesty's
custody, you know.

1330
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,921
Show a bit of respect.
Come on.

1331
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,889
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>

1332
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,606
good afternoon.

1333
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,200
Since the beginning
of this case,

1334
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,805
three people have died:

1335
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,163
pauvre Monsieur Morley,
pauvre Monsieur Amberiotis,

1336
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,648
and pauvre
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1337
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,285
I thought she was
still missing.

1338
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,846
No, no, no, no, mademoiselle.

1339
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,440
In fact, Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale was dead

1340
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,122
even before the investigations
of this case began.

1341
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:23,121
The porter at Lichfield Court
told us

1342
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,924
that Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale

1343
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,884
had been to visit
Madame Chapman.

1344
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,447
He saw her go to the apartment
and be let in.

1345
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,524
She never came out again, no?

1346
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,405
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
was never, ever seen again

1347
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,291
until the police, they broke in
to the boxroom

1348
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,731
of Madame Chapman.

1349
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,888
You mean it was
Mabelle Sainsbury Seale's body

1350
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,610
in that flat after all?

1351
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,451
Indeed it was,
my dear Mademoiselle Neville.

1352
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,922
You see, it was a very clever
double bluff.

1353
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,206
The disfigured face was meant
to raise the question

1354
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,449
of the identity of the woman.

1355
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:03,447
But for me, the case,
it began with a shoe.

1356
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,963
As I left the dentist's
after my séance,

1357
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,766
a taxi stopped, a door opened,

1358
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,884
and a foot of a woman
prepared to descend.

1359
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,401
It was a foot
that was well shaped,

1360
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,969
with a good ankle
and an expensive stocking.

1361
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,084
The shoe was new, shining
patent leather

1362
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,363
with a large, ornate buckle.

1363
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,841
And when the rest of the lady
came into sight,

1364
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,329
to be frank,
it was quite a disappointment.

1365
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,206
As Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
descended from the taxi,

1366
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,086
she caught her shoe buckle,
and it was wrenched off.

1367
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,569
I picked it up
and returned it to her.

1368
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,011
Not at all, madame.

1369
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,885
- Ooh.
- Oh, dear.

1370
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,411
You are welcome, madame.

1371
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,449
Thank you so much.

1372
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,530
That was all.

1373
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,007
The incident, it was closed.

1374
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,770
[knocking at door]

1375
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,931
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Blunt,
to interrupt.

1376
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,405
I've finished the post.

1377
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,721
Is it all right if I leave now?

1378
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,921
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1379
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,963
Please, Mademoiselle Montressor.

1380
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,525
Please come and join the party.

1381
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,290
Monsieur Poirot is expounding

1382
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,363
some extremely entertaining
theories.

1383
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,005
Please.

1384
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,684
Go on, Poirot.

1385
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,888
Thank you.

1386
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,688
When Chief Inspector Japp
summoned me to Lichfield Court

1387
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,525
because a body
had been discovered,

1388
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,567
the first thing that I noticed
was a shabby buckled shoe.

1389
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,608
Well?

1390
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,722
Ah, you have failed
to appreciate the point,

1391
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,604
Monsieur Blunt.

1392
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,961
It was a shabby shoe.

1393
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,251
It was a well-worn shoe.

1394
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,409
But, you see,
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1395
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,928
visited the apartment
on the evening of the same day

1396
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,565
of the murder
of Monsieur Morley.

1397
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,330
So in the morning,
they were the new shoes.

1398
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,169
In the evening,
they were the old shoes?

1399
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,051
I can't see why
that's important.

1400
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,924
<i>Eh bien, mademoiselle.</i>

1401
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,726
Poirot does not like things
he cannot explain.

1402
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:32,442
Madame Chapman took a size five
in shoes.

1403
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,847
I knew that
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1404
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,246
wore a ten-inch stocking.

1405
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:41,127
That is to say, she took
at least a size six in shoes.

1406
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,006
So I went back
to reexamine the body.

1407
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,681
My idea was that the face
had been disfigured

1408
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,683
to hide the fact

1409
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,081
that it really was the body
of Madame Chapman

1410
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,249
dressed in the clothes of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1411
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:01,526
No, the shoe on the body
was size six,

1412
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,369
so it looked as if it was
the body

1413
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,649
of Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale after all.

1414
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,970
But then why was the face
so disfigured?

1415
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,647
By coincidence, the dentist
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1416
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,127
was also the dentist
of Madame Chapman:

1417
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,611
Monsieur Morley.

1418
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,007
But he was dead.

1419
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,681
However, the records, they
would have still existed, huh?

1420
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,689
So the successor
to Monsieur Morley

1421
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,848
would have been able
to positively identify the body

1422
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,769
as that of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1423
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,521
And could you identify
the body from these records?

1424
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,801
I could, sir.

1425
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,763
It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.

1426
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,441
It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr. Marley's.

1427
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,803
But if it was the body
of Madame Chapman,

1428
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,445
why was she dressed
in the clothes

1429
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,810
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale?

1430
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:54,049
An interesting problem,
n'est-ce pas?

1431
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,891
So I cast my mind back

1432
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,890
to the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale whom I had met,

1433
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,571
whom the Chief Inspector Japp
had met.

1434
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,170
I used to be an actress.

1435
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,884
Just small parts, you know.

1436
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,761
Then I went on a world tour,
and-

1437
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,325
- And although everything
about her

1438
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,680
and everything she said

1439
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,802
was in perfect accord
with her given character,

1440
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,447
I am now convinced that
the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1441
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,567
whom we have met

1442
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,205
and the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale

1443
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,970
who accosted you,
Monsieur Blunt...

1444
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,162
You don't remember me.
Mabelle.

1445
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,288
Gerda and I were on tour
together.

1446
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,767
They were not the same woman.

1447
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,201
You mean Miss Sainsbury Seale
was murdered

1448
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,647
and someone else took over
her identity?

1449
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,764
<i>Précisément.</i>

1450
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:42,807
Again, that is very dangerous,
n'est-ce pas?

1451
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,528
But the rewards,
they were very high.

1452
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,569
Rewards?

1453
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,085
What rewards?

1454
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,125
In just one moment,
if you please, Madame Olivera.

1455
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:58,164
Perhaps Mr. Morley
was murdered

1456
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,930
because he would have been able
to identify

1457
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,441
Miss Sainsbury Seale's body
by her teeth.

1458
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,285
Perhaps.

1459
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,084
However...

1460
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:14,244
Now we must face the facts.

1461
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,207
In the beginning, we believed
that the body of Monsieur Morley

1462
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,687
was first discovered
by the pageboy, Alfred,

1463
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,041
at about 1:30.

1464
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:29,889
But the fact is, I now know that
the body was first discovered

1465
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,891
by Monsieur Frank Carter
about one hour earlier,

1466
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,209
at about 12:30.

1467
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,651
Two things occurred

1468
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,286
between the death
of Monsieur Morley

1469
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,847
and the discovery of his body
by Monsieur Carter.

1470
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,770
The lady whose shoe buckle
I retrieved

1471
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,441
was shown into the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.

1472
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,127
While her accomplice
dragged the body

1473
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,004
into the office
of the secretary,

1474
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:13,010
the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1475
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,806
changes the labels on the files
of Monsieur Morley

1476
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,884
to ensure that the body
would be identified

1477
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,930
as that of Madame Chapman.

1478
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,367
She then leaves.

1479
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,568
Alfred shows in the next patient

1480
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,650
to the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.

1481
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,691
Now, Monsieur Amberiotis had
never before met the dentist,

1482
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,165
Monsieur Morley.

1483
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,847
It's been troubling me
since the journey from India.

1484
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:56,286
So our murderer, he was able
to assume his identity.

1485
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,841
This dentist tells
to Monsieur Amberiotis

1486
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,089
that it would be best
to freeze the gum.

1487
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,648
He then administers an injection

1488
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,850
which contains a dose
of novocaine and adrenaline

1489
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:18,045
which is sufficient to kill him
six hours later.

1490
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,401
[dramatic music]

1491
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,369
But why?

1492
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,602
Why would anyone want
to kill this man?

1493
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,961
Because Monsieur Amberiotis
had learned something

1494
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,606
from Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale.

1495
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,688
He had learned a secret...

1496
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,565
And a secret that could make him
a very rich man.

1497
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:50,166
I wish to speak
to Mr. Alistair Blunt.

1498
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:55,406
And Monsieur Amberiotis,
he was a blackmailer.

1499
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,325
Are you seriously suggesting
Amberiotis was blackmailing me?

1500
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,046
How could he blackmail
Alistair?

1501
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,003
Alistair has no secrets.

1502
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,329
With the greatest respect,
Madame Olivera,

1503
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,569
there I must disagree with you.

1504
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,321
Monsieur Blunt has
a very big secret,

1505
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,364
a secret that must be kept
at all costs.

1506
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,041
And there is only one method
that is totally effective

1507
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,767
in dealing with a blackmailer,
and that is to silence him...

1508
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,806
Forever.

1509
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,569
No, Monsieur Amberiotis,
he had to go.

1510
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,206
And Monsieur Blunt had seen
the name of Monsieur Amberiotis

1511
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,324
in the appointment book
belonging to Monsieur Morley.

1512
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,762
His blackmailer used
the same dentist.

1513
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,281
That'll do for today, I think.

1514
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,042
One more rinse, please.

1515
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,562
And so, Monsieur Blunt,
you devise a clever plan,

1516
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:01,368
a very clever plan indeed.

1517
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,205
You wait until your treatment
has been completed

1518
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,971
by Monsieur Morley.

1519
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,162
[water splashing]

1520
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,847
Then you shoot him.

1521
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:31,409
While the dental records
are being falsified,

1522
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:35,804
you drag the body into
the office of the secretary.

1523
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,805
[typewriter keys clattering]

1524
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,524
As I have said,
Monsieur Amberiotis

1525
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,881
had never before met
Monsieur Morley,

1526
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,050
so there was no reason
for him to suspect anything.

1527
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:12,767
You administer to him
the fatal injection.

1528
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,450
And when he has left, you drag
the body of Monsieur Morley

1529
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,290
back into the surgery...

1530
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,691
And arrange it
to look like suicide.

1531
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,125
I know, Monsieur Poirot,
you have a great reputation.

1532
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,006
But I'm afraid in this case,

1533
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,884
you are wrong
to a lunatic degree.

1534
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:56,609
Send him about his business,
Alistair.

1535
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:01,044
Mr. Blunt's family stands
foursquare behind him.

1536
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:05,444
I am very pleased to hear it,
Madame Olivera.

1537
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,568
But, you see,

1538
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,729
when Monsieur Blunt
married your sister,

1539
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,401
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt,

1540
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,528
he was not entirely honest
with her, no,

1541
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,563
nor with her family,

1542
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,650
because, as Monsieur Amberiotis
learned

1543
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,809
from the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,

1544
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,721
Monsieur Blunt
was already married.

1545
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,286
Look, there's no need
for the rest of you

1546
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,890
to listen to any more of this.

1547
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,604
If you-
No, no, no, Monsieur Blunt.

1548
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,410
You were dazzled
by the Arnholt family,

1549
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,769
by the vista not so much
of wealth but of power.

1550
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,884
And so dazzled were you that you
deliberately committed a bigamy

1551
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,526
and your real wife acquiesced
in the situation.

1552
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,971
Oh, what rot!

1553
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,004
What a fine portrait is this,
Monsieur Blunt!

1554
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:54,044
Such a portrait would be
to any boardroom an ornament!

1555
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:57,369
Monsieur Blunt standing beside
his beloved wife,

1556
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:02,128
the former
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt!

1557
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,450
<i>However, mesdames et messieurs,</i>

1558
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:12,130
I have here in my pocket

1559
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,965
a certificate of marriage

1560
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,323
between Martin Alistair Blunt

1561
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:19,851
and an actress by the name of

1562
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,169
Mademoiselle
Gerda Alexandra Grant

1563
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:28,730
dated April the 25th, 1925.

1564
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:35,330
And Mademoiselle Gerda Grant
is still very much alive.

1565
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,284
Yes.

1566
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,531
Indeed, she is
in this very room.

1567
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:02,801
And when I lived,
I was your other wife.

1568
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,686
And when you loved,
you were my other husband.

1569
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,961
[echoing]
Husband.

1570
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,531
Which is Beatrice?

1571
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:12,644
I answer to that name.

1572
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,762
What is your will?

1573
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,847
Do not you love me?

1574
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,248
Why, no,
no more than reason.

1575
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,761
Don't be so mamby-pamby,
Mabelle.

1576
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,611
You think he's not good enough
for me.

1577
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,451
Come on, Alistair.
I want to dance!

1578
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,763
[echoing]
Dance, dance, dance.

1579
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,561
Gerda got such a kick
out of it all.

1580
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,808
Didn't you, old girl?

1581
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,841
It was your skills
as an actress,

1582
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,042
Mademoiselle Montressor,

1583
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,084
that were the key
to the deception.

1584
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,249
You connived at the bigamy
of your husband.

1585
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,046
While he set about marrying
into the Arnholt family,

1586
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,642
you assumed the identity
of Madame Sylvia Chapman.

1587
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,684
After all these years!

1588
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,529
Hello, Mabelle.

1589
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,801
Come in.

1590
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,968
I've brought you some flowers.

1591
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,844
When the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale

1592
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,200
met again your husband,

1593
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,642
you murder your old friend
in cold blood.

1594
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,887
Go into the sitting room
straight through there.

1595
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,204
But your skills as an actress
are put to the test once again

1596
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,608
as the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.

1597
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,007
" Ooh!

1598
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,921
So kind.

1599
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,008
Not at all, madame.

1600
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,201
" Ooh!

1601
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,802
Unfortunately for you,
it was Hercule Poirot

1602
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:58,402
who retrieved your shoe buckle
that day.

1603
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,250
But having safely deceived

1604
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,203
the Chief Inspector Japp
and myself,

1605
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,005
or so you thought,

1606
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,441
you took the opportunity
to be as close as possible

1607
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,726
to your husband.

1608
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:15,004
You assumed the name
of Helen Montressor

1609
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,523
and joined him as
his new, efficient secretary.

1610
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,286
We'll never make these people
understand, will we, my darling?

1611
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:30,008
Such ordinary, unimaginative
people.

1612
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,084
I wish I could make you
understand, Monsieur Poirot,

1613
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,447
about my meeting with Rebecca
and my marriage.

1614
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,002
Gerda understood,
didn't you, old girl?

1615
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,088
We could have married again
after Rebecca's death,

1616
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:46,684
but, do you know, we'd come
to rather enjoy all the secrecy.

1617
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,529
She's an actress
through and through.

1618
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:49,971
She would have found it
very dull

1619
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,651
being just one character.

1620
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,762
Well...

1621
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,450
I've killed three people,

1622
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,005
so presumably I ought to hang.

1623
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,964
But haven't I done something
for England?

1624
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,082
I have held it firm.

1625
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,770
I have kept it solvent.

1626
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,362
I have kept it free
from dictators.

1627
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,284
I am necessary

1628
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,210
to the continuing peace
and well-being of this nation.

1629
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,322
Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

1630
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,090
What about me?

1631
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,009
He was gonna let me hang.

1632
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,885
<i>Précisément.</i>

1633
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,886
Monsieur Blunt,
with his usual efficiency,

1634
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,123
had provided for himself
a second line of defense.

1635
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,050
If things went wrong,
you, Monsieur Carter,

1636
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:37,240
you were to be
the scapegoat.

1637
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,842
You see, by now,
Monsieur Blunt knows

1638
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,531
of Monsieur Marley's opinion
regarding you,

1639
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,086
and so he arranges
for you to be engaged

1640
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,285
in a most mysterious fashion
as a gardener.

1641
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:52,966
Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.

1642
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,969
And how easy
for Helen Montressor

1643
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,562
to fire a shot
vaguely in your direction,

1644
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:01,206
drop the pistol at your feet,

1645
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,685
where you are bound
to pick it up?

1646
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,406
Help!

1647
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,800
Oh, Mr. Blunt!

1648
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,285
You are caught red-handed,

1649
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,971
and of course nobody is going
to believe your story,

1650
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,889
your ridiculous story

1651
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,004
about being employed
by the secret service.

1652
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,963
No.

1653
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,243
As far as Monsieur Blunt
is concerned,

1654
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,523
you can end your short life
on the gallows.

1655
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,962
I don't waste pity
on people like him.

1656
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,930
<i>Eh bien, Monsieur Blunt.</i>

1657
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,606
That is where you and I,
we do not see alike,

1658
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,361
for to me, the lives
of those three people

1659
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,524
are just as important
as your own life.

1660
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,680
Monsieur Blunt,

1661
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:51,407
you talk of the continued peace
of this nation, huh?

1662
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,881
Oh, yes, that is very good.

1663
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,800
But Poirot is not concerned
with nations.

1664
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,005
Poirot is concerned
with private individuals,

1665
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:07,047
who have the right not to have
taken from them their lives.

1666
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:14,447
Martin Alistair Blunt
and Gerda Alexandra Blunt,

1667
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,008
I arrest you
on charges of murder.

1668
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,204
Please.

1669
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:29,688
Girls: # One, two #

1670
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,327
# Buckle my shoe #

1671
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,250
[girls giggling]

1672
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:46,329
[tearfully]
Oh, my-- my poor dear sister.

1673
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,889
I don't know why I'm crying.

1674
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,082
Come on, Mother.

1675
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,926
I never liked him anyway.

1676
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:03,044
Why don't we go back home?

1677
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,164
To New York.

1678
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:17,649
That could have been me,
you know.

1679
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,047
I think I'm going to keep
a close eye on you in future,

1680
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,605
Frank Carter.

1681
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,286
You're not safe out on your own.

1682
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,643
Secret service.

1683
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,564
Look at it, Poirot,

1684
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,286
the trappings
of wealth and power.

1685
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,845
And yet underneath it all...

1686
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,286
Yes, Chief Inspector?

1687
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,164
Well, I mean,
it just shows you, doesn't it?

1688
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,965
They're no better than we are
when it comes down to it.

1689
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,326
It's the little chaps

1690
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,761
that keep things
on an even keel,

1691
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,166
chaps like you and me.

1692
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,611
Ah.

1693
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,850
But there are no little chaps,
Chief Inspector,

1694
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,567
particularly not Poirot.
