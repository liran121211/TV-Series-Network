1
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,958
The whole art
of clay-pigeon shooting

2
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,333
lies in the timing.

3
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,499
The trick is
when I say "pull" --

4
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:44,916
No!

5
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,541
Sorry.

6
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,291
My fault.
Should have warned you there.

7
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,374
Weren't you ready?

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,749
Oh, no, it's all right.

9
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,833
I say, they go out
jolly quickly, don't they?

10
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,041
Do you want a go?

11
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,041
No, I think I'll learn
the shooting bit first.

12
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,874
Can you reload that, Pamela?

13
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,874
Oh, I don't know.

14
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,499
They go in here, don't they?

15
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,541
Shall I, miss?

16
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,208
I'm perfectly capable,
thank you very much.

17
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:13,041
Well, we'll leave
the reloading for a minute.

18
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,499
You see, when I say "pull" --

19
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,416
Morning, Hastings!
Lovely day!

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,124
Morning, General!

21
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,541
Morning, ladies!

22
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,291
-Morning!
-Morning!

23
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,416
Well, now, Kitty,
why don't you have a try?

24
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,541
If you don't practice, you won't
be ready for the championship.

25
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,916
It's all set for the 14th.

26
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,374
Ah, morning, Mr. Russell.
Racing, eh?

27
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,583
Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

28
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,708
Bonjour, Captain Fowler.

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,291
Oh!
Good morning, M. Poirot.

30
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,749
Bonjour, Mlle. Morgan.

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,749
You're in good voice, eh?

32
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,458
Thanks to your Captain Hastings,
Mr. Poirot.

33
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,583
He's got us all organized.

34
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:55,124
Captain Hastings
is very good at that.

35
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,583
I thought the general
was awfully good last night,

36
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,124
with his recitations
from Swinburne.

37
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,791
Oh, yes, the general recites
poetry with true military vigor.

38
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,374
Perhaps your niece can also be
persuaded to entertain us

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,666
one evening.

40
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,541
Perhaps she will,
Mr. Poirot, perhaps she will.

41
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,416
Excuse me.

42
00:04:52,417 --> 00:05:01,291
John?

43
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,124
Of course, the actual wound
I got was ludicrously minor.

44
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,583
I felt a complete fraud.

45
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,208
I'm sure it wasn't minor.

46
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,624
Oh, I assure you it was.

47
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,666
Mind you, I was convinced
I was going to die.

48
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,416
But that's only
because I'm a coward.

49
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,041
Oh, John.

50
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,374
Oh, good morning, General.

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,541
Morning, Reverend.

52
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,208
Good morning, General Forbes.

53
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,624
Morning, Miss Henderson.

54
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,666
Fine day -- little breezy.

55
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,958
John?

56
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,791
Oh, good morning, M. Poirot.

57
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,458
Mme. Clapperton.

58
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,749
Have you seen John?

59
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,083
Ah, yes, he is on the foredeck,
madame.

60
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,583
Oh, shall I?

61
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,124
Sit down, M. Poirot.

62
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,166
I didn't see you at dinner
last night.

63
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,541
No, no, no.

64
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,791
It was just a shade choppy,
of course.

65
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,416
Well, no, I was --

66
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,791
Fortunately,
I am an excellent sailor.

67
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,624
The one thing I must not do
is overtire myself.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,749
I live so intensely, if you know
what I mean, M. Poirot.

69
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,791
Oh, yes.

70
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,166
As a matter of fact,

71
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,124
I nearly wore myself out
as a girl in the war.

72
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,499
My hospital.

73
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,541
You've heard about my hospital.

74
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,999
Of course, I had nurses and
matrons and that sort of thing,

75
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,208
but I actually ran it.

76
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,249
Your vitality is formidable,
dear lady.

77
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,999
"You're so alive, Adeline,"
they say to me,

78
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,166
but really, M. Poirot,

79
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,249
what would one be
if one wasn't alive?

80
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,666
Dead, madame.

81
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,958
I must find my husband.

82
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:57,208
You won't find sharks
in the Mediterranean.

83
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,874
Oh, there you are.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,999
Oh, hello, my dear.
I did find you a chair.

85
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,958
Would you like it in
or out of the sun?

86
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,333
Not in the sun, if possible.

87
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,541
Ah, right, there you are.

88
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,333
Are you -- Are you going to be
warm enough?

89
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,374
I'm freezing.

90
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,499
Oh, well, I'll find...

91
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,458
I'd take a hatchet to that woman
if I were her husband.

92
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,749
Bonjour, monsieur.

93
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,291
Ah. How's that?

94
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,958
I knew a woman like that once
in Hyderabad.

95
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,208
Absolutely poisonous.

96
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,958
In '87, that was.

97
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,458
And did anyone take a hatchet
to her?

98
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,083
No.

99
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,833
Last time I saw her,
she was on her third husband.

100
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,916
Oh.

101
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,416
Position is everything.

102
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,541
If you lose your balance,

103
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,041
you could swing round and shoot
a hole in the mast -- or worse.

104
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,999
Colonel Clapperton?

105
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,041
Colonel?

106
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,958
Such a soldierly looking man.

107
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,083
Soldierly?

108
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,624
He was in the Guards,
wasn't he, General Forbes?

109
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,999
Guards?

110
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,416
Before the war, that fellow was
on the music-hall stage.

111
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,291
No.

112
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,166
Fact -- music-hall stage.

113
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,499
War comes along,
they start letting anyone in.

114
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,958
Hun drops a stray bomb --
pure good luck --

115
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,874
he goes home with a flesh wound
in the arm.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
How did he meet Mrs. Clapperton?

117
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,791
Mrs. Clapperton?

118
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,458
Lady Pardot, she was then.

119
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:22,833
Really?

120
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,874
He got into her hospital
somehow.

121
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,583
Did it have anything to do with
him being wounded, do you think?

122
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,874
Oh, yes, he had to be wounded.

123
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:38,124
You should get a bit of
exercise, Miss Henderson.

124
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,166
Does you no good sitting
around thinking, you know.

125
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,749
No, I know.

126
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,999
Unfortunately, my religion
forbids it at this time of year.

127
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:51,666
Oh.

128
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,833
Right.

129
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,124
I mean, um -- Well.

130
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,708
Adeline.

131
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,749
Oh, hello, Dermot.

132
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:23,833
I've been trying to talk to you

133
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,541
ever since you both came
on board.

134
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,583
I don't see that we've a lot
to say to each other, have we?

135
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,416
Oh, surely, after all the...

136
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,666
What do you want?

137
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,333
I was just --

138
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,083
Were you spying on us?

139
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,499
I wanted to clear your trays,
ma'am.

140
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,624
Well, get on and do it, then.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,416
I am a happily married woman,
General Forbes.

142
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,083
It's her family
I feel sorry for.

143
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,374
"No soldier songs," I said,
"no Indian love lyrics."

144
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,958
What does she sing?

145
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:59,541
"The Army of Today's All Right"
and the "Kashmiri Love Song."

146
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,833
You can't expect no better
from civilians, sir.

147
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,749
We're all civilians now, Bates.

148
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,874
The trouble
with a cruise like this

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,249
is you're forced to suffer
amateur entertainment

150
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,541
night after night.

151
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,458
Oh, well, we rather enjoyed it,
didn't we, Molly?

152
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,208
What did you think,
Colonel Clapperton?

153
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,916
John would have been quite happy

154
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:27,333
to sit and listen to that
dreadful woman for hours.

155
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,458
He has no taste at all as far
as anything artistic goes.

156
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:31,833
It's true.

157
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,249
Mrs. Tolliver's artistic.

158
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,499
That must be a great solace
to you.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,749
We're really looking forward

160
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,458
to seeing the museum
in Alexandria tomorrow.

161
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,791
John and I won't be going
ashore.

162
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,499
We never bother
with antiquities.

163
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,541
One must live in the present,
don't you find?

164
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:58,208
My house has nothing in it
older than three years.

165
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,666
I'll have to be selling my car
next year, then, darling.

166
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,499
My car... I think, John.

167
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,499
Certainly, my dear.
Your car.

168
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:25,166
Voilà ce qu'on appelle
la "pukka sahib."

169
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,749
Twenty past 10:00.

170
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,291
Ah, indeed.

171
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,708
Well, what about bridge?

172
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,958
Bridge?

173
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,333
Yes, bridge.

174
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,999
Come on.
We can use the dining table.

175
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:45,333
Oh, may we join you?

176
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,416
What about you, Clapperton?

177
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:50,041
Oh, John won't play --
most tiresome of him.

178
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,791
Sorry.

179
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,374
You can join us if you like.

180
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,708
What was your name again?

181
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:57,416
Tolliver, Mrs. Tolliver.

182
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,624
And I'm her husband --
Mr. Tolliver.

183
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,416
What a clever arrangement.

184
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:10,041
-A kidnapping! A kidnapping!
-Kidnapping!

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,416
You're coming with us.
It's a kidnapping.

186
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,874
A Clapperton-napping!
To the boat deck!

187
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,416
Oh.

188
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,749
Don't be foolish, John.

189
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,249
You'll catch a chill.

190
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,791
Not with us, he won't.

191
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:24,583
We're hot stuff.

192
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,791
Anyway, there's a moon.

193
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,708
Bonsoir.

194
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,916
Do you ever go down
on your knees

195
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,083
and thank God you didn't have
any children?

196
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,083
Well, as a matter of fact,
we did.

197
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,333
Two --
a little boy and a little girl.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,458
Oh, for heaven's sake,
get on and deal.

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,458
I know it's the most awful
romantic cliché,

200
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,958
but the moon is beautiful,
isn't it?

201
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:21,874
Certainement.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,916
It is like
a giant oeuf en cocotte.

203
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,874
M. Poirot.

204
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,708
Honestly, I thought
you said you were going to play.

205
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,499
Mademoiselle,
I want to ask your advice

206
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,708
on a matter
of the English language.

207
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,874
I'm sure you don't need that.

208
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,499
Ah, mademoiselle is too amiable,
eh?

209
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,874
But, no, just now,

210
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,874
Mme. Clapperton said
that John won't play bridge.

211
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,499
Is not "can't play"
the usual term?

212
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,499
She takes it
as a personal insult

213
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,249
that he doesn't play, I suppose.

214
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,374
The man was a fool
ever to have married her.

215
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,291
Oh, many odious women
have devoted husbands, eh?

216
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,499
It is an enigma of nature.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,749
Which is perhaps why
the estimable Captain Hastings

218
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,374
has not yet taken the plunge
into matrimony.

219
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,749
Matrimony?

220
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,374
You're not entered for the
clay-pigeon championship yet,

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,583
are you, Miss Henderson?

222
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,916
Uh, no, I don't think
I really mean to --

223
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,458
Hastings, can't you talk
of something else for once?

224
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:22,499
No.

225
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,083
No, no, I'd love to talk about
the clay-pigeon championship,

226
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,833
but tomorrow, perhaps?

227
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,541
I have some letters to finish

228
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,583
that I want to post
in Alexandria.

229
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,708
Good night, Mlle. Henderson.

230
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:34,958
Good night.

231
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,874
Good night, Miss Henderson.

232
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,166
Good night.

233
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,999
Oh, Hastings, Hastings.

234
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,041
What?

235
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,083
Whatever is the use

236
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,791
of me introducing you
to nice young ladies

237
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,916
if all you do is talk about the
shooting of the clay pigeons?

238
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:48,958
But they like it.

239
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,541
You heard
what Miss Henderson said --

240
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,249
she'd love to talk about it
tomorrow.

241
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,416
Oh, Hastings, Hastings,
Hastings.

242
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,999
Now pick a card.

243
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,333
No, don't show me.

244
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,249
Now, remember what the card is
and put it back into the pack.

245
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,124
That's good.

246
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,874
Now, just a little shuffle.

247
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,749
Your card.

248
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,541
Geez!
Isn't that clever?

249
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,249
I see you enjoy playing cards,
monsieur,

250
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,124
even though
you do not play bridge.

251
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,583
I have my reasons
for not playing bridge.

252
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:39,916
I'll show you.

253
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,791
Sit down.
We'll play one hand.

254
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,249
You can shuffle the cards,
Mr. Poirot.

255
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,749
Voilà.

256
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,249
You see, any man who can deal
his partner and adversaries

257
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,916
any hand he pleases

258
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,291
had better stand aloof
from a friendly game of cards.

259
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,833
But how did you do it?

260
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,041
I mean, it all looked
perfectly ordinary.

261
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,833
Ah, the quickness of the hand
deceives the eye.

262
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,083
You could go on the stage
with that, Colonel Clapperton.

263
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:30,458
Yes. Quite.

264
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:36,083
Well, I hope I haven't bored you
with my little demonstration.

265
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:41,291
Goodnight, ladies, gentlemen.

266
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,666
Did I say something wrong?

267
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,499
I don't know, Hastings.

268
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:55,666
I really don't know.

269
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,166
Oh, we ought to get off now.

270
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:18,833
You'll come with us, won't you?

271
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:21,291
You wouldn't let us go ashore
by ourselves?

272
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,666
Hey, miss, miss, miss.

273
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:24,749
Oh! Please go away.

274
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,249
Genuine bits from the tombs
of the pharaohs.

275
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,166
I don't want any pharaohs' bits.

276
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,999
You see?
Awful things might happen to us.

277
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,624
Well, I certainly don't think
you should go alone.

278
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,791
Hooray!

279
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,166
But I'm not sure
if my wife feels up to it.

280
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,999
Hooray!
I mean, uh -- boo.

281
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,833
She can have a nice, long rest.

282
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,874
Yes.

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,166
Well, I'll go and have a word
with Adeline.

284
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,249
We'll come with you.

285
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,874
Yes, perhaps we can persuade her
to come.

286
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,791
Who's that?

287
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,416
Adeline, my dear, it's John.

288
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,416
The door's locked.

289
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,166
I don't want to be disturbed
by the stewards.

290
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,041
Bonjour, ladies.

291
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,541
We're trying to get him
to ourselves for the day.

292
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,166
Lure him into the suq.

293
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,541
Cajole him into the casbah.

294
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,041
What about coming ashore?

295
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,041
Certainly not.
I've had a very bad night.

296
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:37,166
I'll stay in bed
most of the day.

297
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,708
Well, I think I might go,
Adeline.

298
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:47,291
Oh, do as you like,
John, for heaven's sake.

299
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,833
Uh, do you mind if I just
come in and get my Baedeker?

300
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,624
Yes, I do mind.
I'm not getting out of bed.

301
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,291
Do go away, John, and let me
have a little peace.

302
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:05,333
We can go now.

303
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,416
What about your passport?

304
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,041
In my pocket.

305
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,416
Glory be!

306
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,749
Hey, miss, miss.

307
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,583
No, no, no, please, please,
I really must go.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,333
Real amber bits, miss.

309
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:37,749
Pharaoh's gold, miss.

310
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,416
How much are those amber ones?

311
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,499
300.

312
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,041
No, that's far too much.

313
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,416
Mine's 100, miss.

314
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,833
100 -- give the missus.

315
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,499
Oh, very well.
Look, I'll take the amber one.

316
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,499
But after that I really must go.

317
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,333
Here -- clear off, you.

318
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,124
You're not allowed down here.

319
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,041
Cheeky blighter.

320
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Ah, Hastings,
are you ready to go?

321
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,166
All set.

322
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,583
Going ashore, General Forbes?

323
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,249
Well, yes, very probably.

324
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,333
I'll see.

325
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,708
See you later.

326
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,624
I think we ought to avoid
the usual sort of tourist thing

327
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,916
as much as we can, Poirot.

328
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:46,666
Good, good. I am absolutely
in your hands, Hastings.

329
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,458
Be looking fiercer, savage.

330
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,166
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Hastings.

331
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,208
Now you look merely constipated.

332
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,583
It's all very well for you.

333
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,083
This camel's jolly uncomfortable
for sitting on.

334
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:49,458
It's sharp.

335
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,666
Good morning, M. Poirot.

336
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,458
Ah, bonjour, Mlle. Henderson.

337
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:54,666
Good morning, Captain Hastings.

338
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,999
Oh, good morning.

339
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,374
Like that.

340
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,791
Harder. Ready.

341
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,458
Doesn't he look dashing?

342
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,874
Oh, yes, indeed.

343
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,999
You know, he looks as if
he is summoning up the courage

344
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,333
to order the second tea cake.

345
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,374
M. Poirot, have you
seen the Clappertons ashore

346
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,416
this morning?

347
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,249
I believe Mme. Clapperton was
spending the day in her cabin.

348
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,624
Ah, and what about
Colonel Clapperton?

349
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,749
Ah, let me think.

350
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,708
He came ashore -- yes, no,
certainly, he came ashore.

351
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,083
It's just that there was
some talk last night

352
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,666
of us all coming ashore
together.

353
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:31,833
Ah.

354
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:35,999
M. Poirot?

355
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,583
Yes, mademoiselle?

356
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,749
Was Colonel Clapperton alone
when he came ashore?

357
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,124
Was he alone?

358
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,208
Let me think.

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,666
Maybe someone was with him.

360
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,999
Miss Mooney and Miss Cregan
perhaps?

361
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,374
Ah, yes, yes,
the two little girls, yes.

362
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,249
They're not children, M. Poirot.

363
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,666
Oh, no.

364
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,958
Nor am I.

365
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,166
No.

366
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,666
Ah.

367
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,416
Very good...

368
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,374
I say, Poirot --
look at these pomegranates.

369
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,666
Sorry?

370
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,208
I don't think they like you
to touch the fruit,

371
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:41,249
Captain Hastings.

372
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,083
Oh.
Sorry.

373
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:45,958
M. and Mme. Tolliver,
what a pleasant surprise.

374
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,499
Are you alone?

375
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,708
Oh, quite alone, yes.

376
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,666
Oh, that nice General Forbes
joined us for a while,

377
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,041
but he had to rush back.

378
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:56,333
He wasn't feeling at all
the thick.

379
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,833
-Gyppy tummy, I dare say.
-Oliver.

380
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,416
Now, we were just about
to take some lunch.

381
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,041
Would you care to join us?

382
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,333
Lunch?

383
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,999
In a native place, you mean?

384
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,499
I say.

385
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,541
Why not, Molly?
Let's give it a go.

386
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,291
Count me out, Poirot.

387
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,499
I think I'd better be getting
back to the ship.

388
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,124
Ah, must you desert us,
Hastings?

389
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,791
Ah, one or two things
to catch up on, you know.

390
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,583
Very well.

391
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:24,833
M. and Mme. Tolliver and I
will see you back on board ship

392
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:26,499
late afternoon.

393
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,249
Please.

394
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,791
We'll let the two girls go first

395
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,124
because they're
the least experienced.

396
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,999
Then it better be
General Forbes.

397
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,499
He's an old hand
at this sort of competition.

398
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,416
We can't do it in the middle
of Alexandria harbor, sir.

399
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,833
Oh, I don't see why not, Bates.

400
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:51,249
If we shoot in the general
direction of the open sea,

401
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,166
there's nothing much parked
out there.

402
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:54,458
Moored, sir.

403
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:55,499
Moored?

404
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,916
Well, I'm sure the harbor master

405
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:58,874
will have something to say
about it, sir.

406
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,458
Started in India, you know.

407
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:01,833
Beg your pardon?

408
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,624
Had its origins in India --
clay pigeons.

409
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,208
Oh, really?

410
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,291
In the 13th century.

411
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,458
Gosh,
it was bows and arrows then.

412
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,749
And they didn't have
that catapult thing.

413
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:23,041
Just had these fellows
with tremendously strong arms.

414
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,541
Oh, best to leave her to it,
I think.

415
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,666
Yes, she probably will.

416
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:51,999
Come along, Pamela!

417
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,708
Ah, Mlle. Mooney
and the Colonel Clapperton,

418
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,999
you had an enjoyable day ashore,
I trust?

419
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,749
-Absolutely.
-Good.

420
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,458
Come on, Pammy!

421
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,916
I'll see you at dinner, perhaps.

422
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,708
I hope so.

423
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:22,291
Adeline?

424
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,583
Adeline?

425
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,458
Adeline, my dear?

426
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,208
Adeline?

427
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,458
Huh. It's locked.

428
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:40,916
You do not have your key?

429
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,624
No.
I'll find a steward.

430
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,999
Ah.

431
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:45,999
-Ah, Poirot.
-Uh, steward!

432
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,624
We seem to be having
some trouble

433
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,041
with the clay-pigeon
championship.

434
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,083
Really?

435
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,916
It was originally planned, you
see, to take place on the 14th,

436
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,583
but it seems that we dock
at Haifa on the 13th.

437
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,041
And that's one of those places

438
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,958
where we more or less have to go
ashore and look at the ruins

439
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:02,499
while they revictual the ship.

440
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,416
Now, that leaves the 15th,
the 16th, and the 18th.

441
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,624
The 17th is no good

442
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,916
because that's the night
of the captain's party.

443
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:10,958
Oh, my God!

444
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:12,333
My God!

445
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:16,874
She -- She's dead.

446
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,416
Fetch the captain, mon ami.

447
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,583
Look at this, Poirot.

448
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,791
One of the souvenir sellers
must have dropped it.

449
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:49,166
The devils.

450
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,208
Colonel Clapperton,
what a tragedy.

451
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:01,541
Can you help us with this,
Mr. Poirot?

452
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:08,041
I want to avoid involving the
Egyptian police, if possible.

453
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,458
Yes, Captain, perhaps I can.

454
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,083
Is anything missing,

455
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,666
as far as you can tell,
Colonel Clapperton?

456
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,124
My wife always keeps -- kept --

457
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,416
always kept some cash

458
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,999
in the second drawer
of the dressing table.

459
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,499
It seems to have gone.

460
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,791
How much was that?

461
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,166
Between £20 and £30.

462
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:49,958
Anything else?

463
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,166
Her jewels.

464
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,874
There weren't very many.

465
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,458
Most of them were in
the captain's safe.

466
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,666
Well, perhaps you could let us
have a description of them?

467
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:00,874
Well, I'll try.

468
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,749
I don't know if I can remember
them very exactly.

469
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,958
No, no, no, no.

470
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:08,791
I know the headband thing she
was wearing last night has gone.

471
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,124
What can you tell me about this?

472
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,124
That's not my wife's.

473
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,041
You're quite sure?

474
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:23,083
Quite. She'd never wear
a thing like that.

475
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,041
It was found on the floor,
between the two beds.

476
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,499
Then someone
must have dropped it there.

477
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,624
Would you say that your wife had
any enemies?

478
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:41,291
Certainly not.

479
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,041
Colonel Clapperton,
you have been most helpful.

480
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,499
Thank you very much.

481
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,999
May I offer you my condolences.

482
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,749
If there's anything we can do,
Colonel...

483
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,208
Thank you, Captain.

484
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,624
There's nothing.

485
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,083
Nothing can bring Adeline
back again.

486
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:13,416
Good God.

487
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:15,958
Murdered, General Forbes.

488
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,791
Good God above.

489
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:31,833
You were acquainted with Mme.
Clapperton before this voyage,

490
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:35,458
I think?

491
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,583
I knew Adeline
when she was Lady Pardot.

492
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:43,374
I knew her before that,
when she was Adeline French.

493
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:47,833
I was ADC to her father back in
'92, when she was 7 years old.

494
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:53,333
Good God,
I can hardly believe it.

495
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,291
I was in love with her
for years.

496
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,749
She was not always
the silly woman she became.

497
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,791
You must not incriminate
yourself, monsieur.

498
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,958
Incriminate myself?
How could I?

499
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,374
M. and Mme. Tolliver tell me

500
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,958
that you came back to the ship
before lunch.

501
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,374
What of it?

502
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,374
Saying that you were ill?

503
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:28,791
No.

504
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:30,624
All right, no.

505
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,583
I came back to talk to Adeline.

506
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,249
I hadn't seen her for 17 years,

507
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,791
not since the war,
just after Pardot died.

508
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,791
I thought there might be
a chance for me yet.

509
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:47,333
But I didn't, uh...

510
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,333
I mean, she was in mourning.

511
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:54,583
Of course, that didn't deter
a man like Clapperton.

512
00:32:56,084 --> 00:33:00,458
You came back to the ship
to talk to Mme. Clapperton?

513
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:02,958
Yes.

514
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,458
Tell me what happened
when you got back to the ship.

515
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,291
Well, nothing happened.

516
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:12,541
I went to her cabin and knocked,
but she didn't reply.

517
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,833
So I went back to mine...

518
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:24,374
and had a nap.

519
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:35,666
Well, what do you say,
Mr. Poirot?

520
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:40,124
One cannot hurry
the little gray cells, Captain.

521
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,208
You rounded up
the souvenir wallas yet?

522
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:45,333
Yes.

523
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,708
Actually, one of them identified
Miss Henderson

524
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,583
as having bought
an amber necklace.

525
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:50,958
Really?

526
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:53,833
Come in.

527
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,708
Yes, Bates?

528
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,166
I've carried out my examination
of the body, sir.

529
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,124
And?

530
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,249
Oh.

531
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,666
The deceased died from a knife
wound to the upper thorax, sir.

532
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,249
Good God, Bates, we can all see
that for ourselves.

533
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:14,291
I'm sorry, sir, but I've
only got me first-aid book,

534
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,624
haven't I?

535
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,666
At what time did she die,
M. Bates?

536
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,458
Oh, it's difficult to say, sir,

537
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,458
what with the weather being
so warm and --

538
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,833
Never mind about that, Bates.

539
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,499
What we want to know is -- what
time was Mrs. Clapperton killed?

540
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,583
About 10:00 this morning, sir.

541
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:36,708
10:00, eh?

542
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,499
Give or take an hour or two,
sir.

543
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,791
Oh, dear God.

544
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,541
It's all right, Kitty.

545
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:51,958
You weren't to know, old thing.

546
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,208
Who is it?

547
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:57,208
It is I, Hercule Poirot.

548
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:00,874
All right, Kitty.

549
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,541
Oh, hello, M. Poirot.

550
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,749
Bonsoir, Mlle. Cregan.

551
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,708
May I come in for a minute,
please?

552
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:09,916
Well...

553
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,499
I-I only have one question.

554
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,208
No, it's just that Kitty's
making such a blessed racket.

555
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,749
Oh, dear, dear.

556
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:22,041
She blames herself, you see.

557
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,208
Well, and me.

558
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,249
But how can she blame herself?

559
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:32,833
Well, we did say some pretty
dreadful things about her.

560
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,208
My dear Mlle. Cregan,

561
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:37,666
if everyone on board

562
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:40,416
who had said unpleasant things
about Mme. Clapperton

563
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,708
were to make as much noise
as your friend,

564
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,958
this vessel would become
a danger to shipping.

565
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,041
There!

566
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,583
You hear that, old girl?

567
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,708
What was the one question?

568
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,041
Oh, it is quite simple, really.

569
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,208
You both left the ship
this morning at 9:30

570
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,083
with the Colonel Clapperton,
yes?

571
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,208
You know we did.
You saw us.

572
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,249
Précisément.

573
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,291
So, please tell me --

574
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:09,124
was Colonel Clapperton with you
for the whole day,

575
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,249
until you got back to the ship
at 4:00 this afternoon?

576
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,166
Yes, absolutely,
every minute of the day.

577
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,791
He doesn't think --

578
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,083
Oh, no!

579
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:20,249
Ohh.

580
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,999
Every minute of the day,
you say?

581
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,166
Absolutely.

582
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,041
Well...

583
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,041
Yes?

584
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,041
Well, we went to a café
for some tea at about 12:00.

585
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,041
Uh-huh.

586
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,999
And he --
Colonel Clapperton, that is --

587
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,208
Well, he went to the, you know,
for a couple of minutes.

588
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,791
Ah, I understand.

589
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:47,541
But just for a couple
of minutes, you say.

590
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,541
Well, one doesn't time it.

591
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,708
Oh, no, you don't!

592
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,249
You've got one or two questions
to answer, my lad,

593
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:21,458
unless I'm very much mistaken.

594
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,541
I didn't kill her.

595
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:42,916
You had her jewelry.

596
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,041
Jewelry?

597
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,416
She was rich.

598
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,124
What did it matter to her?

599
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,749
Come, M. Skinner!

600
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,833
Mme. Clapperton is dead!

601
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,708
You are caught red-handed by
my colleague, Captain Hastings,

602
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,208
trying to sell the jewelry
of Mme. Clapperton!

603
00:38:58,334 --> 00:38:59,791
You admit that you let yourself
into her cabin --

604
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,291
She was dead already.

605
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,749
I shouldn't have took it,
not when I saw she was dead.

606
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:10,583
If I'd known
there'd be trouble...

607
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,333
Do you believe him?

608
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:27,291
Yes, I think I do.

609
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,166
Me too.

610
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,916
So, we're back
to the souvenir hawkers.

611
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,583
Why do you not consider
one of the passengers, Hastings?

612
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,624
The passengers?

613
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,999
Well, who?

614
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,041
Colonel Clapperton?

615
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,666
Got a watertight alibi.

616
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,499
General Forbes?

617
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,999
What about Mlle. Henderson?

618
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,541
Really?
No.

619
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,833
Well, I think perhaps
she has the motive, no?

620
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,124
She's a lady, Poirot.

621
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,458
And you think, mon ami, that
ladies do not commit murder?

622
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,416
Ladies don't get found out.

623
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:09,041
Mme. Clapperton had been
dead for at least five hours

624
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,166
when she was found.

625
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:13,416
A small amount of money
and some jewelry had been taken.

626
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,583
A string of beads was on
the floor, near to her bed.

627
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,083
The door was locked
and the key missing.

628
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,999
And the hatch which gives
onto the deck was open.

629
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,458
What are you driving at, Poirot?

630
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:30,083
Mme. Clapperton had locked
the door from the inside.

631
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,541
We actually heard her say so
herself.

632
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,166
If Mrs. Clapperton
could lock the door,

633
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,624
she could unlock it, too,
I suppose.

634
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,291
Précisément, precisely,

635
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,833
which leads us
to the inescapable conclusion

636
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:44,124
that Mme. Clapperton unlocked
the door

637
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,499
and let in the murderer.

638
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,208
Miss Henderson,
I hope you don't mind me asking,

639
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:59,124
but you bought an amber necklace
yesterday, didn't you?

640
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,499
Yes, I did.

641
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,958
How did you know that?

642
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,291
The captain mentioned it.

643
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,416
He just happened to mention it.

644
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,041
Would you mind
if I had a look at it?

645
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,999
I'm afraid I've lost it.

646
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:14,166
I must have dropped it
somewhere, put it down.

647
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,499
I don't know.

648
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:17,874
Yes. Right.

649
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,333
Of course.

650
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,708
I thought Mrs. Clapperton

651
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:25,999
a very unpleasant woman.

652
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:29,541
In fact, I don't think anyone
on board ship really liked her,

653
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:32,708
but, surely, who would have
reason to kill her?

654
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,916
Mademoiselle, it is the opinion

655
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,916
of every person on board
the ship

656
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,416
that the Colonel Clapperton
would have been quite justified

657
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:40,999
in taking a hatchet to her.

658
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:44,416
Now, that was an expression
I actually heard used.

659
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,541
But he had an alibi.

660
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:50,916
He was onshore all day
with the two girls,

661
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,291
and he did not return to the
ship until 4:00 that afternoon,

662
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:59,416
by which time Mme. Clapperton
had been dead for many hours.

663
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,624
Seems to me we're back
to General Forbes

664
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,916
as our only suspect.

665
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,916
Ah, bonsoir, Mlle. Morgan.

666
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,208
I want, please, to ask a favor
of your niece.

667
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,458
Our niece?

668
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:45,833
Very well.

669
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:48,916
Ismene?

670
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:52,041
Good evening, Ismene.

671
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,999
I want to borrow somebody
from you, if I may.

672
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,916
Uh... ladies and gentlemen...

673
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,541
tonight I shall offer you
a garland

674
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,083
from our national poet,
Mr. Rudyard Kipling,

675
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,874
starting with "The Ladies."

676
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,458
"I've taken my fun
where I've found it,

677
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:27,041
I've rogued an' I've ranged
in my time.

678
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,458
I've 'ad my pickin'
o' sweet'earts.

679
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:31,166
An' four o' the lot was prime.

680
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,291
One was an 'arf-caste widow.

681
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,374
One was a woman from Prome.

682
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,583
One was the wife
of a jemadar-sais.

683
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,499
An' one is a girl at 'ome.

684
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,999
"Now --"

685
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,374
Pardon me, Mr. Russell.

686
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,499
Oh, that's all right.

687
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,916
Uh -- "Now I aren't no 'and
with the ladies.

688
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,208
-For, takin' 'em all --"
-I'm sorry.

689
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:53,249
I-I have to make
an announcement.

690
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,708
If you'll be good enough
to sit down, sir.

691
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,666
You come and join us,
Mr. Russell.

692
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,458
Ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:04,666
you all know what a tragedy
occurred yesterday.

694
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:20,958
And I am sure you will all
want to cooperate

695
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:23,958
in bringing the perpetrator
of the foul crime to book.

696
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:27,416
As you know, we are fortunate
enough to have on board with us

697
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:28,791
Mr. Hercule Poirot,

698
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,666
who is probably known to you all

699
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,749
as a man who has wide experience
in such matters.

700
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:37,208
I hope you'll listen carefully
to what he has to say.

701
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,999
Mr. Poirot.

702
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:44,249
Thank you, Captain Fowler.

703
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:55,041
Mesdames et messieurs,

704
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,999
what I am about to do
may surprise you a little.

705
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,916
It may occur to you that
I am eccentric, perhaps mad.

706
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:05,958
Ah, you may say,

707
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:10,916
"The little Belgian detective is
taking leave of his rocker," eh?

708
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,374
But I can assure you,
behind my madness is,

709
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:21,833
as you English say...

710
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,416
method.

711
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,749
So...

712
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:35,666
Voilà.

713
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:39,833
A suitcase.

714
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:42,791
How uninteresting.

715
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,916
Nothing is less interesting
than a suitcase, yes?

716
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:50,916
And you are right, except...

717
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:57,458
suitcases have contents.

718
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,749
It's a doll.

719
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,249
Yes, a doll.

720
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,458
Except this doll...

721
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,333
is an important witness...

722
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:31,541
to the truth of who killed...

723
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,416
Mme. Clapperton.

724
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:45,374
But how is it this doll
can tell us what it knows, huh?

725
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:52,249
But this is a doll...
that can speak.

726
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,874
You have not heard of dolls
that can speak?

727
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,416
Yes, of course you have.

728
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:04,666
All we have to do is put this
doll back in the suitcase --

729
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:12,374
ah --
where we cannot see her.

730
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,833
She does not like to be seen,
this little lady.

731
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:22,958
Do you, ma petite?

732
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:26,416
-No!
-Ah.

733
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,666
Now, can you tell us anything

734
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:38,041
about the death
of Mme. Clapperton?

735
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:42,833
What is it, John?

736
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,416
Door's locked.

737
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:47,499
The door's locked.

738
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,624
Don't want to be disturbed
by the stewards.

739
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,833
I don't want to be
disturbed by the stewards.

740
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,541
Y-You --

741
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,416
Stop him, somebody.

742
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:27,124
Yes.

743
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,083
Take him to my quarters.

744
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,374
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you would clear the room.

745
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,541
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

746
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,083
Did I do it right, Mr. Poirot?

747
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:56,458
Oh, yes... ma petite.

748
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:03,958
It was you, General,
who gave me a valuable hint

749
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,208
with your mention
of the music-hall stage.

750
00:49:07,834 --> 00:49:09,083
I puzzle, eh?

751
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,749
I think.

752
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,666
And then,
the evening before the crime,

753
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:19,708
Colonel Clapperton pretended to
give himself away.

754
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,374
He wanted us to believe
that he was a conjurer

755
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,708
because then it would
never occur to us

756
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:30,749
that he was, in fact,
a ventriloquist.

757
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,499
And that's what he did

758
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,708
when you heard him talking
to Mrs. Clapperton

759
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:35,833
through her cabin door.

760
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:37,208
Précisément.

761
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,291
And by then,
she was already dead.

762
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:45,458
Excuse me.

763
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,249
What about the necklace
on the floor?

764
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,124
Was it Miss Henderson's?

765
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,708
No, it was put there
to make us think

766
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,624
that some native thief
was the killer.

767
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:05,624
But that it cast suspicion on
someone who really cared for him

768
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:07,749
was the cruel irony.

769
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,666
Pardon.

770
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:29,249
I am sorry, mademoiselle.

771
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:32,958
He didn't do it for me.

772
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,416
It was those girls' youth.

773
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,124
It made him feel his slavery.

774
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,916
He wanted to be free
before it was too late.

775
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,333
We all have such dreams.

776
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:50,416
When did you guess it was him?

777
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:54,583
His self-control
was too perfect.

778
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:59,083
No matter how galling was
the conduct of his wife,

779
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,958
it never seemed to touch him.

780
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:04,916
That either meant
that he was so used to it

781
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,958
that it no longer stung,

782
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:12,791
or else he knew his bondage
would soon be over.

783
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:20,583
It was a cruel, dirty trick
you played, M. Poirot.

784
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,249
I do not approve of murder.

785
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,583
Mademoiselle.
