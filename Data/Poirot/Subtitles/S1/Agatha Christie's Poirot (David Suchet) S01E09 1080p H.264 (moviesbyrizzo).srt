1
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:37,041
I'm not sure we should expect
to see each other again.

2
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,541
I couldn't bear that.

3
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,958
I have to see you again.

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,416
Please.

5
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,124
God, you're so beautiful.

6
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,916
Ahmed.

7
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,124
I'm married.

8
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,499
No! No! No!

9
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,958
All right, everybody.
Cut.

10
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,333
Cut.

11
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,583
Will someone please tell me

12
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,458
what these actors
are meant to be doing?

13
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,124
I'm wrong!
I must be wrong!

14
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,416
I thought this was a love scene!

15
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,624
My dear Valerie,

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,458
you are not discussing
the weather with this man.

17
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:16,541
You are about to commit adultery
with him!

18
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,624
Make a big pause before you say,
"I'm married."

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,083
"Ahmed."
Count to five.

20
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,458
You turn, then say your line.

21
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,041
Okay?
Let's see it.

22
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,999
Ahmed.

23
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,208
-I'm married.
-No, darling.

24
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,624
Can you count to five?

25
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,208
I did.

26
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,124
Count to 10, then.

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,291
This is no hide-and-seek
counting, my dear.

28
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,624
One... two... three...
four... five...

29
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,249
six... seven... eight...
nine... ten!

30
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,541
You got it?!

31
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,333
Good morning.

32
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,791
Captain Hastings and M. Poirot,
guests of Bunny Saunders.

33
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:26,333
Ah, yes.

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,416
Very young, of course, to be
directing his first picture.

35
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,041
But what a break, getting
Valerie Saintclair to star.

36
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,833
Yes.
Films are very boring, Hastings.

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,583
But the actors
who are paid to deceive us,

38
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,833
now, they are interesting, huh?

39
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,374
Quiet on the set!

40
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,541
Red-line bell.

41
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,999
Roll camera.

42
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,958
-218, take 11.

43
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,833
Action.

44
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,791
What was that Ahmed doing here?

45
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,499
He's come to see to the horses.

46
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,374
Oh, that's his excuse, is it?

47
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,916
Is that not Ralph Walton?

48
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,083
He was a big star
before the talkies.

49
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,416
-Shh.
-...with the horses.

50
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,791
Spends too much --

51
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,249
Spends too much time
hanging around --

52
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,208
hanging around here,
if you ask me.

53
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,374
Oh, Bernard, he doesn't!

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,166
I'm sorry, dear boy.
I'm dry.

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,458
-The old brain buzz is gone.
-Cut. Cut.

56
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,249
All right, everyone,
let's take a short break.

57
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,916
Going. Going.

58
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,249
I don't want to hear
anything more.

59
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,374
-Mr. Reedburn --
-And now, you understand?

60
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,166
Bunny.

61
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,916
Arthur, old love,
glad you could make it.

62
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,041
Wonderful to see you.

63
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,958
May I introduce my good friend
M. Hercule Poirot?

64
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,583
Enchanté, monsieur.

65
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,249
Miss Deloy,
I want to see Miss Saintclair

66
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,958
in my office immediately.

67
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,249
Yes, Mr. Reedburn.

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,499
Poirot, I must apologize
for Reedburn.

69
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,874
He's the head of the studio.

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,499
No matter.

71
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,249
He is obviously a busy man.

72
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,999
Yes. He's just instructed me
to sack Ralph Walton.

73
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,624
Good God.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,708
The truth is,
old Ralph is past his best.

75
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,166
But get him on a good day,

76
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,791
and you won't find
a better actor anywhere.

77
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,583
I suppose I've got to do it.

78
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,458
Reedburn really hates him.

79
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
Please forgive me
for just one...

80
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,249
What a terrible thing.

81
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,624
Ah, M. Poirot.

82
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:42,958
Good morning, Your Highness.

83
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,958
Oh, Paul, please,
after all you did for my family.

84
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,791
Oh, not at all.

85
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,249
And what brings you
to Parade Studios?

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,999
Sheer good fortune, eh.

87
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,958
My associate,
Captain Hastings...

88
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,166
How do you do?

89
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,666
...and your director
are very old friends.

90
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,458
Oh, excellent.
Well, welcome.

91
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,874
Thank you.

92
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,999
You treat me like a child!

93
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,624
I'm the biggest box-office draw
this studio has.

94
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,833
True.

95
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,541
But without the studio,
you would be nothing.

96
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,416
Without me, you wouldn't
even be in pictures.

97
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,083
Perhaps I would have
been better off.

98
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,624
Perhaps, but I doubt it.

99
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,624
You're too ambitious for that.

100
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,958
You know, you are even more
beautiful when you're angry.

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,541
Have you thought any more about
my little proposition, my dear?

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,083
Hmm?

103
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,624
You swine!

104
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,499
Mr. Walton, please.
This is highly irregular.

105
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,541
What's the matter,
my dear Ralph?

106
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,958
You're the matter, you skunk!

107
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,708
What?

108
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,791
You haven't even got the guts
to sack me to my face!

109
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,333
Oh, my good God!

110
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,958
Well, well, well.

111
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,708
Hmm.

112
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,708
You seem to have lost your
manners, as well as your talent.

113
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,791
For shame.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,208
You used to be
such civilized company.

115
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,041
To get level with a snake,
you have to crawl on the ground.

116
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,374
See that Mr. Walton is escorted
off the premises at once.

117
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,166
You haven't heard the last
of me, Reedburn.

118
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,374
Are you all right, Henry?

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
'Course I'm all right.

120
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,708
And don't call me Henry.

121
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,874
Go.

122
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,541
Mm.

123
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,916
Paul.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,249
He's an animal.

125
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:09,833
There, there.

126
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,124
It's all right, my darling.

127
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,583
I tell you, I have a good mind

128
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,791
to withdraw my backing
from this picture.

129
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,958
As long as you're with me,
I can bear it.

130
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:29,499
Just promise me that you won't
see Reedburn on your own again.

131
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,249
Yes.

132
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,249
Yes, I promise.

133
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,083
Action.

134
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,708
It's a bad wound.

135
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,499
You're lucky it's in your arm.

136
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,374
And my people struggle.

137
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,791
One life counts for nothing.

138
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,708
I'll do my best.

139
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,124
But you ought to see
my husband.

140
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:08,041
I feel that I shall
be safe in your hands.

141
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,666
Cut! Super.

142
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,958
What is missing, Bunny,
is sex appeal!

143
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,791
Ugh!

144
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,666
The demure doctor's wife
is drawn irresistibly

145
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,916
towards this handsome
young fellow!

146
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,249
She knows
she will be unfaithful.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,416
It's the way of women.
They cannot help themselves.

148
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,499
They are putty in the hands
of the wild demon

149
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,708
that lurks in all of them.

150
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:44,208
Why can't I
have another drink, eh?!

151
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,249
Why can't I have another drink?

152
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,749
Just because bloody Reedburn
owns the studio or something?

153
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,041
What if he does?

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,249
He doesn't own me!

155
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,333
And I can have a drink
if I like.

156
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,333
I'll show him.

157
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,583
Mr. Reedburn's house
just coming up, miss.

158
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,749
Stop just here.

159
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,458
Three bob, love, please.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,499
Thank you.

161
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:58,249
No, Inspector, something
really terrible has happened.

162
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,666
Please send some men at once.

163
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,708
Thank you.

164
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,333
Hello?

165
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:27,958
Is that Hercule Poirot?

166
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,166
-Yes.
-It's Paul of Maurania.

167
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,916
Oh. Your Highness.

168
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,833
Please, Poirot -- Paul.

169
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,208
Pardon. Paul.

170
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,999
The most awful thing's
happened, Poirot.

171
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,874
I desperately need your help.

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,041
Yes.

173
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,499
Valerie is in trouble.
Serious trouble.

174
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,541
Mon Dieu.
Is she with you?

175
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:46,958
No, she's just telephoned.

176
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,249
I'll do anything I can
to help.

177
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,583
You see, Poirot, Valerie and I
are engaged to be married.

178
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,041
I had no idea.

179
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,291
No, no.
No, it's not generally known.

180
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,499
My family would never approve

181
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,249
if there was the slightest hint
of scandal.

182
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,249
Where is Mlle. Saintclair now?

183
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,583
She's at a house
near Reedburn's.

184
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,749
It's called The Willows.

185
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,333
How did she come there?

186
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,374
She just ran
to the nearest house.

187
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:16,708
Is she implicated
in a criminal matter?

188
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,083
I fear so.

189
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,999
Whatever your family
might think, my friend,

190
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,624
you must call the police.

191
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,249
That's already happened.

192
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,916
-They have been called?
-Yes.

193
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,291
Excellent.

194
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:30,374
Be straightforward with them,
and they will be discreet.

195
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,291
I was against it at first,

196
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,749
but the people at The Willows,
the Oglanders, insisted.

197
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,333
Yes.

198
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,374
But I'm worried
about the publicity.

199
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,916
I will do everything in my power
to protect your reputation.

200
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,249
But I must know
exactly what happened.

201
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,708
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

202
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,291
All right.

203
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,374
Police.
Chief Inspector Japp.

204
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,624
We've had a report
of a disturbance here.

205
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,999
Disturbance?

206
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,249
In the library.

207
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,541
And you are?

208
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,749
Frampton,
Mr. Reedburn's manservant, sir.

209
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,374
Where is it, then?

210
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,333
The library?
It's over here, sir.

211
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,166
One moment, sir.

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,541
Holy mother of God!

213
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,916
Don't touch, sir,
if you don't mind.

214
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,416
Well, it all happened

215
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,416
so quickly, Chief Inspector.

216
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,666
The four of us
were playing bridge

217
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,583
when suddenly there was
this commotion at the window.

218
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,041
We were astonished to see a
young lady beating at the panes.

219
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,791
Absolutely terrified,
she looked.

220
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,624
Did you happen to notice what
time this was, Mrs. Oglander?

221
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:33,208
It must have been around 10:00.

222
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,291
Yes, I remember
the clock in the hall

223
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,291
chiming the hour
a little before.

224
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,416
Please go on, madam.

225
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,458
Well, Ronnie got up
to let her in.

226
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,124
She was very out of breath.

227
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,333
It seems she'd run across
the gardens from Mon Désire.

228
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,041
Did she say anything?

229
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,874
Yes.

230
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,708
"Murder.

231
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,541
He's been murdered."

232
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,791
"Murder.
He's been murdered."

233
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,791
You're sure of it?

234
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,583
I shall not forget those words

235
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,958
for as long as I live,
Chief Inspector.

236
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,208
Then she fainted, poor girl.

237
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,791
And, of course, we immediately
telephoned the police.

238
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,833
Hmm.

239
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,583
Did any of you recognize her?

240
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:28,749
I thought there was something
vaguely familiar about her,

241
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:33,208
but it was Geraldine who guessed
that it was Valerie Saintclair.

242
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,624
She's a tremendous fan of hers.

243
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,374
Aren't you, darling?

244
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,916
Now, remember, mon ami,
it is important

245
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,458
that we keep a discreet silence
about our connection

246
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,666
with Prince Paul
and Mlle. Saintclair.

247
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,583
Oh, yes. Right.

248
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,374
The police took away the body
early this morning, sir.

249
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,624
Otherwise,
the room is untouched.

250
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:27,833
And the curtains were drawn
last night?

251
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,958
Yes, sir, I draw
all the curtains every evening.

252
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,374
So, who has drawn back this one?

253
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,374
I couldn't say, sir.
Possibly Mr. Reedburn did.

254
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,208
What is this house?

255
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,416
That's The Willows, sir,

256
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:55,499
neighbors of Mr. Reedburn,
name of Oglander, I believe.

257
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,499
Ah, yes.

258
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,208
The Oglanders.

259
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:01,749
Excuse me, please.

260
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,291
Thank you.

261
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,624
And this window
overlooks the drive, no?

262
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,999
That's right, sir.

263
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,374
Tell me,

264
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,916
was M. Reedburn expecting
any visitors late last night?

265
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,708
He didn't say so, sir.

266
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,666
But after Mr. Saunders
had left --

267
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,333
-Bunny Saunders?
-That's right, sir.

268
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,166
He and Mr. Reedburn
were viewing rushes

269
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,624
in the projection theater.

270
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,833
Mr. Saunders left at about 9:30,
I think it was.

271
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,749
And later?

272
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,166
Well, sir, Mr. Reedburn
gave instructions

273
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,208
he was not to be disturbed --
in the library, that is.

274
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,874
And you saw nobody arrive?

275
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,083
No, sir, but, of course,
they may have come in

276
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,916
by the side door
without my knowing.

277
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:52,374
May I?

278
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,666
Thank you.

279
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,124
Was M. Reedburn in the habit

280
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,458
of admitting visitors
late at night by this door?

281
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,708
I believe so, sir.

282
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,749
And you heard nothing
from the library

283
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,833
after M. Reedburn
had retired there?

284
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,374
Well, I can't be sure,

285
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,166
but I thought I heard
a woman's voice.

286
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,083
-A woman's voice?
-Yes, sir.

287
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416
I may have imagined it,
of course,

288
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,708
because that's what
I would have expected to hear,

289
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,291
if you see what I mean, sir.

290
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,749
Quite so.

291
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,333
We're looking for
a blunt instrument, quite wide,

292
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,041
not like a poker, but heavy.

293
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,124
You start upstairs.

294
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,874
Dear, oh, dear.

295
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,208
Here we go again.

296
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,624
My dear Chief Inspector Japp.

297
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,791
You have cracked this case
already, perhaps, no?

298
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,416
It won't be long, Poirot.

299
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,458
Have you ever heard
of a Valerie Saintclair?

300
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,083
Saintclair.

301
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,666
The film star.

302
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,791
I've just been talking to her,
as a matter of fact.

303
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,249
Very intelligent girl.

304
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,124
It was her discovered the body.

305
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,333
-Film star.
-Oh, yes.

306
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:20,749
She was frightened, of course,

307
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,416
so she ran off to that house
over there, The Willows.

308
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,333
Hmm.

309
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,708
But what was she doing here,
Inspector?

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,541
I understand it was very late.

311
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,499
Business.

312
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,541
Mr. Reedburn
was a film producer.

313
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,041
They don't keep office hours,
you know, Poirot.

314
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,208
Valerie -- uh, Miss Saintclair,
that is -- spotted an intruder,

315
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,374
which makes my life
a lot easier.

316
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,166
There's a lot of Gypsies
around here, apparently.

317
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:47,874
Mr. Reedburn wasn't exactly
a favorite of theirs.

318
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,249
He tried to have them moved on
several times.

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,416
What was the cause of death,
would you say?

320
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,166
A blow to the back of the head.

321
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,291
There was also bruising
between the eyes,

322
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,499
but the fatal injury
was to the head.

323
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:03,083
You can still see the blood.

324
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,083
So, he was lying on his back?

325
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,458
Correct.

326
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,041
Perhaps he fell back
against this.

327
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,249
Well, there would be
blood traces on that arm.

328
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,624
Unless they were washed away.

329
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:28,583
Why would anyone want to make
an accident look like murder?

330
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,624
True enough.
True enough.

331
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,874
But one thing still puzzles me.

332
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,666
Why does Mlle. Saintclair
run to The Willows

333
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,791
instead of the house at
the front, which is much nearer?

334
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,083
Oh, that's simple.

335
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:48,124
As the body was here
and this curtain was drawn back,

336
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,666
the lights from that house would
be the first you'd see at night.

337
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,208
But of course.

338
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:58,624
You are several steps ahead
of me, my dear Chief Inspector.

339
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,291
You mustn't get discouraged,
Poirot.

340
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,291
When you've been around
as long as I have,

341
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:03,833
you develop a nose
for this sort of thing.

342
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,916
Hmm.

343
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,124
Mon coeur.

344
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:19,416
Poor Valerie Saintclair had to
come this way in the dark.

345
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,124
Do you reckon Japp's
onto something?

346
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,374
This Gypsy business, I mean.

347
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,833
A man like Reedburn
had enemies, huh?

348
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,958
Too many.

349
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,958
Ah.

350
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,999
Would you mind waiting in here
for a moment, sirs?

351
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,458
Merci.

352
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,333
Ah.

353
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,624
La famille, Hastings.

354
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:17,958
No bond is so strong.

355
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,749
Yes.

356
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,666
Good morning, gentlemen.

357
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,333
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

358
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:26,583
You're from the police?

359
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,333
No, no, no, no, not at all.

360
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:29,833
Pardon.

361
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,166
Voilà.

362
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,041
We are acting
in a private capacity

363
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,666
for a dear friend
of Mlle. Saintclair.

364
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,583
I see.

365
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,249
How can I help you?

366
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,916
You must excuse the room,
by the way.

367
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,208
The police have instructed us

368
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,999
to leave things
exactly as they were.

369
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,124
No, no. Of course.
I understand.

370
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,124
You were playing bridge
last night.

371
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,499
Yes.

372
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,374
And you yourself were sitting...

373
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,166
There, facing the window.

374
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,166
Ah.

375
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,999
I was partnering my mother

376
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,583
and had just bid one no trump
when it happened,

377
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,708
when Miss Saintclair
appeared at the window, I mean.

378
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,208
You had been playing for long?

379
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:10,624
Perhaps an hour or so.

380
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,958
We'd played several rubbers.

381
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,999
Mlle. Saintclair is still here,
is she not?

382
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,208
Yes.

383
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,208
Thank you.

384
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,124
Come in.

385
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,791
M. Poirot, Captain Hastings.
Thank you for coming.

386
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,166
Mademoiselle.

387
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,249
Please.

388
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,749
Merci.

389
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,416
I saw you on the set yesterday.

390
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:08,874
Ah.

391
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,333
Paul insisted on calling you
last night.

392
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:14,291
Perhaps you could tell us
what happened.

393
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,958
It was dreadful.

394
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,083
Utterly dreadful.

395
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,499
You might as well know
Reedburn was blackmailing me.

396
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:29,666
I can't tell you why,
so please don't ask me,

397
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,874
but for Paul's sake,
for both our sakes,

398
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,291
I tried to come to terms
with him.

399
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,833
Dear God, I can't say
I'm sorry he's dead.

400
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,749
But believe me,
I didn't kill him.

401
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,124
I swear it.

402
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:46,249
Just tell me what happened,
my dear lady.

403
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,291
I agreed to meet him last night.

404
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,833
I was desperate, you understand.

405
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,333
Well, last week, he forced me

406
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,791
to sign another three-year
contract with the studio.

407
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,416
But he wanted still more.

408
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,666
More?

409
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,374
He said he was in love with me.

410
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,208
I don't need to tell you
what he was after.

411
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,291
I could see no way out.

412
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,166
He asked me to meet him
last night in the library

413
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:17,083
at a quarter to 10:00.

414
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,583
Courage, mademoiselle.

415
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,916
When I entered,
it appeared to be empty.

416
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,333
Then I saw it... by the window --
the body on the floor.

417
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,624
To my horror,
I realized it was Reedburn.

418
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:45,166
I could tell at once
he was dead.

419
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,416
I was about to call out when
something made me look 'round.

420
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,499
A curtain twitched
on the other side of the room,

421
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,999
and my heart stopped.

422
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:54,874
At the foot of the curtain,

423
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,916
I could clearly see
a pair of feet.

424
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,749
Someone was there.

425
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,249
My God, all I could think of
was getting away, M. Poirot.

426
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,333
I-I saw the lights of this house
in the darkness,

427
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:09,166
and I just kept on running
u-until I got here.

428
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:13,416
It must have been a great shock,
mademoiselle.

429
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:18,291
But tell me, the window
where you found the body,

430
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,708
it was at the back
of the library,

431
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,708
overlooking the garden, yes?

432
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,124
Yes.

433
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,124
How was the curtain
on this window?

434
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,708
Shut?

435
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:35,083
No.
It was drawn back.

436
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,833
And on the other windows?

437
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,166
I-I think all the other curtains
were closed.

438
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,416
And this pair of feet,

439
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,958
it was a man or a woman,
would you say?

440
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,499
Oh, a man, I'm sure.

441
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:49,583
Hmm?

442
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,583
Well, they were boots
rather than shoes.

443
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,458
Like hobnail boots,
only very worn and dirty.

444
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,749
I see.

445
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,166
Begging your pardon, sir.

446
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,791
Mrs. Oglander
would like a word with you,

447
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,749
if you wouldn't mind waiting
for a while in the drawing room.

448
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,874
No, no, no.
By all means.

449
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,958
Well, Mlle. Oglander
should have bid three spades,

450
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,666
not one no trump.

451
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,041
Dieu.

452
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,249
There are only 51 cards here.

453
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,208
There is one card missing.

454
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,083
Mon Dieu.
But of course.

455
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,416
Hastings,
this explains everything.

456
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,583
There is no king of clubs.

457
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,458
Thank you very much for waiting,
gentlemen.

458
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,958
Madame.

459
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:46,666
I wonder if I might ask a small
favor of you, Mr. Poirot.

460
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,499
I am at your service, madame.

461
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,166
Well, you see, my husband
is not a well man,

462
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,333
and I'm terrified
that if the newspapers

463
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:58,416
get hold of the fact that
Miss Saintclair is staying here,

464
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:59,874
we shall have no peace.

465
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:04,124
Can I therefore rely
on your discretion, Mr. Poirot?

466
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,291
I have not seen or heard
of Mlle. Saintclair.

467
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,541
You may rest assured, madame.

468
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:14,458
Thank you so much.
I'm so grateful.

469
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,874
May I please ask you something,
madame?

470
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,583
Which of you first noticed
Mlle. Saintclair at the window?

471
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,916
Well, it's difficult
to say, really.

472
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,249
The commotion distracted us all.

473
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,458
But you could see her clearly
from your seat.

474
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,791
Oh, yes, indeed.
I was facing the window.

475
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,041
I was probably engrossed
in the game.

476
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,666
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a dunce
when it comes to bridge.

477
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,166
You're onto something, Poirot.

478
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,708
I'm dashed if I know what.

479
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,541
Patience, my friend.

480
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,874
All right, get him in line.

481
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,166
All right, all right,
none of your half looks.

482
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,708
Just get them off.

483
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,458
This is a serious inquiry.

484
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,124
Get their names on the labels,

485
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:22,374
then give your boots
to the constable.

486
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,291
What?

487
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,416
You'll get them back.
Don't worry.

488
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,374
They're going to be looked at
by a film star.

489
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,083
God help her.

490
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,708
You know, Poirot, there's
a bit more to this modern art

491
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:37,999
than you might think.

492
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,041
It isn't just that they
don't know what they're doing,

493
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,749
even if it might look like it.

494
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,874
This is most unpleasant,
Hastings.

495
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,208
A pal of mine was telling me
that what they're trying to do

496
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,541
is to show all the sides
at the same time

497
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,874
to save us the trouble
of walking 'round the back.

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,291
It's quite a clever idea,
in a way.

499
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,541
I mean, take this fellow,
for instance.

500
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,791
I mean, that bit might be
his front and his back, as well,

501
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,083
if you get my meaning.

502
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,249
It's all quite scientific,
really.

503
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,416
The trouble is,
most of the time,

504
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,166
they're half mad
with booze and drugs,

505
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,624
so what they see
isn't all that reliable.

506
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,374
It's the artistic temperament.
That's the problem.

507
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,541
What have you got there?

508
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:26,041
Oh, Bunny.
What are you doing here?

509
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:28,624
Looking for you and M. Poirot,
actually.

510
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,874
Prince Paul said you'd be here.

511
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,916
What's up?

512
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,374
Well, look,
it may be nothing important.

513
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,166
When I was driving back
from here last night,

514
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,124
I nearly ran straight
into Ralphie Walton

515
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,041
coming the other way.

516
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,374
Swerving around
like some mad dervish, he was.

517
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,999
So you think he was coming here
to see M. Reedburn,

518
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,416
intent on revenge?

519
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,916
I don't know.

520
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:52,124
He certainly didn't look like
a man paying a social visit.

521
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,916
He doesn't wear hobnail boots,
does he?

522
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:56,958
Walton, I mean.

523
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:58,499
Beg pardon, sir.

524
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,749
But there's a telephone call
for Mr. Saunders.

525
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,166
-For me?
-Yes, sir.

526
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,166
Who on earth
could be calling me here?

527
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,749
Excuse me.

528
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,999
So, did Ralph Walton
kill Reedburn?

529
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,791
Ah.

530
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,999
That is the big question,
mon ami.

531
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,999
What about
the missing bridge card?

532
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,041
It is in my pocket.

533
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,541
I don't understand.

534
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,833
Well, there is no great mystery.

535
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,749
The missing card was in the box
all the time.

536
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,916
It had simply not been taken out
with the others.

537
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,291
C'est tout.

538
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:45,583
Well, that was Prince Paul
to say that Ralph Walton

539
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,124
has been taken
to the local cottage hospital.

540
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,249
Crashed his car near here in
the early hours of the morning.

541
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,958
Good heavens.
Is he all right?

542
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:54,166
A broken collarbone
and a hangover.

543
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,749
But he's comfortable,
apparently.

544
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,833
Look, I think I'll trot over to
see the old boy now, all right?

545
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,666
Hastings, why don't you
accompany M. Saunders, eh?

546
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,749
I must return to The Willows,
and I --

547
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,791
Well, I think it best
if I go alone.

548
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,249
Oh. All right.
If you think so.

549
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,541
Besides, you can question
M. Ralph Walton

550
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,083
about last night, perhaps.

551
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,583
Right.

552
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,708
Hop in, then, Arthur.

553
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,708
Right.

554
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,833
Oh, this is nice.

555
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,791
I saw Freddie Dixon
driving one down at the track.

556
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,708
Thought that I'd get one myself.

557
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,124
Twin SU carb, isn't it?

558
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:41,874
Yeah, it's a bit thirsty
but quick.

559
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,374
Morning, sir.

560
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,374
Mr. Poirot.

561
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:36,791
I must apologize for
this unexpected return, madame.

562
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:41,833
I was anxious to fully
set your mind at rest.

563
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,499
You have a second daughter,
madame?

564
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,624
Had.

565
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,874
She died, I'm afraid.

566
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,208
I am sorry to hear you say that.

567
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,124
Hmm.

568
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,999
In my country,
we Belgians have great respect

569
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:08,708
for la mère de famille,
the mother.

570
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,416
She is all-important.

571
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,333
Do not worry.

572
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:18,708
I think it unlikely

573
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,666
that the police
will ever learn the truth.

574
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,749
You will permit me, madame,

575
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:40,124
to return the missing card
to the pack.

576
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,499
To play bridge for over one hour
with only 51 cards,

577
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:56,291
that is not very believable,
madame.

578
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,874
You make one other
small mistake.

579
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,208
You tell me that you're
sitting here facing the window

580
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,458
when Mlle. Saintclair appeared,

581
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:10,041
but your daughter tells me
she also is sitting here,

582
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:13,041
so perhaps you are both sitting
in the same chair, no?

583
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:20,833
Nothing has escaped you,
it seems, Mr. Poirot.

584
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,333
You are feeling better,
mademoiselle?

585
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,333
Yes.
Much better, thank you.

586
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,374
Mademoiselle?

587
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:39,166
I found these in the house
of M. Reedburn.

588
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,666
What have they to do with me?

589
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:52,208
You are a good actress and a
loyal daughter, Mlle. Oglander.

590
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:02,499
This is your father,
M. Oglander, no?

591
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:10,499
And this man, M. Hawtrey,
he is also your father.

592
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,166
You can't be serious.

593
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,666
Mr. Poirot
knows everything, dear.

594
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,458
Believe me, my dear lady, I make
no judgment in this matter.

595
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,666
M. Hawtrey tries
to save his business

596
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,749
with a little false accounting.

597
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,333
Well, fathers have done worse
for the sake of their children.

598
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,499
But M. Hawtrey is caught,

599
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,208
and in his shame,
he changes his name to Oglander.

600
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,916
When your family
come to live here,

601
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,458
Mr. Reedburn
discovers these facts

602
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,499
and tries to blackmail you.

603
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:45,874
Is that not so?

604
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,416
I lived in dread, M. Poirot,

605
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:50,833
that he would
divulge everything.

606
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,458
Paul could never marry me then.

607
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:59,874
I think it is best if you
keep this, mademoiselle.

608
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,499
And have no fear.

609
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:12,541
My lips are sealed.

610
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:33,249
I say, Val,
what are you doing up?

611
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,583
Should be careful -- We just saw
that little French chap

612
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,749
snooping his way back up here.

613
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,333
Vive la famille.

614
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,583
Au revoir, madame.

615
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,083
Like a lift
back to town, Poirot?

616
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:23,041
Ah, well, that is
most kind of you, Inspector,

617
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,958
but I have to meet Captain
Hastings back at Mon Désire.

618
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,583
Ah, yes.

619
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,291
By the by, how'd you get on
at The Willows?

620
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:35,249
Ah, they were nothing of
any interest, I have to admit.

621
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:37,791
What about your Gypsies?

622
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,166
Drawn a blank so far.

623
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,124
Difficult blighters
to deal with.

624
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,791
But we'll find him
sooner or later.

625
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:44,833
Don't you worry.

626
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,166
I admire your persistence,
my friend.

627
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,208
Little gray cells
are all very nice, Poirot,

628
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,791
but it's dogged as does it.

629
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,416
Yes, well, thank you very much,
Inspector.

630
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:59,958
I will try and remember that.
Au revoir.

631
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,291
Ah, Poirot.

632
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,999
How is M. Walton?

633
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,249
Seemed pretty cheerful,
all things considered.

634
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,708
Claims he intended
to give Reedburn a good hiding,

635
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,333
but by the time
he got his courage up,

636
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:47,583
he was in no fit state.

637
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,541
No, no, it does not matter,
Hastings.

638
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,916
The case is closed.

639
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,166
You mean you've caught
the murderer?

640
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,624
There is no murderer.

641
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,749
What?

642
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,624
There is no murderer
because there is no murder.

643
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,624
But Reedburn's body was found
in that window

644
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,374
with a hole in the back
of his head.

645
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,458
Wrong window, Hastings.

646
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,166
This was where the body
lay first.

647
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:10,916
Regard, mon ami.

648
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,624
You see this bloodstain?

649
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,916
Uh-huh?

650
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:18,749
Now, remember,
Chief Inspector Japp said

651
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,041
that there was bruising
on the face of M. Reedburn, huh?

652
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,208
The reason?

653
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,999
Because someone punches him
between the eyes.

654
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,583
M. Reedburn falls backwards,

655
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:34,958
hits his head against this arm,
and slips to the floor.

656
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,124
That is an accident.
It is not murder.

657
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:42,208
But if he fell here,
why did he end up over there?

658
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:45,583
Well, it is not impossible,
you know,

659
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:47,624
to drag the body
across the floor.

660
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,291
But why take it over there?

661
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:51,291
Because it was essential
for their plan.

662
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:52,666
Their plan?

663
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,208
Yes.

664
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:58,499
Valerie Saintclair
and Ronnie Oglander.

665
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:01,791
Well, the father is too ill,
so it had to be the son.

666
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,166
You see, mon ami,

667
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,791
Mlle. Saintclair visited
M. Reedburn last night,

668
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,333
accompanied by Ronnie.

669
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,958
There was a quarrel, no doubt,

670
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:14,333
and the young M. Oglander
punched M. Reedburn in the face.

671
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,624
He fell backwards
and hit his head.

672
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,708
Voilà.

673
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,374
But how do you know all this?

674
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,249
Because of that window.

675
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:26,166
Now, remember,
this was the only window

676
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,291
with its curtains
drawn back, yes?

677
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,166
Why?

678
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:35,874
To give a view of The Willows,
the Oglanders' house.

679
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,833
In order to make it appear

680
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:42,749
that Valerie Saintclair
went to The Willows by chance,

681
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:47,749
it was necessary for the body
to be found over there.

682
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,583
I see.

683
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:53,624
But --

684
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,999
You have another question,
mon ami, no?

685
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,166
Well, yes.

686
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,874
I mean, what's the connection?

687
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:05,458
Between Valerie Saintclair
and the Oglanders?

688
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:07,749
Ah.

689
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,541
What was that Ahmed doing here?

690
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,333
He's come to see to the horses.

691
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,708
Oh.
That's his excuse, is it?

692
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:34,208
He spends too much time hanging
around here, if you ask me.

693
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,874
Oh, Bernard, he doesn't!

694
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,124
I'm still your husband,
Vivienne.

695
00:45:38,709 --> 00:45:41,249
Just don't ever forget that.

696
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,999
Cut.

697
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,208
Excellent.
Bunny, excellent.

698
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:59,374
-Very good, Ralphie.
-Thanks.

699
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:00,666
Oh, darling.

700
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,208
Right, well,
we'll print that one.

701
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:05,208
Now, then, onwards and upwards.

702
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:08,249
We'll move on to scene 64
as long as that one's clear.

703
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:11,208
M. Poirot, have the police made
an arrest?

704
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:14,041
It seems not.

705
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:17,166
And from what I hear,
the trail has gone cold.

706
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,541
Well, the very idea that Val
could have been involved

707
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:22,999
was always preposterous.

708
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,083
Open up the doors
