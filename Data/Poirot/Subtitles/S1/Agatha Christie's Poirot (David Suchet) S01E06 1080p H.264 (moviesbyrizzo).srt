1
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,249
Oh, yes?

2
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,749
And what time do we call this,
then, eh?

3
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,624
I don't want to get you
out of bed.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,041
Here.

5
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,374
No good leaving all this stuff
for 56B.

6
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,208
They're on holiday.

7
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,416
What, all of them?

8
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:34,624
Oh, yeah.

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,166
That Captain Hastings
has gone off shooting things,

10
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:40,291
and the secretary's gone off to
visit her sister in Folkestone.

11
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,624
What about the French one?

12
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,874
Somewhere foreign.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,999
Sent me a postcard
with goats on it.

14
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,708
Oh, yeah, I remember.

15
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,666
Let's hope it keeps fine
for him.

16
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,541
No, no, no, no.

17
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,124
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,874
Please, miss.

19
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,874
Thank you.

20
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,124
Ohh!

21
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,208
Pardon.

22
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,499
Mr. Poirot.

23
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,083
How pleased I am to see you.

24
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:43,624
Mademoiselle...

25
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,999
Lyall.

26
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,749
Pamela Lyall.

27
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,166
I recognized you at the hotel.

28
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:50,458
I'm a great admirer.

29
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:51,499
Ah.

30
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,291
May I cling to you, Mr. Poirot?

31
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:57,249
Yes, it would be a pleasure,
mademoiselle.

32
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:59,291
You are in danger?

33
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:03,041
It's against all my instincts,
but the man persists.

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,291
And with the hotel being
so empty,

35
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,416
there's a great danger
of my getting stuck

36
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,458
for the rest of the holiday.

37
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,958
Ah, the galloping Major Barnes.

38
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,624
Here for the fishing,
he tells me.

39
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:27,041
Ah.

40
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,874
The behavior
of the English abroad

41
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,749
is something
I have always found peculiar.

42
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:48,083
At least he's not
a bottom-pincher, Mr. Poirot.

43
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:59,624
Look at them -- troublemakers,
always looking for a fight.

44
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,166
Perhaps.

45
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,916
But for me, the English
is more cold-blooded.

46
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,999
His violence is more calculated.

47
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,208
We've spent all day at sea,
and my wife's exhausted,

48
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,666
so let's get to the hotel
as fast as possible,

49
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,374
with our luggage intact.

50
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:29,916
Make sure it's secure and stay
close behind the other car.

51
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,666
Excuse me, but aren't these
the cars from the Palace Hotel?

52
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:36,999
Yes. Well?

53
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,499
Well, we're staying there, too,
you know.

54
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,291
Well, you'll have to wait
for them to come back.

55
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,833
The hotel, please, driver.

56
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,791
And try not to hit anything.

57
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,458
Come on, darling.

58
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,791
Thank you.

59
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:08,958
Good heavens,

60
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,541
I do believe
that's Valentine Chantry.

61
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,583
Ah.

62
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,624
Dakers, it was.

63
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,583
I shouldn't think this place
was quite her style --

64
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:21,249
a bit quiet for her.

65
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,624
She's rather marvelous,
isn't she?

66
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,833
Mm.

67
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,333
She has married again?

68
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,083
Number five, I think.

69
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,291
Oh, mon Dieu.

70
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,833
Looks a bit of
a gorilla, doesn't he?

71
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,874
An animal attraction,
would you think, Mr. Poirot?

72
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,583
Well...

73
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:40,666
Well, well, well,
things are looking up.

74
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,916
Hello?

75
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,291
Hello.

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,958
Been looking all over the place
for you, little lady.

77
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:51,874
Not out fishing today, Major?

78
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,208
Yes, earlier.

79
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,749
Didn't have much luck.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,583
Perhaps, Major Barnes, you were
fishing too close to the shore.

81
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,958
I noticed you by the harbor.

82
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,291
I expect you're right.

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,499
Too much damn dynamiting
going on.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,916
Dynamiting?

85
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:10,083
The fishermen drop dynamite
around here.

86
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,166
Damned lazy beggars.

87
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,708
The fish, not being fools,
keep out at sea.

88
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,374
At last.

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,833
Now, will you get
the luggage off immediately

90
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,874
and take it straight
to our rooms?

91
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:48,041
I do not understand
why we weren't met properly.

92
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,499
Well, I think
it's simply wonderful.

93
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,958
It's so unspoiled.

94
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:55,208
Eh, it's pretty enough, but
it's such a long way to come,

95
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,874
such an awful journey.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,249
You'll enjoy bathing
and lazing about.

97
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,416
We could have done that
in Brixen.

98
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,041
Why you wanted to drag us
all this way...

99
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,999
You'll adore it here, I know.

100
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,583
I can see that you mean to enjoy
yourself.

101
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,874
Oh, well.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,249
Give me a bath and a bed,

103
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,458
and perhaps it'll be better
in the morning.

104
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,374
-Tony, darling?
-Yes?

105
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,333
My cigarette case.

106
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,166
She makes me feel
so undercooked.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,291
I'm so patchy still.

108
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:58,458
She really is so lucky.

109
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:04,833
Oh, dear, that bathing dress
is a mistake.

110
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:09,833
Morning.

111
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,499
Good morning.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,874
Lovely day.

113
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,041
Shall I put yours here, darling?

114
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,333
Yes, so I can get
a little bit of sun.

115
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,541
I feel so dreadfully faded,

116
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,749
but I freckle
rather than going brown.

117
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,958
Have you ever been to Rhodes
before?

118
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,208
No. It's lovely, isn't it?

119
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,458
Such a clever idea of yours,
darling.

120
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,999
Scarcely heard of the place.

121
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,541
I thought it was Greek, maybe,
or Turkish.

122
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:41,999
No idea it was Itai.

123
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,874
If it were only nearer England.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,999
Did you come from Brindisi?

125
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:49,999
Yes, came on the ferry
last night.

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,041
The sea
is simply lovely, so blue.

127
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,708
I think we ought to go in now,
Douglas, don't you?

128
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,166
Oh, yes, rather.

129
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,583
Uh, in a minute.

130
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,124
Just pull that towel a little
flatter, would you, darling?

131
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,041
Tony, darling, would you mind?

132
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,083
What's that?

133
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,333
I've left a little pot of
face cream in the bathing cart.

134
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,249
I meant to bring it with me.

135
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,541
Do get it for me.
There's an angel.

136
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:38,791
Yes, darling.

137
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,999
He must be crazy about her.
Wouldn't you say?

138
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,916
It's lovely, Douglas, so warm!

139
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,041
Do come!

140
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,791
Aren't you going in?

141
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,124
Oh, I, uh -- I like to get
well hotted up first.

142
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,166
I like my dip last thing.

143
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,833
Oh, dear, I can't get this thing
undone.

144
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,124
I'm hopeless.
I...

145
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,208
Um, I wonder -- would you...

146
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,291
Can I do it for you?

147
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,999
Oh, thank you.
You are kind.

148
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,833
I'm such a fool
at undoing things.

149
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,374
Oh, you are a clever boy.

150
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,333
You've done it.

151
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,124
We must have been
on the same ferry.

152
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,499
Mm.

153
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,374
It's Douglas, isn't it?

154
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,416
Yes. Douglas Gold.

155
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,624
Darling, Douglas has just been
so kind to me.

156
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:56,999
My husband, Tony.

157
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,374
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

158
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,999
And your wife's called?

159
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,791
Marjorie.

160
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:02,958
Yes.

161
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,416
Don't you think
that human beings

162
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,499
tend to reproduce
certain patterns, Mr. Poirot?

163
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,291
Stereotyped patterns?

164
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,041
Précisément, mademoiselle.

165
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,166
Your wife's not with you
this afternoon, Douglas?

166
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,666
No, uh, Marjorie wasn't feeling
too well.

167
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,874
Probably too much sun
this morning.

168
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,291
So I came alone.

169
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,833
Ah.

170
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,124
Well, we'll just have to make
the best of it on our own.

171
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,416
Ah.

172
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:11,999
Mme. Gold.

173
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,041
Mr. Poirot.

174
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,916
Hello. I was noticing
this particular detail --

175
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,749
they have some freshwater
and seawater poison.

176
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,374
-Fascinating.
-Yes.

177
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,124
And what a beautiful day.

178
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,166
Ah.

179
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,458
Douglas and I are always lucky
in our weather.

180
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:29,916
You do not bathe this afternoon,
madame?

181
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,124
No, only once a day.

182
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,708
We'd arranged to go on a tour
of the old city this afternoon,

183
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,041
but somehow or other
we missed each other.

184
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,833
Indeed?

185
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,791
You know, Mr. Poirot,

186
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,499
when one sees so much trouble
and unhappiness

187
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,208
and so many couples divorcing
each other

188
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,833
and that sort of thing,

189
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,041
one does feel very grateful
for one's own happiness.

190
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,708
It is pleasant to hear you
say so, madame.

191
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,041
That's why I feel so sorry
for people who aren't happy.

192
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,083
Mrs. Chantry, for instance.

193
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,749
Mme. Chantry?

194
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,749
In a way,
one feels sorry for her.

195
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,124
I mean, in spite of all
her money and good looks,

196
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,499
she's the sort of woman,
I think,

197
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,666
that men would get tired of
very easily.

198
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,666
Don't you think so?

199
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,791
Men are just like children.

200
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,333
They believe anything.

201
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,791
I gather you are a detective,
Mr. Poirot.

202
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,208
Well...

203
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,999
How long are you in Rhodes?

204
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,833
Sadly, madame,
I leave on Saturday.

205
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,708
Douglas, a pink gin.

206
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,083
I positively must have
a pink gin.

207
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,624
Have a nice bathe, Tony,
darling?

208
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,208
Hasn't it been a marvelous day,
Miss Lyall?

209
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,999
Oh.

210
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,583
Tony?

211
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:22,749
Good afternoon.

212
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,249
Shall we wander over there?

213
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:30,958
Mm.

214
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,333
Valentine certainly has
her methods.

215
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,999
Mademoiselle,
I do not like all this.

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,249
Don't you?
Nor do I.

217
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,958
No, let's be honest.

218
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,499
I suppose I do like it, really.

219
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:57,541
In fact, I've arranged
a little excursion for tomorrow.

220
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,291
Two hours of driving
and all this ludicrous climbing,

221
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,291
and all there is at the top
is another ruin.

222
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,833
But wait till you see the view.

223
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,499
Ah.

224
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,624
I say.

225
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,666
C'est magnifique.

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,416
Here it is!

227
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,416
Look.
Look -- a snake!

228
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,499
How beautiful.

229
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,124
Well, be careful.

230
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,333
I don't like it here.
I think we should go back.

231
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,666
Damn place.

232
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,124
It isn't safe to walk in.

233
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,083
They're everywhere.

234
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:40,541
In the old days, Rhodes was
known as the "island of snakes."

235
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,624
You can see the markings
so clearly.

236
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,999
Mm -- as a warning, madame.

237
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,708
Nature gives to the quarry
of the viper

238
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,958
a chance to identify
his attacker.

239
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,249
If every killer was
as clearly marked,

240
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,166
I would be without a job.

241
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,583
Do we have to have this?

242
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,624
We can't hear ourselves speak.

243
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:31,124
Let us not be disrespectful
of the local customs, Commander.

244
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,083
I can't understand
a word of this menu.

245
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,749
Well, take mine.
This one's got some English.

246
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,833
Translation's a bit rough,
though.

247
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,208
Is this wine?

248
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,791
Looks like pink gin.

249
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,916
I think it's terrible.

250
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,166
People are doing it
all the time.

251
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,999
Well, I belong to
the old-fashioned generation

252
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,124
that doesn't believe in divorce.

253
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,416
The sort of attitude there is
to life nowadays

254
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,624
that if you do a thing
and you don't like it,

255
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,083
you get yourself out of it
as quickly as possible --

256
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:10,458
easy marriage, easy divorce --
I hate that.

257
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:19,624
You seem to know a great deal
about marriage, Mrs. Gold.

258
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:23,708
I-I-I --

260
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,291
It strikes me
you've been listening

261
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,583
to far too many scandalmongers.

262
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,249
Just because a woman
is good-looking,

263
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,124
people come down on her
like a ton of bricks.

264
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,749
Oh, but I didn't mean --

265
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,541
Oh, dear!

266
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,624
Marjorie?

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,083
There was no need for that!

268
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,374
Yes, well, I can't imagine

269
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,874
why you brought your wife
on holiday, anyway, Gold.

270
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,916
What do you mean?

271
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,666
Because you only have eyes
for Valentine.

272
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,041
Don't be ridiculous.
You must be drunk.

273
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,208
If you and my wife think
you can put this one over on me,

274
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,833
you're very much mistaken.

275
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,833
I'll not be got rid of
as easily as all that.

276
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,749
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to order now?

277
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,583
Ah. Very good.

278
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,541
The "bowels in spit" --

279
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,958
I have your assurance it is
the kidneys of a lamb,

280
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,249
but on a skewer, yes?

281
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,958
Ah, c'est parfait.

282
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,083
Then, for me, the bowels
in spit, efharisto.

283
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:50,333
Oh, Mr. Poirot.

284
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,666
Forgive me -- I thought
I might be alone here.

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,999
May I give you some advice,
madame?

286
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,166
Oh, yes, yes, please.

287
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,791
Bien.

288
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,041
Your husband loves you.
I know it.

289
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,624
How can you know it?

290
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,749
She's got hold of him,
body and soul.

291
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,833
He doesn't think of me anymore.
I don't count.

292
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,291
Oh, I can't bear it.

293
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,333
I can't bear it.

294
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,708
Then my advice to you, madame,
is this --

295
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,999
Leave this place
before it is too late.

296
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,833
Too late?

297
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,208
What do you mean?

298
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,958
You're frightening me.

299
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,749
Yes.

300
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,333
That is my intention.

301
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,583
But why?

302
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,958
Why?

303
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,166
It is my advice to you.

304
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:45,458
Leave this island
if you value your life.

305
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,416
Merci.

306
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,749
We'll be sorry to see you go,
M. Poirot.

307
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,124
Your tickets are with
the passport.

308
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,291
And my reservation --
it has been confirmed?

309
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,499
A sleeping berth
on the night boat.

310
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,166
Merci.

311
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,749
Oh, will you be taking
dinner tonight?

312
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,166
Um... yes, something
light before I travel.

313
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,874
Major Barnes has provided
the kitchen with some barbouni.

314
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:26,041
Ah.

315
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:30,041
The red mullet would be ideal.
Merci.

316
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,124
Catch them unawares first thing
in the morning.

317
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,999
No, no, no, no, no.
Mon Dieu.

318
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,416
No, please! Aah!

319
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,499
With care, with care.

320
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,916
Regardez. Regardez.
Look. Look. Look.

321
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,958
Là.

322
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,958
Les autres ici.
The others here.

323
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,249
Of course it's all lies,
but he's infatuated.

324
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,083
He says he wants a divorce.

325
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:12,583
I don't know what to do.

326
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,624
It's terrible.

327
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,749
Mademoiselle.

328
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,833
It's such a shame
you're leaving, Mr. Poirot.

329
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,249
I don't know how you can
when things are just hotting up.

330
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,583
The Chantrys and the Golds

331
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,874
are getting into
more and more of a pickle.

332
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,499
It's all rather shocking.

333
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,708
Marjorie thinks that Valentine
will divorce Chantry

334
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,499
and marry Douglas.

335
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,249
Really?

336
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,499
Look -- they're over there.

337
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,291
I can't see Chantry giving up
without a fight.

338
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,291
Who could have predicted
such passion, Mr. Poirot?

339
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:01,166
There is a crisis of the nerves,
certainly.

340
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,541
Look.

341
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:06,333
Hello.

342
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,708
This is a bit silly, isn't it?

343
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:11,291
I quite agree -- pointless,
spoiling the whole picture show.

344
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,333
Quite my feelings exactly.

345
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,249
Shall we, uh, go in together?

346
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,374
Oh, dear.

347
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,333
I was half hoping there'd be
a murder so you'd stay.

348
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:25,666
Mm.

349
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,083
Garçon?

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,083
Why don't you take a picture
of us two?

351
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,124
Oh, all right.

352
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,166
And then we'll...

353
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:47,708
The button is on the side.

354
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,833
-We'll just line up.
-All right.

355
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,666
How's that? How's that?

356
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:57,541
Jolly good shot.

357
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,208
The ladies have gone off
on an evening drive --

358
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,874
something of a reconciliation,
I gather.

359
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,916
Ah.

360
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,666
Well, there's been too much
bad temper and bickering.

361
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,041
Indeed.

362
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,083
Sorry you're leaving, Poirot.

363
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,583
Not had much time for a chat.

364
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,958
Well, you've been very busy,
Major, eh?

365
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:18,124
The mullet was excellent.

366
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,249
Oh, glad you enjoyed it.

367
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,208
Oh, yes.
Where did you buy it?

368
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,208
What do you mean?

369
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,208
I had to go a long way out
for that.

370
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,208
No, no, no, no, Major.

371
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,499
Your interests
are closer to the shore.

372
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,541
My car, please.

373
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,999
Certainly, M. Poirot.

374
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,791
The Italians, I notice,

375
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,583
are strengthening their harbor
defenses for military use?

376
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,833
You're very sharp-eyed,
Mr. Poirot.

377
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,583
Mm.

378
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:56,124
The sharp eyes are important
in both our professions, Major.

379
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,416
-Efharisto.
-Merci.

380
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:24,624
Well done.

381
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,958
Well done, Douglas.

382
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,374
Thank you.
Shall I?

383
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,874
Have a good game, gentlemen?

384
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,333
Capital.

385
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,333
Fellow's too good to me --
ran out with a break of 46.

386
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,874
Pure fluke, I assure you.

387
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:42,416
What'll you have?

388
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,791
A pink gin, please.

389
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,833
And you, Major?
This one's on me.

390
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,916
Very kind of you.
I'll have a whiskey and soda.

391
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,708
And two whiskey and sodas.

392
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:04,791
My bags, parakaló.

393
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,624
I've worked pretty hard
all my life, you know --

394
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,916
no time for holidays.

395
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,083
Don't get me wrong.

396
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:17,041
I've seen a bit of life these
past few years, I can tell you.

397
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,083
Excuse me, Major.

398
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,458
Tony, darling, it's too divine,

399
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,833
the most marvelous idea
of Mrs. Gold's.

400
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,458
You all ought to have come.

401
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:29,041
Where have you been, darling?

402
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,499
Up to the Temple of Apollo
to see the sunset.

403
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,874
There's the most marvelous view,
darling, right across to Turkey.

404
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,166
We must go tomorrow.

405
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,624
Sounds like a good idea.

406
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,249
Miss Lyall, what'll you have?

407
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,999
Oh, thanks -- a sidecar, please.

408
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,166
Darling?

409
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:43,416
Pink gin.

410
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,708
Oh, have that one.

411
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,083
I'll order another.

412
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:47,124
Ooh, rather.

413
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,249
Mrs. Gold?

414
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,833
Orangeade, please.

415
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,916
Barman, could we have a sidecar
and a pink gin and --

416
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,583
Ooh, I needed that.

417
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,916
Are you sure you wouldn't like
something stronger, Mrs. Gold?

418
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,249
Oh, all right, then --
gin and ginger beer, please.

419
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,416
Darling!

420
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,458
Well, it feels like
a celebration.

421
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,874
Right you are, then --
gin and ginger beer it is.

422
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,083
Barman?

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,249
Yes, monsieur?

424
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,666
Would you mind stepping
over here, please, sir?

425
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,624
Oh, Miss Lyall.

426
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:03,041
What I've been meaning to say
all the time we've been here

427
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:06,499
is that your clothes are so
clever -- such a marvelous line.

428
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,208
Are you all right?

429
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,874
What's the matter?

430
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,666
I need a drink of some water.

431
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:12,999
Oh.

432
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,041
Waiter?

433
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,041
I f-- I feel rather queer.

434
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,499
Something gone down
the wrong way?

435
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,541
I can't --
I can't get my breath.

436
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:26,124
Oh.

437
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,666
Waiter, parakaló --
quickly, some water.

438
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:29,708
What's up?

439
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,166
Commander Chantry!

440
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:32,708
What's the matter, Val?

441
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,749
I don't know.

442
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,541
That drink tasted queer.

443
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,249
The pink gin? This?

444
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,833
Give her some room.

445
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,416
Drink this, Val.

446
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,499
Try to drink this.

447
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,666
Who knows what to do?

448
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,166
I'll get a doctor.

449
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,416
That was my drink, Gold.
I'd not touched it.

450
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:03,333
What the hell did you put in it?

451
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:34,124
She's dead.

452
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,291
You killed her.

453
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,583
You meant to kill me,
but you killed her.

454
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,624
I'll see you hang for this,
Gold.

455
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,583
I'll see you hang for this.

456
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:54,083
I-I -- I didn't do anything.

457
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,833
I have told you again and again!

458
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:33,916
I am on holiday!

459
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,791
I am a Belgian citizen!

460
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,749
You have no right to detain me!

461
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,916
You are not to leave this island

462
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:45,374
until you explain all movement
exactly.

463
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,541
How can I leave this island
now?!

464
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,541
My ship has gone, you idiot!

465
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,166
Mlle. Lyall!

466
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,958
What is the matter?

467
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,458
What are you doing here?

468
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,999
Mr. Poirot, thank God.

469
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,624
I thought you'd left.

470
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,291
You must come quickly.

471
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,833
Valentine Chantry is dead.

472
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,749
Ah.

473
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,416
Someone poisoned
her husband's glass,

474
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,041
and she drank it.

475
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,208
I feared such an outcome.

476
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,249
Then why didn't you do
something?

477
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,583
Do what?

478
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,416
What is there to do
before the event?

479
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,583
Tell the police that someone
has murder in their heart?

480
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,374
No.

481
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,333
I will come.

482
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,874
And now, monsieur, I have more
pressing matters to attend to.

483
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:36,666
I am a detective, not a spy.

484
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:45,458
Kindly send my bags
to the hotel Palazzo di Rodi.

485
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,416
Oh, I was attracted to her.

486
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,374
Who wouldn't be?

487
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,291
It was within the bounds
of propriety, Poirot.

488
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:18,916
Ah.

489
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,374
Did she confide in you?

490
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,041
A little.

491
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:27,708
Was Valentine Chantry
a happy woman, would you say?

492
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,374
In her marriage, you mean?

493
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,249
She was rather lost and afraid.

494
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,749
Afraid of what?

495
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,791
Of Chantry.

496
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:36,999
Ah.

497
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,208
She thought he was jealous.

498
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:39,374
Of you?

499
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,583
Of anyone who paid attention
to her.

500
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,624
She was so helpless
in many ways, Poirot.

501
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,416
I-I felt protective towards her.

502
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,874
But somehow everything got
out of hand --

503
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,166
Chantry behaving like a bull
at a gate,

504
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,041
then Marjorie
getting hysterical.

505
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,166
M. Gold...

506
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,791
do you love your wife?

507
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:07,833
Of course I do.

508
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,749
She's all the whole world to me.

509
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,374
You are a Catholic?

510
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,041
Yes.

511
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:27,124
Your faith will be
a great consolation to you.

512
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,791
Poirot --

513
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:45,124
Poirot, they'll --
they'll hang me for this.

514
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,041
Not while I have the power
to prevent it, monsieur.

515
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:05,791
...due, uno, due, uno, due...

516
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:08,958
The poison was contained
in the empty bottle,

517
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,499
which we discovered in
Mr. Gold's dinner-jacket pocket.

518
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,999
It is safe to touch.

519
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,291
The only fingerprints on it
were Douglas Gold's.

520
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,833
Mrs. Chantry was
a very beautiful woman.

521
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,291
A public affair was taking place
between her and Douglas Gold,

522
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,999
but Commander Chantry was
a very possessive husband.

523
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,374
He would not relinquish
his wife.

524
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,124
The lover poisons
the husband's glass,

525
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,333
and then, just when
his attention is elsewhere,

526
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,499
the wife drinks it instead.

527
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,791
Ecco!

528
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:47,541
Oh, it is a scene worthy
of the Italian opera, Inspector.

529
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,958
I assume that you asked
Douglas Gold

530
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,124
to empty the contents
of his pockets himself?

531
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,166
Yes.

532
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,333
Hmm.

533
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,999
Then it is hardly surprising

534
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:03,874
that his fingerprints should be
found on the container, is it?

535
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,208
Do you not find it peculiar,
Inspector,

536
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,916
that this calculating murderer
should be discovered

537
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,958
with this very bottle of poison
in his pocket?

538
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,166
There is no doubt, signor.

539
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,541
When the cold-blooded Englishman
comes out into the sun,

540
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,208
perhaps it warms his passion.

541
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:26,333
Ah, basta!

542
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,208
But M. Gold does not admit
his guilt.

543
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:39,083
On the contrary --
he protests his innocence.

544
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:42,333
Just because the wrong person
died, that is no defense.

545
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,791
What do you mean,
I can't pick up my passport?

546
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:56,041
They are my express instructions
from the police, Commander.

547
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,499
I want my wife's body given
a decent burial back in England,

548
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,416
not in some outpost
of the Italian empire.

549
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,124
Now, there's a ship leaving
this afternoon,

550
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,624
and there's going to be a hell
of a stink if I'm not on it.

551
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,583
Commander Chantry.

552
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,874
There is no recompense I can
make for the loss of your wife,

553
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,249
nothing I can say to you
that's adequate,

554
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,291
only that I have lost a husband.

555
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,124
Oh, Mr. Poirot, if only we had
taken your advice.

556
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,208
Advice?
What advice?

557
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,458
Mr. Poirot recommended that we
leave the island some days ago.

558
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,666
Then I wish you'd warned me
also, Mr. Poirot.

559
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:42,958
Ah.

560
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,874
You are going to visit
your husband, madame?

561
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,916
Yes.

562
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:50,916
Then believe me when I tell you
that he is innocent.

563
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,458
And you may rest assured
that he will soon be released.

564
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,958
Excuse me.

565
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,833
If you please,
one tisane on the terrace.

566
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:10,083
Merci.

567
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,624
What's going off, Poirot?

568
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,166
You make all these
confounded mysteries,

569
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,041
and it's useless asking you
to explain.

570
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,874
I have told you --
Douglas Gold is innocent.

571
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,583
But that means that one of us
poisoned the glass.

572
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,749
Indeed.

573
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,333
Merci.

574
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,499
And we shall know who

575
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,124
when we know from where
the poison came.

576
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,833
But there we have the problem,
eh?

577
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:01,208
The police will not allow me
any further facilities.

578
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,541
For them,
the case is dried and cut.

579
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:07,666
Then... I may be able
to help you.

580
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,833
I trust I may speak
among friends?

581
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:14,958
Mm.

582
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:17,541
The forensic officer
is a friend of mine.

583
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:22,458
You understand, Mr. Poirot, this
is a matter of extreme delicacy.

584
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,833
Mais oui.

585
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,291
Came out here on holiday,
M. Poirot,

586
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,708
fell in love with the place.

587
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,708
You have examined the poison,
monsieur?

588
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,458
Yes, it's local --
Rhodian, very old remedy.

589
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,458
The Knights of St. John
were hospitables

590
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:54,708
before they were warriors.

591
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:55,958
It's one of their potions,

592
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:58,874
medicinal in its diluted form,
lethal when neat.

593
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,124
A snake bite.

594
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,208
It's from the fangs
of the horned viper.

595
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,583
The island's still full
of superstition.

596
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,666
It's called vilitilio occius.

597
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,958
Where would such a poison
be obtained?

598
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,041
Not on the shelves
of a pharmacist.

599
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:23,791
Some herbalist or quack.

600
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:28,374
If you really wanted to search,
try the streets around here.

601
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:41,708
Blackshirts.

602
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,666
There are so many streets.

603
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,916
Where do we begin?

604
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:53,583
Mademoiselle, we must now appear

605
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,541
the mad English
who go out in the midday sun.

606
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:04,666
And we must trust in the old
town to give up her secrets.

607
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,833
Come.

608
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,583
Ah.

609
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,791
Parakaló -- vilitilio occius?

610
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,374
Vilitilio occius?

611
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,208
Efharisto.

612
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,374
Vilitilio occius?

613
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,208
Parakaló -- vilitilio occius?

614
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,708
Efharisto.

615
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:19,874
Parakaló.

616
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,041
Vilitilio occius?

617
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,541
Efharisto.

618
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:47,958
It will be all right.

619
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:56,208
Yiayia!

620
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,999
No, no, you don't understand.

621
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,333
I don't want to buy some poison.

622
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:51,083
I want to know if you sold
any to someone else.

623
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,833
Yesterday or the day before.

624
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:17,916
Anglos?

625
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,291
Tall?

626
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:21,791
Megalos?

627
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,333
And his hair --
was it like mine or darker?

628
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,416
Not men -- lady.

629
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:50,999
Yes, English lady.

630
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,083
Poirot, the poison was sold
to Mrs. Gold.

631
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:58,083
Of course.

632
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,499
So, you comprehend?

633
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:05,041
But whyever did she want to help
her husband poison Chantry?

634
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,249
Ah, my dear Mlle. Pamela,

635
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:09,999
it is not a question

636
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,583
of who failed to murder
the Commander Chantry,

637
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,499
but who --
and for what reason --

638
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,166
succeeded in murdering his wife.

639
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,249
A disturbance?

640
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:36,291
Yes, the passports were stolen.

641
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,541
He was distracted by a scream.

642
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,958
Mrs. Gold was disturbed.

643
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,708
A mantis flew in
and settled on a pillow.

644
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,083
After last night's terrible
events, he left the desk.

645
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,833
Is Commander Chantry
still in the hotel?

646
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,416
Bien.

647
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,999
Marjorie Gold and Chantry?

648
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:05,208
Oh, yes, Mlle. Pamela --
the eternal triangle.

649
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:06,583
You remember?

650
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,333
But not the one
that you were supposed to see.

651
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:13,041
It was only the reactions
of Mme. Gold

652
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:16,499
and the jealous blusters
of the Commander Chantry

653
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:19,708
that made you think
that Douglas Gold was in love

654
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,583
with the Commander's wife,
Valentine Chantry.

655
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,499
Oh, yes, it was skillfully done.

656
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:27,999
You see, Marjorie Gold
and the Commander Chantry

657
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,791
had started their affair
in England.

658
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:34,291
They planned to meet here
and stage their crime publicly.

659
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,041
Chantry inserted the poison
into his own drink

660
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:39,499
and passed it to his wife.

661
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,958
She drank it, and then,
in the confusion,

662
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,749
he slipped the bottle of poison
into the pocket of Douglas Gold.

663
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:48,958
How awful.

664
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,541
But now we must stop them before
they can leave the island.

665
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:56,749
Already they have obtained
their passports.

666
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,208
I will check the boat
from Brindisi.

667
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,833
You ask if anyone has seen them.

668
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,208
Excuse me.

669
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:11,124
Are there English people
on board?

670
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,374
-English people?
-No, no, no, sorry.

671
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,166
Brindisi?

672
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,541
-Grazie.
-Prego.

673
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,166
Major Barnes!

674
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:37,833
Ah.

675
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:44,541
I have to keep up appearances,
Poirot.

676
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,791
The swordfish is five days old.

677
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:51,624
It's not the Italians
I've been keeping an eye on.

678
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,083
It's the English.

679
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,541
Commander Chantry
has taken to fishing.

680
00:47:55,792 --> 00:48:00,291
He and Mrs. Gold are heading out
to the Turkish coast.

681
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:07,874
When did you first realize
about Mrs. Gold?

682
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:12,458
Her performance was without
fault, except in one particular.

683
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,583
Poirot! Ahead!

684
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:23,416
That scene she created
at the cabana --

685
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:26,666
she suggested that her husband
wanted a divorce.

686
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:30,916
Eh bien -- I had just observed
that M. Gold was a Catholic.

687
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,416
The whole thing
did not make sense,

688
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,249
unless of course we were
watching the elaborate charade.

689
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,124
Tony, look -- a boat!

690
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,249
Could he be armed, Poirot?

691
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:45,416
I do not think they would dare
risk bringing the gun

692
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:46,708
onto the island.

693
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:48,499
Their method is more discreet.

694
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,541
And I can deal
with the commander.

695
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:56,916
That bloody Belgian busybody!

696
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,083
Can't you make it go faster?

697
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,416
Faster! Faster!

698
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:04,666
Dynamite?

699
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:06,666
Yes, dynamite --
get the dynamite.

700
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,124
Get away the boat fast!

701
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:09,874
-What is it?
-What is it?

702
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,708
He's got some dynamite!

703
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,083
Keep away!
Keep away!

704
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:18,499
Commander Chantry, drop the
dynamite, or we shall fire!

705
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,041
Stand off!
Stand off!

706
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,583
Ah, mon Dieu.

707
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,499
-Is he all right?
-You crazy English!

708
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,458
If you do not stop
trying to kill each other,

709
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:31,124
I shall put you all
under arrest!

710
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:36,958
That includes you,
Signor Poirot!

711
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:49,624
Poor Douglas Gold.

712
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,374
He's staying on, you know,
to the end.

713
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,791
Well, he should leave.

714
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:04,666
I told his wife to leave,
but she took no notice.

715
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,999
Can't you stay on
a few more days?

716
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,333
Impossible.

717
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,791
Je regrette.

718
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,458
No, no.

719
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,041
I really enjoyed
our little adventure.

720
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,083
Ah.

721
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:29,458
Ah, Poirot, trying to sneak off
the island again, are you?

722
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:31,958
Not at all, Major, not at all.

723
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:33,416
I thought I should leave

724
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:35,791
before the inspector changes
his mind, eh?

725
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,833
Look, if you see me
at the harbor,

726
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,291
pretend you don't know me.

727
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,666
Ah.

728
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,208
Where are you headed, Major?
Abyssinia?

729
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:46,083
How the Hades did you know that?

730
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,999
Well, I, uh -- I assumed
you'd want to be there

731
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,624
for the ostrich-shooting season.

732
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,583
Au revoir.

733
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,291
Goodbye, M. Poirot.

734
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:15,791
Oh.

735
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:20,583
I hope we shall meet again.

736
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:26,041
Au revoir, mademoiselle.
