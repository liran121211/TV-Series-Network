1
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,333
"Husband put head
in gas oven. Home life happy."?

2
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,708
No.

3
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,166
"Belgravia and
Overseas Bank clerk absconds

4
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,541
with fortune"?

5
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,458
How much is this fortune?

6
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,083
£90,000.

7
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:49,583
No.

8
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,541
That's a king's ransom, Poirot.

9
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,458
When it is used to ransom
a king,

10
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,458
it becomes interesting
to Poirot.

11
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,999
"Missed typist of 21.
Where is Edna Field?"

12
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,124
Oh, no.

13
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,791
There's good stuff
here, Poirot.

14
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,999
Mysterious suicide, absconding
bank clerk, missing typist.

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,833
Yes, but I am not greatly
attracted to any of them,

16
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,083
mon ami.

17
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,499
I have many affairs
of importance of my own

18
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,499
to attend to.

19
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,833
Such as?

20
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,541
My wardrobe, Hastings.

21
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,499
If I mistake not, there is on my
new gray suit a spot of grease.

22
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,541
You have noticed it perhaps,
non?

23
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,666
No.

24
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,583
No? Well, it is only
the one spot, you understand,

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,749
but it is sufficient
to trouble me.

26
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,541
Then there's my winter overcoat.

27
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,333
I must lay him aside
in the parlor of kittings.

28
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,708
And I think. . .

29
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,249
yes, I think the moment is right

30
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,374
for the trimming
of the mustache,

31
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,083
also the pomading.

32
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,666
There's a lady to see you,
Mr. Poirot.

33
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,624
A lady?

34
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,791
A client.
Her name's Mrs. Todd.

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,541
Unless the affair
is one of national importance,

36
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,166
I touch it not.

37
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,416
I couldn't say, sir.
Shall I ask her?

38
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,999
No, no, no, no, Miss Lemon.

39
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:09,916
Show Mrs. Todd in.

40
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,374
We shall judge for ourselves,
eh, Hastings?

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,208
Oh, yes, yes.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,208
Mrs. Todd.

43
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,624
Doesn't sound as if
she's nationally important.

44
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
Mind you,
I knew a Mrs. Jones once

45
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,291
who was Master of Hounds
with the Mid Rutland.

46
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,666
Yes?

47
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,708
No, that's all.
Funny woman.

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,749
Mrs. Todd, sir.

49
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,749
Thank you.

50
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,416
Oh, are you Mr. Poirot?

51
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,999
I am Hercule Poirot,
yes, madame.

52
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,416
Oh, you're not a bit
how I thought you'd be.

53
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,583
Did you pay for that bit
in the paper

54
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,208
saying what a clever detective
you were,

55
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,208
or did they put it in
themselves?

56
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,791
Madame.

57
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,791
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sure,

58
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,291
but you know what newspapers
are like nowadays.

59
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,624
Nothing but puff.

60
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,208
But no offense taken, I hope.

61
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,666
I'll tell you what I want you
to do for me.

62
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,208
I want you to find my cook.

63
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:12,583
I fear you are making a mistake,
madame.

64
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,708
Hercule Poirot
is a private detective.

65
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,708
I know that.

66
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,583
Haven't I just told you I want
you to find my cook for me?

67
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,291
Walked out of the house
on Wednesday,

68
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,208
without so much
as a "by your leave,"

69
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:25,624
and never came back.

70
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,999
I am sorry, madame,

71
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,041
but I do not touch that
particular kind of business.

72
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,874
I wish you good day.

73
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,708
So, that's it, is it?

74
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,833
Too proud, eh?

75
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,249
Only deal with government
secrets and countesses' jewels?

76
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,166
Well, let me tell you,
Mr. High and Mighty Poirot,

77
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,958
a good cook is a good cook,
and when you lose one,

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,749
it's as much to you
as pearls are to some fine lady.

79
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,916
Madame, you are in the right,
and I am in the wrong.

80
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,833
Your remarks are just
and intelligent.

81
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,958
This case will be a novelty,
Hastings.

82
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,916
Never before have we hunted
a missing domestique.

83
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,249
Truly, here is the problem
of national importance.

84
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,541
Where do you reside, Mrs. Todd?

85
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,624
88 Prince Albert Road, Clapham.

86
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,333
You say this jewel
of a cook went out on Wednesday

87
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,583
and did not return?

88
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,541
Wednesday, yes.
It was her day off.

89
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,916
The day before yesterday.

90
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,499
Has it occurred to you, madame,

91
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,833
that she might have met
with some accident?

92
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,833
Have you inquired
at the hospitals?

93
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,124
That's exactly what I thought
yesterday,

94
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,041
but this morning, if you please,
she sent for her box.

95
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,541
-What box?
-Her box.

96
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,166
Her trunk.

97
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,916
Luggage.

98
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,416
Oh, I see.

99
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,916
Will you describe her to me,
madame?

100
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:02,833
Oh, she's most respectable.

101
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,583
Ten years in her last place.

102
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,708
Middle-aged, gray-haired, thin.

103
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,083
And her name?

104
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,541
Dunn.
Eliza Dunn.

105
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,083
This is Clapham.

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,541
There's the common.

107
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,124
Charming.

108
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,291
You had no disagreement with her
on Wednesday, madame?

109
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,541
No, that's what makes it all
so queer.

110
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,791
How many servants do you keep?

111
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,041
Two.

112
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:34,458
Miss Dunn and the house
parlor maid, Annie.

113
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,999
There we are.

114
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,416
There's 88.

115
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,124
All right, driver!

116
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,708
Annie!

117
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,041
Hastings, my friend,
promise me one thing.

118
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,333
What's that, Poirot?

119
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,208
Never, but never
must Chief Inspector Japp hear

120
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:16,874
that I investigated such a case.

121
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,541
Mum's the word, old boy.

122
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,749
Now, Annie,
this gentleman's a detective.

123
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,416
He wants to ask you
a few questions.

124
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,291
Here we are, sir.

125
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,541
Voyons, Mademoiselle Annie.

126
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,374
Sit yourself.

127
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,249
Thank you, sir.

128
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,791
All that you shall tell us

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,458
will be of the greatest
importance, Annie.

130
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,874
You alone can shed any light
on the case.

131
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,541
Without you, I can do nothing.

132
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,999
Oh, sir, I'm sure I'll tell you
anything I can, sir.

133
00:08:58,584 --> 00:08:59,833
That is good.

134
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,874
Now.

135
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,333
First of all. . .

136
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,166
what is your own idea?

137
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,499
You are a girl
of remarkable intelligence.

138
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,874
That can be seen at once,
but this is a queer thing, hein?

139
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,374
What is your own explanation
of Eliza's disappearance?

140
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,999
White slavers, sir.

141
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,874
Ah.

142
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,583
I've said so all along, sir,
only no one will listen.

143
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Cook was always warning me
against them.

144
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,958
"Don't you go sniffing no scent
nor eating no sweets,

145
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,874
no matter how gentlemanly
the fellow."

146
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,958
This is something we have not
thought of, Hastings.

147
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,333
No, right.

148
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,708
Good heavens.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,124
But would she have sent
for her trunk?

150
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,041
Beg pardon, sir?

151
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,416
Miss Dunn sent for her trunk,
I believe.

152
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:56,333
Now, if she had truly been taken
by these white slavers,

153
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,541
would she have sent
for her luggage?

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,666
Well, I don't know, sir.

155
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,333
She'd want her things,
wouldn't she?

156
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,749
Even in foreign parts,
she'd want her things.

157
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,583
Who came for her trunk, Annie?

158
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,041
The carriers, sir,
the men from Carter Patterson.

159
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,958
Did you pack it for her?

160
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,583
No, sir. It was already packed
and corded.

161
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,291
Ah, that is interesting.

162
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,791
That shows that when she left
the house on Wednesday,

163
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,708
already she determined
not to return.

164
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,708
You see that, do you not?

165
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,458
Oh, I'd never thought of that.

166
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,583
No.

167
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,333
Tell me, now, Annie,

168
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,374
what was the very last thing
Eliza said to you

169
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,833
before she went out?

170
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,541
She said, "If there's any
stewed peaches left over

171
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,083
from the dining room,
we'll have them for supper,

172
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,416
and a bit of bacon
and fried potatoes."

173
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,041
Mad over stewed peaches,
she was.

174
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,499
I shouldn't wonder if that
wasn't the way they got her.

175
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,874
Got her?

176
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,541
The white slavers.

177
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,749
Ah.
The stewed peaches, quite.

178
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,708
Thank you very much, Annie.

179
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,416
You have been most helpful.

180
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,666
Was she saying things about me?

181
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,249
Not at all.

182
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,833
Only things
of the pleasantest nature.

183
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:43,666
But for a woman of your
intelligence, madame,

184
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,374
it would be tiresome
to bear with patience

185
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,124
the roundabout methods we
plodding detectives have to use.

186
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,541
Oh.
Oh, I see.

187
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:56,874
Well, I wouldn't say there was
all that much difference

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,999
between us, Mr. Poirot.

189
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,041
Mind you, I was always very good
at general knowledge at school.

190
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,041
There.

191
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,749
And your husband, too, I'm sure
is the intellectual, yes?

192
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,208
Yes, yes, he does very well
with figures.

193
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,249
A successful businessman?

194
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,583
With the Prudential, yes,
in the city.

195
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,666
What about the other inmates
of the house, madame?

196
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,291
Oh, you mean Mr. Simpson,
our paying guest.

197
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,291
What is his profession, madame?

198
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,458
Oh, he's in business, too,

199
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,666
with the Belgravia
and Overseas Bank.

200
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,333
Young man, is he?

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,999
28, I believe.
A nice young fellow.

202
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,166
Well, they'll both be in
at about 6:00,

203
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,291
if you want to see them.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,166
An excellent suggestion, madame.

205
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,583
Well, my colleague and I
will take a turn

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,541
on your famous common
for one hour.

207
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,499
It's a curious coincidence
that the paying guest Simpson

208
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,499
works in the same bank
as the absconding clerk.

209
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,291
They must have known each other.

210
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,124
Perhaps.

211
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,499
Or possibly
Davis visited Simpson,

212
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,166
fell in love with the cook,

213
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,041
and he persuaded her
to accompany him on his flight.

214
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,916
Come, Hastings, let us go back
to the prudential Monsieur Todd.

215
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:35,541
I've heard of you, Mr. Poirot,
haven't I?

216
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,624
It's possible, Monsieur Todd.

217
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,958
Oh, yes.

218
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,999
I follow crime, you know.

219
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,333
Indeed?

220
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,041
Well, perhaps you have
some theories

221
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,291
about the disappearance
of your cook.

222
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,666
Theories?

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,874
No.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
It's hardly a crime, is it?

225
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,499
A good cook, her, and economic.

226
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,166
I'm very hot in economy.

227
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,791
Admirable.

228
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,749
Now we would like to have a few
words with your Mr. Simpson,

229
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,874
if that's possible.

230
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,666
Another one after that.

231
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,458
Thank you.

232
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,874
Just off the next landing.

233
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,208
Mr. Simpson?

234
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,791
Hold on.

235
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:47,791
Yes?

236
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:52,249
Mr. Simpson, my name is Poirot.

237
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,791
Hercule Poirot.

238
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,708
Oh.

239
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,749
Yes.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,541
May we have a moment
of your so valuable time?

241
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,583
Certainly.
Come in.

242
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,666
Thank you.

243
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,583
Mr. Simpson,

244
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,041
Mrs. Todd has engaged me
to find Eliza Dunn, the cook.

245
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,708
Oh.
Where is she?

246
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,749
Well, that is what
we do not know, monsieur.

247
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,749
You know her, of course.

248
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, I must have met her,
I suppose.

249
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,291
It would seem that Miss Dunn has
not been seen since Wednesday.

250
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,291
Did you see her on that day?

251
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,208
I don't think so.

252
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,749
I don't know.

253
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,749
You were at work as usual,
on Wednesday?

254
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,916
Yes.

255
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,833
Thank you, Mr. Simpson.

256
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:10,791
It was most kind of you
to spare us the time.

257
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,333
Tell me, Mr. Simpson,

258
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,958
what does a young fellow find
to do around here

259
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,916
of an evening, huh?

260
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,833
Oh, the usual things, you know.

261
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,291
Musical evenings,
amateur theatricals,

262
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,666
that kind of thing?

263
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,624
Yes, I suppose so.

264
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,374
You do not interest yourself,
hmm?

265
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,499
Afraid not.

266
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,874
No.

267
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,666
Thank you.

268
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:57,958
I think that husband
has got something to do with it.

269
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,499
To do with the missing cook?

270
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,083
There's something about him
I don't trust.

271
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:05,583
Merely because a man does not
offer you a drink, Hastings,

272
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,791
does not mean
that he is necessarily

273
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,208
guilty of other crimes.

274
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,958
But there doesn't seem to be
any crime at all,

275
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,249
as far as I can see.

276
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:22,708
No, it is a curious case,
full of contradictory features.

277
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,624
I am interested.

278
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:31,416
Oh, yes.
I am distinctly interested.

279
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,458
What?!

280
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:37,833
How does she dare?

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,249
What is it?

282
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,166
As a favor, as a great favor,

283
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,208
I agreed to investigate this
two-penny, half-penny affair.

284
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,208
What is it, old chap?

285
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,208
Read it! Read it!

286
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,208
"Mr. Todd regrets that,
after all,

287
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:54,458
his wife will not avail herself
of Mr. Poirot's services.

288
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,458
After talking the matter over
with me,

289
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,999
she sees that it is foolish
to call in a detective

290
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,541
about a purely domestic affair.

291
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,124
Mr. Todd encloses a guinea
for consultation."

292
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,541
Is this to be believed?

293
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,916
Do they think they can get rid
of Hercule Poirot like that?

294
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,374
No.

295
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

296
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,749
36 times no.

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,583
They send me one guinea, huh?

298
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:17,583
No!

299
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,249
I will spend my own guineas.

300
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,291
3,600 of them, if need be.

301
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,041
But I will get to the bottom
of this matter.

302
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,624
If Eliza Dunn. . .

303
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:37,208
will communicate
with this address. . .

304
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,458
. . .she will hear something
to her profit.

305
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:44,791
Advantage.

306
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,124
-Yes?
-Yes.

307
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,374
Good.

308
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,499
-You have that, Miss Lemon?
-Yes, Mr. Poirot.

309
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,708
Put it in all the papers
you can think of.

310
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,958
She won't read The Times,
I shouldn't think.

311
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,458
No, my dear Miss Lemon,
perhaps she will not,

312
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,666
but perhaps her new employers
will.

313
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,749
Now run along, Miss Lemon.
Vite, vite.

314
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:06,166
And you, Hastings, do not you
run away with such celerity.

315
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,583
I have work for you, too.

316
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,708
Oh, as a matter of fact,

317
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,208
I was thinking of popping down
to Sandown this afternoon.

318
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,791
No, no, no.
You do not pop.

319
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,999
There's a horse running
a pal of mine earns a leg of.

320
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,249
When he owns four legs,
I pop with you.

321
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,958
But now is time for work, yes?

322
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,124
I want you to telephone

323
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,624
all the domestic agencies
you can find

324
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:33,041
and see if they have found
Miss Eliza Dunn a new post.

325
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:40,041
As for me. . .I pop to the city
of London.

326
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,249
And Mr. Simpson was at work
as usual on Wednesday?

327
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,833
Oh, yes, Mr. Simpson
is an excellent timekeeper.

328
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:56,416
To tell the truth, he was absent
on Thursday with a cold.

329
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,458
Well, you have been
most helpful, Mr. Cameron.

330
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,708
Thank you.

331
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,166
Glad to be of assistance.

332
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,166
It is an unfortunate occurrence,

333
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,416
this business
of Davis absconding.

334
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,458
Oh, you heard about that,
did you?

335
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,708
Well, one could scarcely
miss it.

336
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,374
The newspapers love scandals
about that.

337
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,749
Ah, that is human nature,
Mr. Cameron.

338
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,374
But it is comforting
for us mere mortals

339
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,958
to know that banks, too,
have their difficulties.

340
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,166
Again, I thank you, monsieur.

341
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,374
Chief Inspector Japp.

342
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,999
I wonder if I might ask you
a few questions.

343
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,458
You and Davis are friends,
I believe, Mr. Simpson.

344
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,291
That's right.

345
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,374
I can't believe this of him.

346
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,708
There must be some mistake.

347
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:04,874
If I told you, sir, the number
of times I've heard that said.

348
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:10,749
If you had to hazard
a conjecture, Mr. Simpson,

349
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,583
as to where Davis might go
if he wanted to hide,

350
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,041
where would you say?

351
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,624
I -- I don't know.

352
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:22,666
He was fond of Broadstairs.

353
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,999
Yes, I was thinking of somewhere

354
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,291
a little more exotic than that,
sir.

355
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,083
Foreign parts, even.

356
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,166
Oh, I don't think
he's ever been abroad.

357
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,791
You were at work as usual
on Wednesday,

358
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,291
were you, Mr. Simpson?

359
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,083
It's Thursday
you want to know about, surely,

360
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,999
and I was away on Thursday.

361
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,458
No, no, Mr. Simpson.

362
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:47,624
Although the bonds were found
to be missing on Thursday,

363
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,791
we believe that they must have
been removed from the bank

364
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:50,999
on Wednesday.

365
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,208
I was here all day Wednesday.

366
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,416
Now, sir. . .

367
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,249
That man.

368
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,624
What about him?

369
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,166
He was at my dig-ins yesterday.

370
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,583
Was he, by George?

371
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:32,916
Ah.

372
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,833
My dear Chief Inspector Japp.

373
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,416
After the reward, eh, Poirot?

374
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,083
Hmm?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

375
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,249
No, I am engaged
on quite a different case.

376
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,666
And what would
this different case be, then?

377
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,374
Ah, well, now, there is such a
thing as client confidentiality,

378
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:50,999
Chief Inspector.

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,458
Let me just say
that this case I am engaged on

380
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,791
is of national importance.

381
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,708
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
Poirot.

382
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,291
Someone was trying to tell me

383
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:03,791
you'd gone into
the missing domestics business.

384
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,083
No, no, I said.

385
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,458
Not Poirot, I said.

386
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,249
Hard times or not,
he wouldn't fall that far.

387
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,833
No word from Eliza Dunn,
Miss Lemon?

388
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,249
No, Mr. Poirot.

389
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,249
Another letter
from the Duchess of Braxton.

390
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,624
No, no, no.

391
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,624
She sounds desperate.

392
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,666
No.

393
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,249
Good heavens.

394
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:28,916
Mr. Poirot.
Mr. Poirot.

395
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,416
Yes, Miss Lemon, yes?

396
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,958
There's a letter, sir.
A letter from Eliza Dunn.

397
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,333
There!

398
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,666
Did I not tell you, Hastings?

399
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,666
And you tried to waste Poirot's
time with the duchesses.

400
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,791
Well, I only thought. . .

401
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,958
You must learn, my friend,
of patience.

402
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,083
Read it to us, Miss Lemon.

403
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,374
"Dear Sir or Madam,

404
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,166
ref. your add in the newspaper,
I already got my legacy,

405
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,791
if there's some mistake.

406
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,333
Yours truly, Eliza Dunn, Miss.

407
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,791
P.S. Thanks all the same
for your trouble."

408
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,708
What does she mean, "legacy"?

409
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,124
We must talk to this woman,
at. . .

410
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,291
Fell Cottage, Amdale, Kiswick.

411
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:04,333
Kiswick?

412
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,166
That's Keswick, Mr. Poirot,
in the Lake District.

413
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,291
Ah.
Are there trains to this place?

414
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,499
Oh, yes.

415
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,499
Bon.

416
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,958
Come, Hastings.
We have a train to catch.

417
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,708
But --

418
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,541
Look at it, Hastings.

419
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,458
Not a building in sight.

420
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:33,124
Not a restaurant, not a theater,
not an art gallery.

421
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,083
A wasteland.

422
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,833
I thought you liked the country.

423
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,333
But this is not the country,
my friend.

424
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:49,124
The country is full of trees
and flowers and public houses.

425
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,874
This is a desert.

426
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,499
I don't know why
we've come all this way, anyway.

427
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,583
You've found the cook.

428
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:01,166
The cook is but
the beginning of the story,

429
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,499
Hastings.

430
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,833
We're on to bigger things.

431
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:25,041
Look at that, Poirot.
Look at that view!

432
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,708
Yes, well,
views are very nice, Hastings,

433
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,791
but they should be painted
for us,

434
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,458
so that we may study them

435
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:37,916
in the warmth and comfort
of our own homes.

436
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,541
That is why we pay the artist,

437
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,458
for exposing himself to these
conditions on our behalf.

438
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:45,291
What do you mean, "conditions"?
It's a wonderful day.

439
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,416
Just fill your lungs
with that air.

440
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,124
No, my poor friend.

441
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:53,958
This sort of air is intended for
birds and little furry things.

442
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,249
The lungs of Hercule Poirot

443
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,208
demand something
more substantial.

444
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:01,374
The good air of the town.

445
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:08,124
Fell Cottage, I perceive.

446
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,208
We have got the right
Eliza Dunn, have we?

447
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,499
I mean, what is she doing
all the way up here?

448
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,833
That is what we are here
to find out.

449
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,749
Wonderful position.

450
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,749
If you are a rock,
it's wonderful.

451
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:33,666
Yes?

452
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,041
Miss Eliza Dunn?

453
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:36,749
Yes.

454
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,458
Formerly in the employ
of Mrs. Ernestine Todd

455
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:42,208
at 88 Prince Albert Road,
Clapham?

456
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,791
That's right.

457
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,666
I am Hercule Poirot, Miss Dunn.

458
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:50,083
You were kind enough to answer
my newspaper advertisement.

459
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:51,458
Oh, yes.

460
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,291
Well, like I said in my letter,
sir,

461
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,083
I've already got my legacy.

462
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,208
Miss Dunn, may we be permitted
to come into the house

463
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:00,124
for a moment?

464
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,333
I'm sure your employer
will not object.

465
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,249
No, she won't mind.

466
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,291
Come in.

467
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,333
Thank you.

468
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:08,958
Come in.

469
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,583
The reason I laughed, sir,
I'm sorry,

470
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,541
is I don't have no employer,
see.

471
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,833
This is my house.

472
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,708
Oh, Miss Dunn, forgive me.

473
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,124
That's all right, sir.
You wasn't to know.

474
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,999
This is part of my legacy, see.

475
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,374
Oh, sit down. Do.

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,749
Thank you.

477
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,791
Now, Miss Dunn,
you have mentioned your legacy,

478
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:51,083
but Captain Hastings and I,
we know nothing of this.

479
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,041
What was the ad, then?

480
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,374
Your late mistress, Mrs. Todd,
was much concerned about you.

481
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,583
She feared some accident
might have befallen you.

482
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,291
But didn't she get my letter?

483
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,041
No, she got no letter.

484
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,208
She got no word of any kind.

485
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:07,791
Oh, dear, sir.

486
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,666
I gave the letter
to Mr. Crotchet.

487
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,208
I said most particular
he was to give it to Mrs. Todd.

488
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,166
Oh, dear.

489
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:20,333
Perhaps you would recount
to Captain Hastings and me

490
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,083
the whole story.

491
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,791
Well, Wednesdays is my day out.

492
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,874
And it was last Wednesday
that it all started like.

493
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:34,374
The stone
which the builders rejected,

494
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,916
the same has become
the head of the corner.

495
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,083
I'd been over to see
my friend in Oxton

496
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:43,249
and I was on my way home,
when a gentleman stopped me.

497
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,999
He said he'd been asking for me
at number 88.

498
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,749
And he told me some story

499
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:53,291
about an old friend of
my grandmother's in Australia

500
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,208
leaving me a house
and some money in her will.

501
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,749
Well, I didn't believe him
at first.

502
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,958
And then he showed me
this letter.

503
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:07,124
It will be the stone which
the builders have rejected. . .

504
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,874
Who was these lawyers,
Hearst and Crotchet?

505
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,124
127 Wentworth Way, Melbourne?

506
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,624
Well, one of them
is right here, Miss Dunn.

507
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,749
"Benjamin Crotchet.

508
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,791
Attorney-at-law."

509
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,666
I hope that allays
your very understandable fears.

510
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,416
Oh, yes, indeed, sir.

511
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,708
I didn't mean to doubt you.

512
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,541
Now, Miss Dunn, to business.

513
00:30:43,084 --> 00:30:45,624
I do have to tell you
that the house is in Keswick.

514
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,833
That's just over by Acton,
isn't it, sir?

515
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:51,291
No, Miss Dunn. It's in the north
of England, near Carlisle.

516
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,083
Oh, my good God.

517
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,333
But before we confront
that particular difficulty,

518
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,583
there is one other stipulation

519
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:58,916
that we should get
out of the way.

520
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,374
What ever is that, sir?

521
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,249
Well, it's of no importance,

522
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,166
as it doesn't apply
in this case, thank heaven.

523
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,291
It's just a stipulation

524
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,583
that you should not be
in domestic service.

525
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,249
Oh.

526
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:15,541
What ever is the matter,
Miss Dunn?

527
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,999
I am a cook, sir.

528
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,958
Didn't they tell you
at the house?

529
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,708
My dear Miss Dunn,
I had no idea.

530
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,041
This is very unfortunate.

531
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,749
Will I have to lose the money,
sir?

532
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,208
And the house, sir?

533
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,708
It sounds ever so nice,

534
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,458
even if it is a bit
out of the way.

535
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:47,708
I believe I have it.

536
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,124
We lawyers always know
a thing or two.

537
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,999
The way out here is for you
to have left your employment

538
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,749
before we met.

539
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,124
But we have met, sir,
and I haven't.

540
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:05,374
-Haven't you?
-No.

541
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,333
Haven't you, Miss Dunn?

542
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,166
No.

543
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,499
Oh, I see.

544
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,208
Yes.

545
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,166
You left your employment
this morning, did you not,

546
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:23,958
before we met.

547
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,208
Yes, I remember now.

548
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,333
I did, as a matter of fact.

549
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:32,791
There.

550
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,916
Now, it is imperative

551
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,833
that you take possession of the
house by noon tomorrow.

552
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,208
In order to do that,

553
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,083
you must catch the night train
from King's Cross.

554
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,166
Oh!

555
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,624
Come along, Miss Dunn.

556
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,874
I can advance you £10 or so
for the fare

557
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,499
and you can write a note
to your employer at the station,

558
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,124
which I shall
personally deliver for you.

559
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,124
And was everything
as Mr. Crotchet had said?

560
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,291
Oh, yes, and more, sir.

561
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,124
Now, what about your luggage?

562
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:10,999
All the things you had left
at 88 Prince Albert Road?

563
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,333
Oh, well, Mr. Crotchet sent them
on, like he said he would.

564
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,874
But it was all done up
in brown paper, like.

565
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,499
I don't know.

566
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,458
I suppose Mrs. Todd
was angry with me,

567
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,916
and grudged me my bit of luck

568
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,041
and wouldn't let him have
my box.

569
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:29,208
-But Annie said the trunk was --
-Later, my friend.

570
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,791
Later.

571
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:34,874
But there you said
she never got my letter.

572
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:38,749
Well, I can't say
as I blame her.

573
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,333
I see.

574
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,624
Thank you, mademoiselle.

575
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,166
Oh.

576
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,749
There has been, as you say,

577
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,333
a little "muddle"
about your trunk,

578
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,291
which I will straighten out
with Mrs. Todd,

579
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,291
if you will permit.

580
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:58,999
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

581
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,249
Come, Hastings.

582
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:08,583
We must return to London
with all possible speed.

583
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,791
Is there nowhere you can contact
Chief Inspector Japp?

584
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,291
Then telephone him at his home.

585
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,041
Yes, of the greatest urgency.

586
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,208
Tell him he should not
be looking for Davis!

587
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,333
He should be looking
for Simpson!

588
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,833
No, not Davis, but Simpson!

589
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:53,791
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

590
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,958
Why should Japp want Simpson
all of a sudden?

591
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,041
What's Simpson
supposed to have done?

592
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:10,541
Hastings, my friend,

593
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,374
the little gray cells
are not working today, hein?

594
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,333
They take a little vacances,
hein?

595
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,833
It's to do with this Eliza,
isn't it?

596
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:22,708
No.

597
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,499
Oh.

598
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,749
We have moved
beyond the petty sphere

599
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,208
of cooks from Clapham, Hastings.

600
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:33,041
Then, it's something to do
with this Australian fellow?

601
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,041
There is no Australian fellow.

602
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,499
Yes, there is.
She told us about him.

603
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:44,249
Do you remember
when we interviewed Simpson?

604
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,166
Interviewed Simpson?

605
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,458
No.

606
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,041
In his little room,
at the house in Clapham.

607
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,958
Oh, right.
The lodger, yes.

608
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,791
Do you remember I asked him

609
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,916
if he took an interest
in amateur theatricals?

610
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,541
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

611
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,083
Why do you think
I asked him that?

612
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,416
Why?

613
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,083
Well, making conversation,
I suppose.

614
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:14,624
I asked him that

615
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,666
because he had recently
been wearing a false beard.

616
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,416
He had a tiny trace
of gum Arabic in his. . .

617
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:23,541
What do you call it here?

618
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:24,791
Sideburn.

619
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,583
Sideburn, yes.

620
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,291
Do you see?

621
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,624
Oh, right.
Yes.

622
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,208
Bon.

623
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,583
The Australian was Simpson
in a false beard.

624
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,374
Hey!

625
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:24,958
Who are you?

626
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,374
I am Hercule Poirot.

627
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,041
Who are you?

628
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,208
Sarge, there's some
French gent at the door.

629
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,041
No, no, no, no, no,
I am not some "French gent."

630
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,499
I am some Belgian gent.

631
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,499
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Poirot.

632
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,999
It is.

633
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,583
Is the lady of the house in?

634
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,708
The chief inspector is here.

635
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,083
Mr. Poirot.

636
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:48,791
Ah, Mrs. Todd.
Good morning.

637
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,833
I don't know how you have
the impertinence

638
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,291
to show your face here again!

639
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:55,583
You were paid off, Mr. Poirot.
You were paid off handsomely.

640
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,333
-Well. . .
-And then look at this.

641
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,333
We've got policemen crawling
all over the house!

642
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:02,249
You're not too popular
in Clapham this morning, Poirot.

643
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,083
A bit of a wild goose chase,
this.

644
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:07,124
As far as we can ascertain,
this Mr. Simpson of yours

645
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,666
is a perfectly respectable
young bank employee

646
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:13,333
who happens to have gone home
to his family.

647
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:16,041
We have the Shropshire
Constabulary checking that

648
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,041
at the moment.

649
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,458
I only wanted to ask --

650
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:19,666
No!

651
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,333
Well, perhaps you'd be
interested to know --

652
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,708
No, I wouldn't.

653
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,791
Good day, Mr. Poirot.

654
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,916
Poirot.

655
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,624
Annie, I need to ask you
a question.

656
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:01,916
Can you help me?

657
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,208
I'll try, sir.

658
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,374
Last Friday,
the Carter Patterson

659
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,583
came to collect Eliza's trunk,
yes?

660
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,541
Her box.
Yes, sir.

661
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,458
-You were here when he came?
-Oh, yes, sir.

662
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,249
I had to show them up
to Eliza's room

663
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,458
for them to take it up.

664
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,541
Bon.

665
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,041
It was ever so heavy, sir.

666
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:21,833
It took three of them
to get it down the stairs.

667
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,583
You all right, sir?

668
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,874
Of course.

669
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,416
Tell me, Annie, you said
her box was already packed.

670
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:35,333
Oh, yes, sir.
Packed, locked, and corded.

671
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,166
Quite a thick rope round it
and done up ever so tight.

672
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:41,374
Did it have a label on it?

673
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,083
Yes, it did, sir.

674
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,874
With an address?

675
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,416
Just her name.

676
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,333
Miss Eliza Dunn, it said.

677
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,666
Twickenham Station,
to be called for.

678
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,791
Very well, Annie.

679
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,291
Thank you.

680
00:39:58,417 --> 00:39:59,666
Au revoir.

681
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,666
Au revoir, sir.

682
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:06,499
Ah, excellent!

683
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,083
Then why would Crotchet
want to perpetrate

684
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,749
such an elaborate hoax?

685
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,916
Ah. That is a very good
question, Hastings.

686
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,041
But Eliza Dunn
has got her house.

687
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,833
I shall be surprised

688
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:32,208
if she finds she has more
than a six months' lease.

689
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,291
So, what did Crotchet want?

690
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,291
Crotchet?

691
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,541
Well, Simpson, then,
pretending to be Crotchet.

692
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,999
He wanted something
that Eliza Dunn had.

693
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,124
Money, the Australian legacy?

694
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,249
He wanted a battered
old tin trunk.

695
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,458
Her trunk, with nothing in it?

696
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,666
But he could buy a trunk.

697
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:55,166
Oh, but he did not want
a new trunk, mon ami.

698
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:56,958
He wanted a trunk of pedigree,

699
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,708
a trunk of assured
respectability.

700
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,833
Look here, Poirot, what would
Simpson want an old trunk for?

701
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:07,374
To put the body in, of course.

702
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:17,833
Sent on to Glasgow, gov,
to await collection there.

703
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,249
But how do you know this?

704
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,416
You have not consulted
your records.

705
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,083
I don't need to consult
my records, gov, do I?

706
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:26,333
What do you mean, body?
What body?

707
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,291
-Is he with you?
-Whose body?

708
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,874
I mean to say,

709
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,291
if there's going to be bodies
all over the place. . .

710
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:34,208
Doucement, Hastings.
All will be revealed to you.

711
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:36,374
Can we get on with the business
in hand?

712
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,749
By all means.

713
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,833
I saw to it myself, didn't I?

714
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,916
Yesterday morning.

715
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,416
Some cove with a beard.

716
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,208
Crotchet.

717
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,416
You spoke to this man?

718
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:47,708
Of course I spoke to him.

719
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:49,083
Did he give a name?

720
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,749
Nah, he just said
this Eliza Dunn was his aunt

721
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,083
and she wanted the trunk sent on
to Glasgow.

722
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,166
And it's gone?
You have sent it?

723
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:58,583
No.

724
00:41:58,709 --> 00:41:59,583
Every Friday,

725
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:01,916
the Southern Railway pays me
huge amounts of money

726
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,833
so I won't do
that sort of thing.

727
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,249
I think he's being sarcastic,
Poirot.

728
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:07,791
No, no, Hastings.

729
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:10,458
He is a good man.

730
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,958
He is doing the job
of great responsibility.

731
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,499
Thank you, monsieur.

732
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,583
I'll tell you one thing, though.

733
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,374
And what is that, monsieur?

734
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,916
You looking for this bloke
or something?

735
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,708
Well, of course
we're looking for him.

736
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,874
I'm talking to the engineer,
not the oil rag.

737
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,249
Now, look here!

738
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,749
Hastings.

739
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,916
What is this one thing
you will tell us, monsieur?

740
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,624
All right.

741
00:42:47,209 --> 00:42:48,458
I'll tell ya.

742
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,416
I'll tell you where he is.

743
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,583
There.

744
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,249
Go on.

745
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,208
Well, at least rough figures.

746
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:00,583
Ah, a bit less sure now.

747
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,624
I bet he is.
I bet he's where I say.

748
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,208
And where do you say?

749
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,833
Bolivia. There.

750
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,166
Bolivia?

751
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,999
That's in South America.

752
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,666
And what is it that makes
you think he is in Bolivia?

753
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,666
Well, going there,
at least on his way, like.

754
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,999
He has to pay for this trunk
to be sent on to Glasgow, see?

755
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,958
I see.

756
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:27,541
He takes out a wad of notes.

757
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:29,874
Could choke a cart horse,
it would.

758
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:32,124
There's a few English notes
there,

759
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,166
which he pays
what he owes me with,

760
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,416
but I couldn't help but notice

761
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:40,374
most of the other notes
were Bolivian.

762
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:45,166
Hastings,
this gentleman is a genius.

763
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:49,333
How do you know
they were Bolivian?

764
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,499
Well, one tiny little thing was

765
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:57,291
they had "Bolivia" written
all over them, didn't they?

766
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:05,458
Here we are --
this week's sailings.

767
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,416
Ah.

768
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,291
Nothing for Bolivia today.

769
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,166
Bolivia is a landlocked country,
Hastings.

770
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,749
Ah, that explains it, then.

771
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,833
So one sails to Buenos Aires
and goes by train from there.

772
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:20,583
What lovely names they all have.

773
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:22,958
"Queen of Heaven
sailing for Caracas."

774
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:24,666
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

775
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,749
Can we stick to Buenos Aires,
please?

776
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,458
Ah, here we are.

777
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,916
The S.S. Nevonia,
from Southampton, at 1:00 a.m.

778
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:36,541
Well, let's go, then.

779
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:43,499
Are we looking for Simpson
or the trunk?

780
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,583
Simpson, of course.

781
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,291
The trunk is in Glasgow.

782
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:52,708
But first, Scotland Yard.

783
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,583
And of course you see
some sinister point

784
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:09,708
in all this Arthur Simpson's
activities.

785
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:12,083
Yes, of course, Chief Inspector.

786
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,791
Six months' rent on a house,
£150 to Miss Dunn.

787
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,791
It is not much to assure
the success of his plan.

788
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:21,958
And this famous plan is?

789
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:23,791
I mean, we've heard a lot
about it, Mr. Poirot,

790
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,374
and I'm sure it's been
very entertaining.

791
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,708
We are wasting time,
Chief Inspector.

792
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,708
Go on, then.

793
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:33,249
His plan, of course,
is to steal £90,000 worth

794
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,541
of negotiable securities

795
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,458
from the Belgravia
and Overseas Bank.

796
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,166
No.

797
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:43,124
That's Davis.

798
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,124
Here it is, Sergeant.

799
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,541
Chief Inspector Japp speaking.

800
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:10,999
Ah, yes, Sergeant.

801
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,083
Good, good.

802
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,708
It's Glasgow.
They found the trunk.

803
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:17,791
And?

804
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:19,333
What do you mean, "and"?

805
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,749
Have they opened it?

806
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,958
Sergeant Hendry,
have you opened the trunk?

807
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:30,208
Ah, yes, I see.

808
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:34,458
Apparently they need a warrant
on them.

809
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,166
Mon Dieu.
There is a body in that trunk.

810
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:42,041
A body.

811
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,499
Look, Sergeant, there seems
to be the possibility

812
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:47,208
there's a body in that trunk.

813
00:46:47,334 --> 00:46:48,583
Yes, a dead body.

814
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,083
You will?

815
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,541
Right.
Thank you.

816
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:56,458
He thinks
that may expedite matters.

817
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,958
He's going to ring me back.

818
00:46:58,084 --> 00:46:59,999
Now, then, what body?
Whose body?

819
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,749
Davis, of course.

820
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,416
This is nonsense, Poirot.

821
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,749
Davis stole those securities
from the bank,

822
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,333
Davis is the one
who disappeared the day. . .

823
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,874
after.

824
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,124
Precisely.

825
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,208
You think what Simpson
wanted you to think.

826
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,999
Listen, Chief Inspector.

827
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:23,708
On Wednesday, Simpson,
disguised, decoys away the cook.

828
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:30,666
Now, he has already removed
the securities from the bank,

829
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:33,208
but knows that this
will not be discovered

830
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,416
until Thursday afternoon.

831
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,958
Now, he does not go to the bank
on Thursday.

832
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,416
Instead he lies in wait for
Davis when he comes out to lunch

833
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,124
and asks him to come to Clapham
with him.

834
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:48,541
Now, it is the maid's day out.

835
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:51,874
Mrs. Todd is at the shops.

836
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,541
There is no one in the house.

837
00:47:56,584 --> 00:48:01,124
Simpson kills Davis.

838
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,541
The one difficulty
for a murderer

839
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,083
is the disposal of the body.

840
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:23,083
And that is why Simpson wanted
the trunk of Miss Eliza Dunn.

841
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,541
And now, if I am not much
mistaken, my friends,

842
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,833
it is here we will apprehend
our murderer.

843
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:48,624
Have I got something wrong,
Chief Inspector?

844
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,249
No, no, Poirot.
Can't be right every time.

845
00:48:57,959 --> 00:48:59,208
Mon Dieu, I am wrong.

846
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,333
I am wrong.

847
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,749
Officer.

848
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,916
Where does the Queen of Heaven
sail from tonight?

849
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:11,958
Why, from pier 5, sir,
over there.

850
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,791
Poirot, where are we going?

851
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:17,333
The Queen of Heaven
sails for Caracas tonight.

852
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:20,124
I remember it from The Times.

853
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:25,374
Yes, but Caracas
isn't in Bolivia, is it?

854
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:28,999
What the porter saw on
the bank note was not Bolivia.

855
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,458
-What was it, then?
-It was bolivar.

856
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:34,708
And the bolivar is the unit
of currency in Venezuela.

857
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,874
Our friend is on his way
to Venezuela!

858
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:53,666
Simpson!

859
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,958
Stop that man!

860
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:15,666
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Miss Lemon.

861
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:16,749
To the left.

862
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,374
At least one centimeter
to the left.

863
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:23,999
That's better.

864
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:31,458
Voilà.

865
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:33,916
Is there nothing
to which Hercule Poirot

866
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:35,541
cannot turn his finger?

867
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,583
Hand.

868
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,666
Pay to Hercule Poirot,
the sum of one guinea only.

869
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,583
Ernest Todd.

870
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:50,041
It is to me, Hastings,
a little reminder

871
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,458
never to despise the trivial,
hein,

872
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,083
or the undignified.

873
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,249
A disappearing domestic
at one hand,

874
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:02,749
a cold-blooded murder
at the other.
