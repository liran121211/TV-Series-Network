1
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,333
Isn't it a big bonfire?

2
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,124
Yes.

3
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,749
Hastings, my friend, tell me,

4
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,624
to blow up
the English Parliament --

5
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,416
was it a sin or a noble deed?

6
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,166
Oh, it's no good
asking me, old son.

7
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,291
I was never much of a one
for politics.

8
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,249
Where's Mrs. Japp tonight, then?

9
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,874
She can't abide fireworks.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,249
Ah, the noise disturbs

11
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,916
the delicate sensibilities
of many ladies.

12
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,041
Maybe, maybe.

13
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,416
I think it's more

14
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:06,666
that she doesn't like to see
people enjoying themselves.

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,916
Tell you what, though, what
a good night for a murder, eh?

16
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,083
I mean, if somebody
wanted to kill anybody,

17
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,041
nobody would know if it was
a gunshot or a firework.

18
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,083
Mm.

19
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,458
But not so good, my friend,

20
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,541
if your chosen method
is strangulation.

21
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,958
No, that's true. No.

22
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,874
Or poisoning, come to that.

23
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,666
Yes.

24
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,124
You're pulling my leg.

25
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,833
Yes, Hastings,
we pull ever so gently the leg.

26
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,624
Well, I still think it's a jolly
good night for a murder.

27
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,208
Anyway,
I'm going to leave you here.

28
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,291
-This is where I garaged my car.
-Ah.

29
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:47,166
Good night, Chief Inspector.
Good night, Poirot.

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,249
Good night, Captain Hastings.

31
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,333
A demain.

32
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,708
Good night!

33
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:54,833
Steady on, lads.

34
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,541
You won't forget your dental
appointment at 11:00,

35
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,791
will you, Mr. Poirot?

36
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:35,374
Hercule Poirot does not need to
go to the dentist, Miss Lemon.

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,208
You've put it off once already.

38
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,874
My teeth are perfection.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,083
It is sacrilege
to tamper with them.

40
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,291
But why do we not do something
constructive about my collars,

41
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,333
Miss Lemon, hmm?

42
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,458
That laundry is in the pay
of my enemies.

43
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,541
Hercule Poirot's residence.

44
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,333
-Poirot, please.
-Oh.

45
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:55,958
-Japp here.
-Yes.

46
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:57,583
Chief Inspector Japp.

47
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,124
He's here.

48
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,916
Good morning,
Chief Inspector Japp.

49
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,124
Here's a strange thing, Poirot.

50
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,916
You remember how we stopped

51
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,708
at the end of Bardsley Garden
Mews last night,

52
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,791
where your friend Hastings
keeps his car,

53
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,749
and Hastings was saying
about how the sound of a shot

54
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,749
could be covered
by the noise of a firework?

55
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,791
Yes.

56
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,291
Well, someone did it.

57
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:29,416
Really?

58
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,333
Not murder.
It looks like suicide.

59
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,791
But they're not entirely happy
about it.

60
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,124
Hmm.

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,666
I'll meet you there in one hour.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,666
Cancel all my appointments
for this morning, Miss Lemon.

63
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,833
But I've --

64
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,999
Good of you to spare the time,
Poirot.

65
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,833
No, no, no, no, no, not at all.

66
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,583
But I hope you appreciate,
my friend,

67
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,416
the urgent business I have
had to cancel to be here.

68
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,958
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yes.

69
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,791
The dead woman is a Mrs. Allen.

70
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,458
She shared the house
with a friend,

71
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,791
Miss Plenderleith, who is
a professional photographer

72
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,874
or something along those lines.

73
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,583
Miss Plenderleith was away
in the country.

74
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:23,624
But when she came home
this morning,

75
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,833
she finds
her friend's door locked.

76
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,749
She knocks and calls
but can't get any answer.

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,708
In the end, she gets really
alarmed and calls the police.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,083
10:45,
our lads break the door down,

79
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,333
and there's Mrs. Allen lying
in a heap on the floor,

80
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,291
shot through the head.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,374
Right, Brett.
What's the trouble?

82
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:48,416
Well, the position's all right.

83
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,499
If she'd shot herself,

84
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,499
she'd probably have slipped
from the chair

85
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,666
into just that position.

86
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:53,708
But?

87
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,749
The prints on the gun,
sir -- they're the problem.

88
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,583
Bit of a thumbprint
and a forefinger,

89
00:05:58,709 --> 00:05:59,624
and that's all.

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,708
Just what you'd get

91
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,999
from someone trying to press the
dead woman's fingers on the gun

92
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,458
and not doing it very well.

93
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,499
Mm.

94
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,208
Gun in left hand,
wound on the left side.

95
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,916
Presumably she was left-handed.

96
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,124
It looks as though
she's holding the gun,

97
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,083
but, in fact, she isn't.

98
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,291
It's just sort of lying
in her hand.

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,708
Anything else?

100
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,374
The window was closed
and bolted,

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,499
and the door was locked.

102
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,333
We haven't been able to find
the key.

103
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,499
What's this, then?

104
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,874
It might mean something.

105
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,708
Anything strike you?

106
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,458
I was looking at her watch.

107
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:56,999
Hmm.

108
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,708
Expensive, by the look of it.

109
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,999
Tuesday, November 5th.

110
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,249
How long she been dead?

111
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:13,083
She died at about 11:30
last night.

112
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,624
No sign of any note
having been written.

113
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,874
No.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,833
Seems to me all we've got
to go on at the moment

115
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,208
is the missing key.

116
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,583
If the key was here,
we wouldn't hesitate.

117
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,666
Suicide, we'd say.

118
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,916
This must be a terrible shock
to you, Miss Plenderleith.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,499
I still can't believe it.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,666
We'll be as brief as possible.

121
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,791
Now, you've already told
Inspector Jameson

122
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,624
how you found the body
when you came in this morning.

123
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,999
You were away for the weekend,
I take it.

124
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,416
Yes, since Friday noon.

125
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,541
Uh, pardon, mademoiselle.

126
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:09,166
When you found the door locked,
you called the police.

127
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,208
Did it not occur to you
that she might have gone away

128
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:14,833
and locked the door
before leaving?

129
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,291
Why should she lock it?

130
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,249
In any case, she would have left
a note for me.

131
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,916
And she did not leave any note?

132
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,041
Of course she didn't.

133
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,083
Ah.

134
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,124
Tell me about Mrs. Allen,
Miss Plenderleith.

135
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,916
I met her abroad.

136
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,708
She was on her way back
from India.

137
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,583
I was looking for someone
to share a flat with me.

138
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,708
We decided we liked each other.

139
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,333
What about the husband?

140
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,916
Nothing to write home about,
apparently.

141
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,541
He drank, I think.

142
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,249
Died a year or two
after the marriage.

143
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,458
Do you know if Mrs. Allen was in
any financial difficulties?

144
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,499
No, I'm sure she wasn't.

145
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,874
Did she have any particular
man friend or men friends?

146
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,624
She was engaged to be married
again,

147
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,166
if that answers your question.

148
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,124
What's the name of the man
she was engaged to?

149
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,583
Oh, my God.
I haven't told Charles.

150
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,958
Who is Charles, miss?

151
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,166
The man Barbara
was engaged to --

152
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,874
Charles Laverton West.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,208
He's M.P. for someplace
in Hampshire.

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,999
I should have phoned him.

155
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,916
We'll go 'round and see him.

156
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,416
But there would be no quarrel
between them,

157
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,458
as far as you know?

158
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:27,999
I'd be very surprised.

159
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,749
Barbara wasn't
the quarreling kind.

160
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,874
What is your own opinion

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,624
of M. Laverton West,
mademoiselle?

162
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,791
He's young, ambitious,
a good public speaker,

163
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:42,874
means to get on in the world.

164
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,416
And on the debit side?

165
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,749
Well, in my opinion, he's
commonplace and rather pompous.

166
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,833
Those are not very serious
faults, mademoiselle.

167
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,374
Oh.
You don't think so?

168
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:04,208
Well, they might be to you,
but to Mrs. Allen... no.

169
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,749
She would not notice them.

170
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,833
You were fond of your friend?

171
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,416
Yes, very.

172
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,208
I know this must be
upsetting for you,

173
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,249
Miss Plenderleith,

174
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,041
but there are just
one or two more questions

175
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,416
I'd like to ask you.

176
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,916
Mrs. Allen was left-handed,
wasn't she?

177
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,249
Left-handed?

178
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,624
No, I don't think so.

179
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,249
No, I'm sure she wasn't.

180
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,416
Really?

181
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,958
You see, Mrs. Allen was shot
in the left temple,

182
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,874
and the gun was in
her left hand.

183
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,666
Didn't you notice that
when you found the body?

184
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,041
No, I didn't.

185
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,541
It was so horrible.

186
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,041
I didn't notice anything.

187
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,333
That's understandable, miss,
but it seems highly unlikely

188
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,499
that a normally
right-handed person

189
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,124
would shoot themselves
left-handed.

190
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,499
Have you ever seen this before?

191
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,624
No.

192
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,666
It's not yours,
nor Mrs. Allen's?

193
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,833
It's not the kind of thing
normally worn by our sex, is it?

194
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,458
Oh, so, you recognize it.

195
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,958
I don't recognize it.
I recognize what it is, though.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,666
It's half of a man's cuff link.

197
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,874
Hastings!

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,916
Once we've got
this filter screwed down good...

199
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:31,999
Hastings?

200
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,208
...and tight,

201
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,666
we can put the new oil in,

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,833
and she will run
like a well-oiled clock.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,249
Hastings?

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,499
Hello?

205
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,624
What are you doing, Hastings?

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,291
Well, I thought I'd just do
some work on the car.

207
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,499
But you were to ask questions,
Hastings,

208
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,291
to sound out local opinion.

209
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,499
Oh, I've done that.
Freddie?

210
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,374
Freddie's helping
with the oil filter.

211
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,916
That'll hold her.
Should be tight for now.

212
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,749
We'll put the spanner to it,
then put in a new gasket.

213
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,416
Right. This is Mr. Poirot.

214
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,666
How are you, gov?

215
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,999
I'm Fred Hogg.
You can call me Freddie.

216
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,333
Hello, Freddie.

217
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,416
Freddie's got the goods.

218
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,791
Did you see something
last night?

219
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,916
Well, Mrs. Allen -- she went
to the post box about 6:00.

220
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,583
About half-9:00, though,
a car pulled up.

221
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,291
Standard Swallow Saloon.

222
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,624
Rubbish, really,
but it looked smart.

223
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,083
A man got out.

224
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,291
He was about -- about 45,
well set up.

225
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,666
Military-looking gent.

226
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,208
You've seen him before?

227
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,749
Yeah, a couple of times.

228
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,416
Dark blue overcoat,
toothbrush mustache.

229
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,291
He was in there
for about an hour.

230
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,791
I saw them come out together.

231
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:46,958
So you saw him leave?

232
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:48,083
I don't miss much, gov.

233
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,333
Then you heard
what they said, of course.

234
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,041
Yeah, he said, "Think it over
and let me know,"

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,374
and she said something
and then he said, "So long."

236
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,916
And the way they talked --
they were friendly, yes?

237
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,666
Can't always tell with toffs,
can you,

238
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:02,791
but they seemed all right.

239
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,458
You didn't hear
what Mrs. Allen said?

240
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,041
Nah, she was sort of 'round
behind the door.

241
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,083
Now, look here, my boy,

242
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,499
I want you to answer my next
question very carefully.

243
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,083
If you don't know the answer or
can't remember, you just say so.

244
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,333
That clear?

245
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,374
Ask the question.

246
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,749
Which of them shut the door --
Mrs. Allen or the gentleman?

247
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,041
I think the lady did.

248
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,416
No, she never.
It was him.

249
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,124
He pulled it to with a big bang

250
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,583
and then got into the car
really quick.

251
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:32,624
Ah.

252
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,999
Here you are, my boy.

253
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,999
You seem a bright
kind of shaver.

254
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,541
Here's sixpence for you.

255
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,958
Oh, that's very kind of you,
sir,

256
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,624
but you couldn't see a way
to making it a shilling,

257
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,666
could you?

258
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,041
Go on.
Clear off.

259
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,124
Chief Inspector Japp
and Mr. Poirot, sir.

260
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,291
Good day, gentlemen.

261
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,541
To what do I owe this pleasure?

262
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,208
No great pleasure, sir,
I'm afraid.

263
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,624
Oh?

264
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,416
We've brought some bad news.

265
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,791
Go on.

266
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,708
It's about Mrs. Allen,
Mrs. Barbara Allen.

267
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,999
What about her?

268
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,208
Get on with it, man.

269
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,749
She's dead, sir.

270
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,374
Dead?

271
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:49,708
I don't believe it.

272
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,541
What's happened?

273
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,583
Apparently suicide, sir.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,999
Was there anything worrying
Mrs. Allen, do you know?

275
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,874
No, not a thing.
We were engaged to be married.

276
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,499
Yes, quite so.

277
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,041
I can't believe it.

278
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,499
Dead?

279
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,874
How?

280
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,791
Shot, sir.

281
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,583
Shot?

282
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,624
Good God, I hope the newspapers
haven't got ahold of this.

283
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,041
I couldn't say, sir.

284
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,416
I wonder if I could just ask --

285
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,583
Hello?

286
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,374
Ah, yes.
Yes, thank you.

287
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,874
I'll hold on.
It's the prime minister.

288
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,791
I will have some questions, sir.

289
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,791
Just make an appointment
with my secretary at the house.

290
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:37,999
Yes, I'm still here.

291
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,874
Very good, sir.
We'll do that.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,458
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of such bad news.

293
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:48,916
Pardon, monsieur.

294
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:52,041
Allow me to express my deepest
sympathy at your loss.

295
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,333
Yes, right, thank you.

296
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:57,874
Um, stiff upper lip, you know.
That's the British way.

297
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,666
Magnifique.

298
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,666
By the way, sir,
was Mrs. Allen left-handed?

299
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:07,583
Left-handed?

300
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:08,958
No, I don't think so.

301
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,458
Can't say I ever --

302
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:14,666
No, she was right-handed,
I'm sure.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,333
Ah, Prime Minister.

304
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,083
No, not at all, Prime Minister.

305
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,791
Yes.

306
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,083
Yes, everything's ready for you.

307
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,083
What a stuffed fish.

308
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,583
No, not a stuffed fish.
A boiled owl.

309
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,583
As you say, Japp.

310
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,791
More concerned
about the newspapers

311
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,458
than his fiancée being dead.

312
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,333
The Plenderleith girl
was quite right about him.

313
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,458
Mind you,
he's a good-looking chap.

314
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,583
Might go down well
with some women.

315
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,833
Perhaps, but it would not do,
I think,

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,666
for them to have
a sense of humor.

317
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,208
The important thing is,

318
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,999
everyone seems agreed that
Mrs. Allen was right-handed.

319
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,041
Yes.

320
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,166
Of course, one must not jump
to conclusions, mon ami.

321
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,708
Never mind about jumping
to conclusions, Poirot.

322
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:07,833
This is a murder
we're dealing with.

323
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,833
To the Bulldog Breed Laundry --

324
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,458
Dear sirs...

325
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,999
once again...

326
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,958
I am obliged...

327
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,333
to communicate to you...

328
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,458
the dissatisfaction I have...

329
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:47,833
...for your starching...

330
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,291
of my collars.

331
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,333
I refer...

332
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,458
to my instructions...

333
00:17:58,167 --> 00:17:59,583
of the 2nd of March, 1935,

334
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,916
and subsequent letters.

335
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,291
And you look them up
in the file, Miss Lemon,

336
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,333
and enumerate them.

337
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:11,541
All of them, Mr. Poirot?

338
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,083
All of them, Miss Lemon.

339
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,083
It has become serious.

340
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,041
The trouble is, Mr. Poirot,

341
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,499
they just don't understand
the letters.

342
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,916
Why not?

343
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,999
They're Chinese, Mr. Poirot.

344
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,374
The Bulldog Breed Laundry
is Chinese?

345
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,624
Yes, Mr. Poirot.

346
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,083
What is the world coming to,
Miss Lemon?

347
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,458
I'm sure I couldn't say, sir,

348
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,458
but when the boy brings
your laundry back,

349
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,166
he brings the letters back, too,
for me to explain to him.

350
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,208
And you do?

351
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,583
No.

352
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:40,958
Why not?

353
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,666
I don't speak Chinese.

354
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,083
So, what do you say to him?

355
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,916
Well, I -- I say, "Him collar
no velly good, starchy."

356
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:57,166
I show him the collars
and say it.

357
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,416
Hastings, my friend,

358
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,958
you spent some years in China,
did you not?

359
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,249
Oh, absolutely.
Fine fellows, fine fellows.

360
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,374
Did you ever have any trouble
with your laundry?

361
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,166
Yes, I did, as a matter of fact.

362
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,083
And what did you say to them?

363
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:17,541
Well, I said, "Him collar
no velly good, starchy."

364
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,374
That's where I got it from, sir.

365
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,374
I asked the captain,
knowing he'd been in the East.

366
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,416
But, Hastings, my collars,
they do not get any better.

367
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:28,541
No, mine didn't, either,
now I come to think about it.

368
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,916
Miss Lemon.

369
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,791
Why don't you get yourself some
turned-down collars, Poirot?

370
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,833
They're much more the thing,
you know.

371
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,541
"The thing," Hastings?

372
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,874
Do you think Poirot concerns
himself with mere "thingness"?

373
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,249
-Uh, no, no.
-No.

374
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,333
No, I-I-I see that, Poirot.

375
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,666
The turned-down collar

376
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,708
is the first symptom of decay
of the gray cells.

377
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:58,041
It's Chief Inspector Japp,
Mr. Poirot.

378
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,833
Well, she's out of it.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,749
Good morning,
Chief Inspector Japp.

380
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,458
Yes, well, good morning.

381
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,333
Now, who is out of it?

382
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:11,999
Plenderleith.

383
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,749
She was playing bridge in Essex
up till midnight.

384
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,291
We've got to give up any idea

385
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,416
of her being concerned
in the business.

386
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,416
A disappointment, Japp?

387
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,624
You are still convinced we are
dealing here with a murder?

388
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,166
No doubts about it.

389
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,124
Something I've been meaning
to ask you, Poirot.

390
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:37,374
Hmm?

391
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,249
What was that
you were sniffing at in the room

392
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,916
when we first examined the body?

393
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,249
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

394
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,124
-You got a cold, have you?
-No.

395
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,458
I always thought

396
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,291
the little gray cells
were in your brain.

397
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,999
Don't tell me your nose cells

398
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,374
are superior to everyone else's,
too.

399
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,583
By no means.

400
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,583
It was merely cigarette smoke.

401
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:57,124
I didn't smell cigarette smoke.

402
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,916
No more did I, my friend.

403
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,833
There were nine cigarette ends
in the ashtray,

404
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,291
six of them gaspers,
three Turkish.

405
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,458
Exactly.

406
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,999
Your wonderful nose cells knew
that without looking, I suppose.

407
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,624
I assure you my nose
does not enter into the matter.

408
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,541
My nose registered nothing.

409
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,041
But the brain cells
registered a lot?

410
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,458
Well, there were
certain indications.

411
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,333
Did you not think so?

412
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,874
Now, am I wrong,

413
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,333
or are we going to talk further

414
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,166
with the beautiful
Miss Plenderleith?

415
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,374
Yes.

416
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,583
You know, there was something
missing from that room,

417
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,166
Chief Inspector...

418
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,666
but also something added,
I think.

419
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,458
You know what's
worrying me, Poirot?

420
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,416
Yes.

421
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,249
"Yes"?
What do you mean, "yes"?

422
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,374
I saw you looking

423
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,708
at Mrs. Allen's checkbook stubs
yesterday.

424
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,291
You're too clever for your own
good, you are, Poirot.

425
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,624
And you noticed, as I did,

426
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,291
that Mrs. Allen drew out
£200 in cash from her bank

427
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:04,333
on Monday morning.

428
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:07,291
And three months ago, on the 6th
of August, another £200.

429
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,708
-Truly?
-Truly.

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,166
And there's no £200 in this
house that my lads could find.

431
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,249
I'm afraid, Miss Plenderleith,

432
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,499
that we are no longer treating
this as a case of suicide.

433
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,999
Not suicide?

434
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,374
You see,
being as how your friend

435
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,874
was in no way, shape, or form

436
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,499
likely to commit suicide,

437
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,291
we have to consider
the alternative -- murder.

438
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,499
Murder?

439
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,749
Are you sure?

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,249
How horrible.

441
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,874
Horrible, perhaps, mademoiselle,
but impossible?

442
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:48,458
I suppose it's possible.

443
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:52,416
And if there was a murder,
there would have to be a motive.

444
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,166
Ask me any questions you like.

445
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,583
But I don't see
how I can help you.

446
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,541
On Monday night,
Mrs. Allen had a visitor.

447
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,999
He's described as a man of 45,
military bearing,

448
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,916
toothbrush mustache,
smartly dressed,

449
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,499
and driving
a Standard Swallow Saloon car.

450
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,874
Do you know who that is?

451
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,208
It sounds like Major Eustace.

452
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,666
Who's Major Eustace?

453
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,874
He was a man
Barbara had known in India.

454
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,666
He turned up about a year ago,

455
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,374
and we've seen him on and off
since.

456
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,249
He was a friend of Mrs. Allen's?

457
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,416
He behaved like one.

458
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,291
Would it surprise you,
Miss Plenderleith,

459
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,666
if I suggested that this man
was blackmailing Mrs. Allen?

460
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,874
Of course!

461
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,458
So that was it.

462
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,208
Of course!

463
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,583
You find the suggestion
feasible, mademoiselle?

464
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,291
I was a fool not to think of it.

465
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,624
Oh, I wish she'd told me.

466
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:54,208
I'd have told him
to go to the devil.

467
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:55,916
But he might have gone,

468
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,291
might he not,
to M. Laverton West?

469
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,833
Yes.

470
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,583
Yes, that's true.

471
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,833
Which room do you think

472
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,499
Mrs. Allen would have received
her visitor in?

473
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,999
Oh, probably in here.

474
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,874
On the other hand,

475
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,041
if she wanted to write a check
or anything of that kind,

476
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,208
she'd probably take him
upstairs.

477
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:18,791
There's no question of a check.

478
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,333
Mrs. Allen drew out £200 in cash
on Monday.

479
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,041
So far, we've not been able
to find any trace of it

480
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,291
in the house.

481
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,499
But I'd like to have just
one more look 'round, if I may.

482
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,416
Look anywhere you like.

483
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,291
Thank you.

484
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,708
Would you like to sit down?

485
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:42,374
Thank you.

486
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,374
Cigarette?

487
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,791
You are most kind.

488
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,083
This cupboard under the stairs,
Miss Plenderleith.

489
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,624
It's locked.

490
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,999
Yes, I've already
found that out.

491
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,958
Could I have the key, please?

492
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,708
Um... I don't know where it is.

493
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,874
Oh. That's too bad.

494
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:40,708
Don't want to have to break
the lock.

495
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,749
No.

496
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,541
Um... it might be upstairs.

497
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,708
I managed to find it.

498
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,624
Good.

499
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,333
We keep it locked.

500
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:22,291
Otherwise, one's umbrellas
and things

501
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,208
have a habit of getting pinched.

502
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:28,083
Very sensible.
Right.

503
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:40,333
That's mine.

504
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,124
It came back with me
yesterday morning,

505
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,166
so there can't be
anything there.

506
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,458
Just as well to be
on the safe side.

507
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:56,833
Nothing much there.

508
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:00,791
No, well, there couldn't
have been, could there?

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,249
Sorry to bother you again,
Mr. Laverton West.

510
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,541
Couldn't it have waited?

511
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,416
This sort of inquiry
is often inconvenient, sir.

512
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,458
I don't mind the inconvenience
if I see the results.

513
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,208
Have you any idea yet,
Chief Inspector,

514
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,208
what caused Mrs. Allen
to take her own life?

515
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:27,374
Well, perhaps it will be
more understandable, sir,

516
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,416
if I tell you that it was
not suicide, but murder.

517
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,041
What are you talking about?

518
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,416
Have you any idea,
Mr. Laverton West,

519
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,249
who might have
any conceivable motive?

520
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,624
No. It's bizarre.

521
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,833
The mere idea is unimaginable.

522
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,999
She never mentioned any enemies,

523
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,124
anyone who might bear a grudge
against her?

524
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,499
Never.

525
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,666
Do you know a Major Eustace?

526
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,166
Eustace?

527
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,541
Oh, yes, I remember.

528
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,624
I met him once at Barbara's.

529
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,791
Mrs. Allen's.

530
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,333
Rather a doubtful type,
in my opinion.

531
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:09,999
I said as much to Mrs. Allen.

532
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,083
He wasn't the sort of man
I should have encouraged

533
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,541
to come to the house
after we were married.

534
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,541
Look, I've got to get dressed.

535
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,874
What did Mrs. Allen say to that?

536
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,749
She quite agreed.

537
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,708
She trusted my judgment
implicitly.

538
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,333
And naturally, as my wife,

539
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,374
she would have found a good many
of her old associates,

540
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,416
well, unsuitable, shall we say?

541
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,124
Quite.

542
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,333
What can you tell me
about your own movements

543
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,374
on the night of November 5th,
sir?

544
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,583
My movements?

545
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:49,624
Purely a matter of routine, sir.

546
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,166
We have to ask everybody.

547
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,124
I should have thought a man
in my position

548
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,208
might have been exempt.

549
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:58,249
It doesn't work quite like that,
sir.

550
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,499
Very well.

551
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,541
Let me see.

552
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,083
I was at the House of Commons,

553
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:08,249
left about half past 10:00,

554
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,624
went for a walk
along the embankment,

555
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,166
watched some of the fireworks.

556
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,916
Lucky there aren't any plots
like that nowadays.

557
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,124
Then I walked home.

558
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,499
What time did you arrive?

559
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,749
Somewhere about 11:15, 11:30.

560
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,583
Perhaps someone let you in.

561
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,874
No.

562
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,208
Did you meet anyone
whilst walking?

563
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:37,999
No.

564
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,208
What an alibi.

565
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,333
It's so feeble,
it must be genuine.

566
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,958
No, I'm not bothered about him.

567
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,999
It's the Plenderleith girl
that worries me.

568
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,999
I'd still like to know

569
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,416
why she got so hot and bothered
about that briefcase.

570
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,416
That's something in your line,
Poirot.

571
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,708
You like chasing about

572
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,583
after the kind of triviality
that leads nowhere --

573
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:09,291
the mystery
of the perambulating briefcase.

574
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,333
Sounds quite promising.

575
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,541
No, you got to work south
a little.

576
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,333
No, you got to work east now,
boys.

577
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,999
Nunca, nunca.

578
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,499
Major Eustace in the club?

579
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,499
Major Eustace?

580
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,458
Yes.

581
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:39,666
Chief Inspector Japp,
Scotland Yard.

582
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:41,041
Oh, yes?

583
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:43,999
Drink?

584
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,708
No, thank you, sir.
Might we have a word?

585
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,874
Uh, yes.

586
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:51,624
Shall we go over here?

587
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,874
Well, well, well.

588
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,208
Take a pew.

589
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,333
It's not often I get honored

590
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,583
by a big gun
like a chief inspector.

591
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,291
No, thank you.

592
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,499
Ah.

593
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,458
You smoke Turkish, I see.

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,249
Yes.

595
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,833
Would you prefer a gasper?

596
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,833
I've got some.

597
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,041
Somewhere.

598
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,041
No, no, this'll do fine, thanks.

599
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:33,374
I think you knew Mrs. Barbara
Allen, Major Eustace.

600
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:35,583
Ah, yes.

601
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,083
Very sad business.

602
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,499
Saw it in the paper last night.

603
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,124
You met her out in India,
I believe.

604
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,166
Yes.

605
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,833
That's some years ago now.

606
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,333
Did you also know her husband?

607
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,999
No, as a matter of fact,
I never came across Allen.

608
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,166
But you know something
about him.

609
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,541
I heard he was by way
of being a bad hat.

610
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,041
Of course, that was, uh,
only hearsay.

611
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,916
Mrs. Allen never spoke
about him?

612
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:01,958
Never.

613
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,374
What I want to know is

614
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,166
did you see Mrs. Allen on
the night of November the 5th?

615
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:09,208
Indeed I did.

616
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,541
You called at her house,
I think.

617
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,874
That's right.

618
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,874
She asked me to advise her
about some investments.

619
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,791
She gave no hint about
contemplating suicide?

620
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,291
Not the least in the world.

621
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,541
As a matter of fact,
when we said goodbye,

622
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,291
I said I'd ring her up soon
and we'd do a show together.

623
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,083
You said you'd ring her up?

624
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:28,416
Those were your last words?

625
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,666
Yes.

626
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:30,999
Curious.

627
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,583
I have information that you said
something quite different.

628
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:37,791
My information is that
what you actually said was,

629
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,041
"Well, think it over
and let me know."

630
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,666
Not quite the same thing, is it?

631
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,708
Well, I -- I-I think what I said

632
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,916
was that she should let me know
when she was free.

633
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,666
I mean, you can't expect a man
to remember word for word.

634
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,083
Excuse me, Major.

635
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,458
Deirdre says we need some more
gin from the cupboard.

636
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,374
Ah.

637
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:01,374
Get a couple of bottles out,
will you, Trevor?

638
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,541
Right.

639
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,499
You own this place,
do you, Major Eustace?

640
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,541
Wish I did.

641
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,166
Little gold mine, this.

642
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,166
You say that Mrs. Allen
asked you to advise her

643
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:20,749
about investments.

644
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:24,041
Did she, by any chance,
entrust you with a sum of £200?

645
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:26,958
What the devil
do you mean by that?

646
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,166
Well, Mrs. Allen drew out
the sum of £200 in cash

647
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:31,624
from her bank.

648
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,624
Some of the money
was in £5 notes.

649
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:36,166
They can be traced
by their numbers, of course.

650
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,833
Well, trace them, then,
and be damned to you!

651
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:45,958
Trace them.

652
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,249
I don't care.

653
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,541
Was the money for investment,
Major Eustace,

654
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,624
or was it blackmail?

655
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,124
That's a preposterous
suggestion.

656
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,541
How dare you?

657
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,083
Look -- Look --
what happened was this --

658
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,458
I went 'round to the house.

659
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,208
I mean, I-I telephoned first --

660
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,791
What time did you get there?

661
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,666
Um... about half past 9:00.

662
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:09,333
We sat and talked.

663
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:10,958
And smoked.

664
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,166
Yes, and smoked.

665
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:13,624
Anything wrong with that?

666
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,499
Where did this talk take place?

667
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:16,916
In the sitting room.

668
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,499
As I said, we sat and talked
quite amicably.

669
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,666
And then I left, uh, just before
about half past 10:00.

670
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,333
You stayed in the sitting room
throughout your visit?

671
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,708
Yes.

672
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,499
You didn't go upstairs
to Mrs. Allen's own room?

673
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:31,666
No.

674
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,166
Could I just look at your
cuff links, Major Eustace?

675
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,458
Cuff links?

676
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,708
You can refuse if you wish,
of course.

677
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,291
I've got nothing to hide.

678
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,874
When did that happen?

679
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,874
-What?
-One of them's broken.

680
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,124
Oh, I know.

681
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,166
I, uh -- I noticed it
this morning.

682
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,499
It doesn't show if I put
that end on the inside.

683
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:58,708
Would it surprise you to learn

684
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,833
that it happened when you were
visiting Mrs. Allen?

685
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,874
Well, I've not denied
I was there.

686
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,749
Yes, but that piece of cuff link

687
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,374
was found not downstairs
in the sitting room,

688
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,249
but upstairs
in Mrs. Allen's own room,

689
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,958
there in the same room
where she was murdered.

690
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,833
Murdered?

691
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,624
Yes, and where a man sat smoking

692
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,333
the same kind of cigarettes
that you smoke.

693
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,041
Are you trying to frame me?

694
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,833
I never went near the house
again that night.

695
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,041
You didn't need to.
She was dead when you left.

696
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,166
No.

697
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:30,624
No, now, wait a minute.

698
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:31,749
Wait a minute.

699
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,499
You've got someone who heard me
talking to Barbara

700
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,541
on the doorstep.

701
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,708
You said --

702
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,291
They heard you talk to her,

703
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,458
then pretend to wait for her
to answer, and then talk again.

704
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:41,624
That's an old trick.

705
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:44,833
Oh, my God, it isn't true.

706
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,624
Robert Erskine Eustace,

707
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,666
I must ask you to accompany me
to the police station.

708
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,083
Oh, my God.

709
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:10,708
Oh, hello.

710
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:12,166
Yes, dear?

711
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,874
Could I please speak
to Miss Plenderleith?

712
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,708
Well, you could, dear,
if she was here.

713
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,874
She's gone off playing
that golf.

714
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,083
Golf?

715
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:22,208
If you please.

716
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:25,874
And that poor Mrs. Allen still
lying cold down at the mortuary.

717
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,749
Indeed.

718
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,416
This is most difficult.

719
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:32,666
I'm sorry.
Missus...

720
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,958
Pierce, dear.

721
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:34,999
Ah.

722
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,041
My name is Hercule Poirot,
Mrs. Pierce.

723
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,083
Ooh!

724
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,041
I've heard of you, dear.

725
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,874
Well, I am most flattered.

726
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,208
Mrs. Pierce, I am in something
of a difficulty.

727
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,791
Oh.

728
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,999
I came here yesterday
with a Chief Inspector Japp,

729
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,041
and we omitted to search
for clues

730
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,249
in one particular place
in the house.

731
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,708
So, I was wondering if --

732
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,333
Oh, come on in, dear.

733
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,416
Help yourself.

734
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,916
You are most kind.

735
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,208
Thank you.

736
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,999
My old man will be
ever so tickled

737
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,166
when I tell him you was here,
dear.

738
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,958
Always reading your exploits
in the paper, he is.

739
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,083
That's very nice, Mrs. Pierce.
May I?

740
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,458
Yes, go on.

741
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,541
Drive you to drink, he would,

742
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:24,916
reading all that rubbish
in the newspapers.

743
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,041
Mrs. Pierce,

744
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:36,041
where does Miss Plenderleith go
to play the golf?

745
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,708
Are you sure he's all right,
Captain Hastings?

746
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,083
The name of Poirot is feared

747
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,666
on golf courses
all over the continent.

748
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,541
You don't happen to have
a handicap certificate on you,

749
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,624
do you, sir?

750
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,999
No, no, I'm fine.

751
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,583
Now, there should be
a little hole somewhere,

752
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,874
and I have to push the ball
into it.

753
00:39:04,417 --> 00:39:07,291
You see that flag there?

754
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,166
No.

755
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,874
In front of the big tree,
a little patch of red.

756
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,333
Ah, yes, good.

757
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,249
That's where the little hole is.

758
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:17,458
No.

759
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,458
Won't keep you a moment.

760
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:26,666
Now, all you have to do
is hit it with that.

761
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,291
Go ahead.

762
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,124
Easy does it.

763
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,666
Am I allowed to hit the flag?

764
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,833
Oh, yes, yes, that'll be fine.

765
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,749
No, it will not hit the flag,
I think.

766
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:11,458
Oh.
Bad luck.

767
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,749
Hastings, how will we ever
catch up with Miss Plenderleith

768
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,791
if you take so many hits
each time?

769
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,874
Well, we can't.

770
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,124
She started out
an hour and a half ago.

771
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:26,416
We might see her coming back
on one of the parallel holes.

772
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,999
I do wish you'd stop rummaging
around in the dustbins.

773
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,416
Ha.

774
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,791
Not another one.

775
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:40,874
Number three, Hastings.

776
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,624
Someone's having a bad day.

777
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,333
People do break clubs, you know.

778
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,208
But three clubs in three holes?

779
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,874
Well, what, then?

780
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,999
Our Miss Plenderleith is getting
rid of some golf clubs

781
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:55,083
in a place where she thought
they would never be noticed.

782
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:04,583
Major Eustace is not guilty
of murder, Hastings.

783
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,083
Lost your ball again, Poirot?

784
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,749
Shh!
Keep out of sight.

785
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,958
Look.

786
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,749
Have you seen enough, Hastings?

787
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,291
I must regretfully abandon
our most interesting game

788
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,083
and go and telephone
the Chief Inspector Japp.

789
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:38,583
Come on.

790
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,291
Why?

791
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,249
Why would a presumably sane
young woman

792
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,583
want to throw an expensive case
into a lake

793
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,166
with just two magazines in it

794
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:11,541
and a couple of stones
to make sure it sank?

795
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,166
You need worry no longer.

796
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,333
The answer is coming.

797
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:18,458
And why break up a perfectly
good set of golf clubs?

798
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:20,916
I don't mind telling you
I lay awake last night

799
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:21,958
worrying about it.

800
00:43:22,084 --> 00:43:23,333
Mon pauvre Japp.

801
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:25,499
Miss Plenderleith, Mr. Poirot.

802
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,916
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

803
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:29,874
I'm sorry I'm late.

804
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,249
I've just come
from Barbara's funeral.

805
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,958
It was so good of you to come.

806
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:38,208
Please sit down, mademoiselle.

807
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,541
I have certain news to give you.

808
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,999
I read it in the papers.

809
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,791
Major Eustace has been arrested.

810
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,708
It was murder, then?

811
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:55,083
Oh, yes, the willful destruction
of one human being

812
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:00,083
by another human being.

813
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,041
And now, mademoiselle,
I am going to tell you

814
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:07,166
just how I arrived at the truth
in this matter.

815
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,041
He has his methods.

816
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,458
I humor him, you know.

817
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:16,083
To begin with, there was the
smell of the cigarette smoke.

818
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:18,166
Which I didn't smell.

819
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,458
Precisely.

820
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:21,124
And yet the ashtray had in it

821
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,791
no fewer than the stubs
of nine cigarettes.

822
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,624
So it was very odd, eh, very odd

823
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,666
that the room should smell
as it did -- perfectly fresh.

824
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,208
Oh, so that's what
you were getting at.

825
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:32,291
Hmm?

826
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,791
The next thing
that attracted my attention

827
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:37,333
was the wristwatch worn
by the dead woman.

828
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:38,958
What about it?

829
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,916
It was worn on the right wrist.

830
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:44,374
In my experience,
it is more usual

831
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,666
for the wristwatch to be worn
on the left wrist.

832
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,208
But now, my friends,
I come to the writing bureau.

833
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,416
Yes, I thought we'd come
to that.

834
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,458
You know the blotting pad
had on top

835
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,291
a clean, untouched
piece of blotting paper?

836
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:01,416
The sheet was clean

837
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:04,291
because Barbara hadn't written
any letters that day.

838
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:05,791
Yes, she had.

839
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:08,333
Freddie saw her post
some letters at 6:00.

840
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:09,874
Well done, Hastings.

841
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,374
So, what, then,
happened to the piece of paper

842
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,541
on which she had blotted
her letters?

843
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:19,833
But there was a second curious
detail about the writing desk.

844
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:24,916
Perhaps you, Japp, can remember
the arrangement of it.

845
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,583
Allow me.

846
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,083
Ink stand and blotting pad
in the center,

847
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,374
the pen tray to the left,

848
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,124
the calendar and the quill pen
to the right.

849
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,333
Eh bien?

850
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:45,708
Yes.

851
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:47,708
Ah, you do not see?

852
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,416
The pens for use were in
the pen tray on the left.

853
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,208
Is it not more usual to find
the pen tray on the right

854
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:59,166
more convenient
for the right hand?

855
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,749
So I made myself a picture,
Japp.

856
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:10,499
A picture of Miss Plenderleith
arriving home

857
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,999
after the weekend.

858
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,916
A picture of Miss Plenderleith
opening the door

859
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,874
and finding her friend
lying dead,

860
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,083
with the pistol clasped
in her hand.

861
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:26,458
Barbara?

862
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,458
Her left hand, naturally,

863
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,291
since her friend was
left-handed,

864
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,791
in spite of everything
Miss Plenderleith has done

865
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,708
to convince us that her friend
was right-handed.

866
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:41,958
There is also a note addressed
to you, mademoiselle.

867
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,208
It was, I fancy,
a very moving letter

868
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,999
about a young, gentle,
unhappy woman...

869
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,958
driven by blackmail
to take her own life.

870
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:59,416
I think almost at once the idea
flashed into your head --

871
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,499
"Let him be punished."

872
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:07,874
You take up the note, and the
top sheet of blotting paper.

873
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:11,374
Then you go downstairs
and light the fire...

874
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:16,374
...and drop both
into the flames.

875
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:25,374
You take the ashtray upstairs
to further the illusion

876
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:29,166
that there were two people
sat up there talking.

877
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:33,124
You also have a lucky break.

878
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,708
You discover a fragment

879
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:38,624
of Major Eustace's cuff link
in the sitting room.

880
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:40,624
You take that upstairs, too.

881
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,208
You expect that
to clinch the matter.

882
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,249
You take the pistol
from her left hand.

883
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,916
You wipe it clean and put it
back in her left hand.

884
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,708
You bolt the window
and lock the door.

885
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:18,666
There must be no suspicion that
you have tampered with the room.

886
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,874
And so it goes on.

887
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,708
Oh, yes, mademoiselle,
it was clever,

888
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,874
a very clever murder.

889
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,916
For that is what it was.

890
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:42,749
The attempted murder
of Major Eustace.

891
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:46,208
It wasn't murder.

892
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,166
It was justice.

893
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,583
That man hounded Barbara
to her death -- poor kid --

894
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:57,791
just because she got involved
with some married man in India

895
00:48:57,917 --> 00:48:59,166
and had a baby.

896
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,333
When the child died,
she came back to England.

897
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,833
She met Charles
and fell in love with him.

898
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:10,291
God knows why,
the pompous little tick.

899
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:14,458
And then that devil Eustace
turned up from India.

900
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,999
If you'd read that letter
she left me,

901
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,083
you'd understand
why I did what I did.

902
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,916
She loved Charles, she said.

903
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,374
She couldn't live without him,

904
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:27,083
but for his own sake,
she mustn't marry him.

905
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,666
She was taking the best way out.

906
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:31,874
I wish you'd seen that letter.

907
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,499
And you call it murder!

908
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,583
Because it is murder.

909
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:41,583
The man you wish to trap
is already in prison.

910
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,333
Do you really wish
to destroy him?

911
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,333
Do you really wish to destroy
the life,

912
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:54,166
the mind of any human being?

913
00:49:58,584 --> 00:49:59,833
No.

914
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,749
No, I don't.

915
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,958
I wish I did.

916
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:08,958
But I don't.

917
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:23,416
Well, I'm jiggered.

918
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,624
Not murder disguised as suicide,

919
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:32,999
but suicide made to look
like murder.

920
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,499
And cleverly done, too.

921
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,249
Nothing overemphasized.

922
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:41,874
Wait a minute.

923
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,666
What about the briefcase?

924
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:45,874
And what about the golf clubs?

925
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,499
Ah.

926
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,416
Well, they were Mrs. Allen's.

927
00:50:50,709 --> 00:50:51,958
You see, Jane Plenderleith

928
00:50:52,084 --> 00:50:54,583
had to convince us that
her friend was right-handed

929
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:57,166
if we were to believe
she had been murdered.

930
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:00,666
But the golf clubs --
they were the left-handed.

931
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,291
Of course!

932
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:05,541
And when she opened
the cupboard,

933
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,666
she tried to focus our attention
on the wrong object.

934
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,708
So she used the briefcase
as a --

935
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,208
What is it, a bloater?
Kipper?

936
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:14,791
Red herring.

937
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,166
Absolutely.

938
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:18,458
And now, my friends,

939
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,499
it is time for me to take you
to lunch.
