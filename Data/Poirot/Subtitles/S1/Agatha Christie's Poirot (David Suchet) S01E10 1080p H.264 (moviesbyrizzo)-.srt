1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,958
British pies are famous
the world over,

2
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,666
and last year, Farley's Foods
produced five million of them,

3
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,999
everything from
steak-and-kidney

4
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,874
to Cornish pasties.

5
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,249
But that's not enough
for old man Farley.

6
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,416
He wants to double the score.

7
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,333
Work's been pushing ahead

8
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,291
on the new extension
to his factory,

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,166
and this week,
the great day dawns.

10
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:10,208
My friends --

11
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:14,666
I hope I may call you
my friends.

12
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:20,374
After all, I pay your wages.

13
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,291
In 1935, we sold more pies

14
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,583
than at any time in our history.

15
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,541
Yet there are those among you,
politically motivated,

16
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,458
who still try to say
that you are not doing well.

17
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:52,791
Don't listen to them.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,041
And now let us move on
to happier things.

19
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,999
Once more
I stand before you here

20
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:13,041
to open yet another new wing
of our great enterprise.

21
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,291
Joanna.

22
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,791
Why didn't you call me
yesterday?

23
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,291
You mustn't come here.

24
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,666
I've got to see you.

25
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,999
It's no good, Joanna.

26
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,916
What isn't?
What do you mean?

27
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,416
I've been given
two weeks' notice.

28
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,833
By my father?

29
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,208
Well, not directly, but, yes.

30
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,208
Why?

31
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,791
Because he's found out about us,
of course.

32
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,874
I've got to go.

33
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,666
Oh, God.

34
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,458
"I'd like to think
that it's been a partnership,

35
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,624
a partnership
between the Farley family

36
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:26,583
and we humble mortals
in the municipality."

37
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,749
There are other jobs, Herbert.

38
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,124
Not with your father's
bad opinion following me

39
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,124
wherever I go.

40
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,416
I could kill him!

41
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,124
I could really kill him!

42
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:42,166
Talking like that
doesn't do any good.

43
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:51,708
A-And now it gives me
great pleasure

44
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:57,499
to declare this new wing
well and truly open.

45
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,708
Bother.

46
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:52,749
"This is your chance."

47
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,833
What?

48
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,583
"This is your chance
to invest in a pair

49
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,999
of Home Phit
real leather shoes."

50
00:06:59,209 --> 00:06:59,999
Oh, that's clever.

51
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,208
"Fit" spelled with a "P-H."

52
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:03,749
"Just return this card,

53
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,583
and our representatives
will call on you."

54
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,499
Made-to-measure shoes,
apparently.

55
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,416
Seem awfully reasonable.

56
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,541
Don't suppose they have any
made-to-measure typewriters

57
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,791
in there, have they?

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,458
Sorry?

59
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,333
Ever since last Easter,

60
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,208
I've been asking Mr. Poirot
for a new typewriter.

61
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:26,624
Mr. Poirot isn't mean,
but he is careful.

62
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,958
He found this typewriter
in the flat when he moved in.

63
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,291
Someone had left it.

64
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,041
Jolly useful.

65
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,749
Hmm.

66
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,416
Who's Benedict Farley?

67
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,874
No idea.

68
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,666
Oh, isn't he Farley's pies?

69
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,666
Pies?

70
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,916
Why?

71
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,374
"Dear, sir, Mr. Benedict Farley

72
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,666
would like to have the benefit
of your advice.

73
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,083
If convenient to yourself,

74
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,499
he would be glad
if you would call upon him

75
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,666
at the above address

76
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,749
at 9:30 tomorrow,
Thursday evening.

77
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,916
Yours truly,
Hugo Cornworthy, Secretary.

78
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,374
P.S. Please bring this letter
with you."

79
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,666
Repeat that, if you please,
Hastings.

80
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,041
"Dear sir --"

81
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,416
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

82
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,999
Just the postscript.

83
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:20,291
"P.S. Please bring this letter
with you."

84
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,999
Why?

85
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:28,666
Why, Hastings?

86
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,374
An interesting letter.

87
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:32,958
Is it?

88
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,874
I thought it was rather dull.

89
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:36,791
Miss Lemon says he makes pies.

90
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,249
Makes pies?

91
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,791
Hastings, to say
that Benedict Farley makes pies

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,999
is like saying
that Wagner wrote semiquavers.

93
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,416
They're good pies, are they?

94
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:53,708
No, horrible, but there are
a great many of them.

95
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,958
The fonts and oracle of Benedict
Farley's wealth, I surmise, eh?

96
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,499
And that, Hastings,

97
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,333
is where he makes his sausages,
his pies, his hams.

98
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,166
Useful, eh,
living above the shop?

99
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,833
I suppose from here Farley likes
to keep an eye on his employees.

100
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,583
No doubt, but it is a pity
that such diligence

101
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:52,916
does not improve the quality
of his so-called delectables.

102
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,666
Good evening.

103
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,833
Good evening, sir.

104
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:06,083
M. Poirot and Captain Hastings
to see Mr. Farley.

105
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,333
I'm sorry, sir.

106
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,166
I was instructed to admit
only one.

107
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,666
Oh, come, now.

108
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,499
I was instructed
most positively, sir.

109
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,874
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,124
You know,
this is most inconvenient.

111
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,166
You'll excuse me, sir.
I was told to ask for a letter.

112
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,624
Pardon?

113
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,291
Oh, yes, uh...

114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,124
Ah.

115
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,583
Thank you, sir.

116
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,041
Yeah?

117
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,208
The gentleman you are expecting,
sir.

118
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,208
Oh.

119
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,666
You're Hercule Poirot, eh?

120
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,833
Monsieur.

121
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,333
Sit down.

122
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,416
Sit down.

123
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,874
Merci, m-monsieur.

124
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,416
What is it that you wish to
consult me about, M. Farley?

125
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:44,208
I have the same dream,
night after night.

126
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,666
I'm sitting in my room
next to this,

127
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,333
sitting at my desk, writing.

128
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,999
There's a clock in there.

129
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,499
I look up at it.

130
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,833
I see the time.

131
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:06,583
It is exactly 28 minutes
past 12:00,

132
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,083
always the same time.

133
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,416
You understand?

134
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:17,124
When I see that time, Poirot,
I know I've got to do it.

135
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:20,999
At 28 minutes past 12:00,

136
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:26,874
I open the second drawer down
on the right of my desk.

137
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,499
I take out a revolver,

138
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,999
I load it,

139
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,166
and I go over to the window.

140
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,249
And then?

141
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,208
I shoot myself.

142
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:47,958
I just lift the gun to my head

143
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,749
and shoot myself.

144
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,124
What do you make of that?

145
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:04,208
I've already consulted
a specialist in Harley Street.

146
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,333
And what does this specialist
tell you?

147
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:10,041
He was preposterous!

148
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,833
He asserted my life
is so unbearable to me,

149
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,874
I deliberately want to end it.

150
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,791
He is a fool.

151
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,624
Why should I
want to kill myself?

152
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,666
One of the richest men
in the country,

153
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,833
I have everything
I could possibly want.

154
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,999
I am a happy man.

155
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,249
Mm.

156
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,166
So, where do I come in,
M. Farley?

157
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,916
Supposing someone
wants to kill me.

158
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,374
Could they do it this way?

159
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,791
Hypnotism, you mean?

160
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,708
You see what I'm getting at.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,416
Who is it that you suspect of
wanting to kill you, monsieur?

162
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,958
Nobody, nobody at all.

163
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,583
You had no one specific in mind?

164
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:08,583
Certainly not.

165
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,291
Ah.

166
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,374
I should like to see
the scene of this drama --

167
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,583
the desk, the clock,
the revolver --

168
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:18,666
No.

169
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,249
I've told you all there is
to tell.

170
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,791
There's nothing to see
next door.

171
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,583
Nevertheless, I should like
to see for myself --

172
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:24,708
There is no need.

173
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:28,916
I just want your opinion.

174
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,999
But I can hardly have an opinion
on such skimpy evidence.

175
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,541
There's an end of it, then.

176
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,666
I've told you the facts.
You can't make anything of it.

177
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,249
That closes the matter.

178
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,374
You can send me in your bill
for the consultation fee.

179
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:58,708
I shall not fail to do so.

180
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,083
Wait.

181
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:10,083
That letter -- I want it.

182
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,833
The letter from your secretary?

183
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,124
Yes.

184
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,708
Ah.

185
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,124
Mm.

186
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,541
Thank you.

187
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,124
Oh.
A thousand pardons, monsieur.

188
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,166
What?

189
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,333
I have committed a folly, eh?

190
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:49,708
The letter I handed to you
just now --

191
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,083
it was a letter
from my landlord.

192
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,166
This is your letter.

193
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,333
Why the devil can't you watch
what you're doing?

194
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,541
Ah.

195
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,666
Au revoir, monsieur.

196
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,374
How'd you get on in there?

197
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:33,666
Ah.

198
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,958
Not well, I'm afraid.

199
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:42,499
There is something wrong in that
house, Hastings, badly wrong.

200
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,874
And I haven't the faintest idea
what it is.

201
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,749
Get off, boy.

202
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,083
I want these documents
in Leadenhall Street by 1:00.

203
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,374
Well, go on, then!

204
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,791
Run!

205
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,583
Uh, excuse me, sir.

206
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,874
Mr. Cornworthy said
you might spare us a moment.

207
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:47,124
Hmm?

208
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,166
What's going on?

209
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,583
12:00, he said.

210
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,791
All right, all right.

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,916
He's a very busy man.

212
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,541
Now, let's just sit down.

213
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,124
And relax.

214
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,166
Mr. Cornworthy.

215
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,791
Mr. Tremlett,
are you still here?

216
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
We've been here an hour, nearly.

217
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,166
Over an hour.

218
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,916
Well, I'll go and see
what he's up to.

219
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,166
He's got to sign these, anyway.

220
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,291
Bloody nerve.

221
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,583
That's our dinner hour gone.
I know that.

222
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,374
He'll see us now.

223
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,874
Good God!

224
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,416
For God's sake, someone...

225
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,916
send for the police!

226
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,999
I can't go on like this,
Mr. Poirot.

227
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,291
That machine is more than
flesh and blood can stand.

228
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,583
But you have never complained
before.

229
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,333
I've done nothing but complain
for the last six months.

230
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,833
No.

231
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,499
It has been mentioned, Poirot.

232
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:19,083
Kindly do not band together
against Poirot.

233
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,083
I wasn't.

234
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,791
Do I not do my best
to keep us all happy?

235
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,541
I don't want to be happy.

236
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,249
I just want to --

237
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,166
Poirot.

238
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,416
Ah, Inspector Japp,
my old friend.

239
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,166
I'm at Northway House, Poirot,
Benedict Farley's place.

240
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,249
I'd like you to come over here
if you'd be so kind.

241
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:44,791
Mr. Farley has shot himself.

242
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,416
Most peculiar story
I ever heard.

243
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,291
I've never heard such poppycock.

244
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,041
Father had no use for dreams
and such rubbish.

245
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,999
Nevertheless,
that is what he told me.

246
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,666
Yes, he -- he mentioned it
to me.

247
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,791
It upset him very much.

248
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,833
I told him it was indigestion,
I'm afraid.

249
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:09,041
I suggested his calling in
Dr. Stillingfleet.

250
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,291
He never did.

251
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,583
From M. Poirot's story, I gather
he went to Harley Street.

252
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,666
Mm.

253
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,666
Yes, he told me he consulted
a specialist,

254
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,499
but is it known
who this specialist was?

255
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:23,999
None of us had any idea
that he'd consulted anyone.

256
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,749
And he never spoke to you
about the dream?

257
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,291
No.

258
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,999
And you, M. Cornworthy?

259
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:36,166
No, he said nothing about it
at all.

260
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,166
I took down a letter to you
at his dictation,

261
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,333
but I have no idea
why he wanted to consult you.

262
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,374
I thought it might have
something to do

263
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,749
with some business irregularity.

264
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,708
Hmm. I see.

265
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,083
Inspector Japp, can you tell me

266
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:58,999
the events leading up to
the death of M. Benedict Farley?

267
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,666
Well, Mr. Farley had agreed
to see two representatives

268
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,666
from the works.

269
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,499
There was
a proposal for forming a union.

270
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:07,999
Some hoped.

271
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,291
Yes, quite so.

272
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,541
A little before 1:00,

273
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,958
Mr. Cornworthy here came
out of his room

274
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,749
and went in to Mr. Farley.

275
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,833
He couldn't see him at first
and thought the room was empty.

276
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,833
Then he caught sight of a boot
sticking out

277
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,208
from behind the desk.

278
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,708
And what happened then?

279
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,999
I ran out of the room,

280
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,166
and I told the butler
to call Dr. Stillingfleet.

281
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,624
And... he did.

282
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,416
The body was found down there.

283
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,374
Thank you.

284
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:06,458
At what time did he die, Doctor?

285
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,083
I examined the body
at 32 minutes past 1:00.

286
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,666
Mr. Farley had been dead
at least one hour.

287
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,833
So, he could have died at this
12:28 he told you about.

288
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,208
Precisely.

289
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,833
Were there any fingerprints
on the revolver?

290
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:20,833
Only his own.

291
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,624
And please tell me
about the revolver itself.

292
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:26,499
Well, it was the one he kept
in the drawer of his desk,

293
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,958
again, just as he told you.

294
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,166
Mrs. Farley has identified it
positively.

295
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,291
I see.

296
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,999
What's more, that's the only
entrance to the room.

297
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,916
Well, apart from the windows,
I suppose.

298
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,541
I cannot see how anybody
could climb up there.

299
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,083
It's a funny room for a rich man
to choose as his study,

300
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,333
isn't it,

301
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:03,791
with that great ugly blank wall
right outside?

302
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,166
I think it is important,
that wall.

303
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,749
You mean psychologically?

304
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,999
Perhaps.

305
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:18,291
At 28 minutes past 12:00,

306
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,916
I open the second drawer
down on the right of my desk.

307
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:30,708
I take out a revolver... load it.

308
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:36,249
I go over to the window.

309
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:39,458
And then?

310
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,083
And then I shoot myself.

311
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:50,041
I just lift the gun
to my head...

312
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,166
and shoot myself.

313
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,958
I should not have thought

314
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,458
that there is any reason
for you to doubt

315
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,749
the accuracy of the dream's
prediction, Inspector.

316
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,916
In fact, there is every reason
to suggest

317
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,333
that Benedict Farley
committed suicide.

318
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,499
Well, there would have been
no doubt about it at all,

319
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,666
but for one point.

320
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,416
And what was that?

321
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,624
The letter written to you.

322
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,833
Ah, I see.

323
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,083
So, where Hercule Poirot
is concerned,

324
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,833
there arises immediately
the suspicion of murder?

325
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,458
Precisely.

326
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:52,208
Touché.

327
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,874
Hello, M. Poirot.

328
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,458
Fancy your chances?

329
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,666
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

330
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,541
Thank you very much,
mademoiselle,

331
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,291
but essentially Hercule Poirot
is, uh, a man of peace.

332
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,208
But perhaps, though,
I could ask you a few questions.

333
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,416
Ask away.

334
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,624
Did you know that your father
kept a revolver in his desk?

335
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:07,791
No.

336
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,499
Ah.

337
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,624
Where were you
and your mother -- Ah, pardon.

338
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,166
That is to say,
your stepmother --

339
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,833
That is correct?

340
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,499
Yes, Louise is
my father's second wife.

341
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,458
She's only eight years older
than I am.

342
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:27,208
So, where were you and she
on Thursday night of last week?

343
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,166
Thursday.

344
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,249
We went to the theater
to see "Thumbs Up."

345
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,666
And your father did not suggest
accompanying you?

346
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,666
He never went out to theaters.

347
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,291
He was not a very sociable man?

348
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,624
My father had a singularly
unpleasant personality.

349
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,416
That is a very candid statement,
mademoiselle.

350
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,541
I'm saving you time, M. Poirot.

351
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,666
I realize quite well
what you're getting at.

352
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,416
I live here because I have
no money to live elsewhere.

353
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,874
There is a man that I wish
to marry -- a poor man.

354
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,499
My father saw to it
that he lost his job.

355
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:04,083
He wanted me, you see,
to marry well --

356
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,624
an easy matter
since I was his heiress.

357
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,166
So, your father's fortune passes
to you?

358
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,208
Yes.

359
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:13,624
Well, that is to say,
he left Louise, my stepmother,

360
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,083
£250,000 free of tax,

361
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:17,624
and there are other
few small legacies,

362
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,833
but the residue of it
goes to me.

363
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,624
So, you see, M. Poirot,

364
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,166
I had every reason to desire
my father's death.

365
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,958
I see, also, mademoiselle,

366
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,041
that you have inherited
your father's intelligence.

367
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,999
Father was clever.

368
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:35,791
But yet it all turned sour.

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,874
There was no humanity left.

370
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,958
Is there anything more?

371
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,541
Yes.

372
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:49,541
How poor
was your father's eyesight?

373
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,166
He could scarcely see at all,
and not without his glasses.

374
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,291
His sight had always been bad,
from a boy.

375
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,624
But with his glasses?

376
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,249
Oh, he could see all right then,
of course.

377
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:01,999
Thank you.

378
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,916
All right, Constable,
tell Sergeant Ball

379
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,624
this is gonna take longer
than expected.

380
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:07,833
Right, sir.

381
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,166
Ah, Mrs. Farley.

382
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,624
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

383
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,708
Yes?

384
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,833
Had your husband
ever been hypnotized?

385
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:20,041
Never, to my knowledge.

386
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,791
Was he interested in that sort
of thing -- hypnotism?

387
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,999
No.

388
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,166
Oh, that horrible dream.

389
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:30,666
It's uncanny, to dream that same
awful dream, night after night.

390
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,208
It's as though he were hounded
to his death.

391
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:36,374
Had it ever occurred to you

392
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,124
that your husband might be
tempted to do away with himself?

393
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,416
No.

394
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,124
Well, sometimes he --
he was rather queer.

395
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:45,291
Poppycock.

396
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,416
Father was far too fond of
himself ever to commit suicide.

397
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,666
You don't know everything,
Joanna.

398
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,374
I know that much.

399
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,374
Pardon, Mme. Farley.

400
00:28:57,584 --> 00:29:01,874
How many pairs of glasses
did your husband own?

401
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:02,916
Glasses?

402
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,499
Uh, well, spectacles.

403
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,666
I have no idea -- three, four?

404
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,499
Ah.

405
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,791
Hmm. Thank you.

406
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,708
Come in.

407
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:29,041
Ah, mon Dieu, how different
this room looks in daylight.

408
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,416
Can I do something for you?

409
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,041
Ah, and I see, monsieur,

410
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,708
that you share
the same inspiring view

411
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:38,249
as your late employer.

412
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,458
Oh, yes.

413
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,541
On the other side of that wall

414
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,833
are the fools who made
Mr. Farley's wealth for him.

415
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:50,583
I think that's why he chose
to have his study

416
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:51,999
this side of the house.

417
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,249
I see.

418
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,541
You know, I feel sure,
if that wall could talk,

419
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,333
it would tell us something, no?

420
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,333
Mm.

421
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:13,583
M. Cornworthy, when I arrived
last Thursday evening,

422
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:17,499
I was not shown
into M. Farley's own room.

423
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,416
No.

424
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:23,458
I was told to tell Holmes
to show you in here.

425
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,999
Why was that, do you think?

426
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,541
I never questioned
any of Mr. Farley's orders.

427
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,874
No, no, no, no.

428
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,583
Did he usually receive
the visitors in here?

429
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:41,833
Quite often...

430
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,999
particularly if people hadn't
come to the house before.

431
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,958
I see. Mm.

432
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,541
Thank you, M. Cornworthy.

433
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:09,249
Inspector, this dream
of Benedict Farley

434
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:10,916
is very important.

435
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,666
He dreamed, he said,
of committing suicide.

436
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:17,666
And later on,
he did commit suicide.

437
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,708
Now, when I say "suicide,"

438
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,624
he was alone in his room

439
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,624
and was found with a gun
in his hand.

440
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:28,291
And no one entered or left the
room at the time he was shot.

441
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,916
So, what does this mean,
Chief Inspector?

442
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,458
Well, that there's
no other possibility --

443
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,874
that it must be suicide.

444
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,041
Au contraire.

445
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,041
It means a very unusual

446
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,291
and very cleverly planned
murder.

447
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:47,124
Planned how?
Planned by who?

448
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,874
Well, it is no good, is it,
Chief Inspector,

449
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,333
if I just give you the answer?

450
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,624
Well --

451
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,333
No.

452
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:59,374
We must give the little gray
cells time to do their work, eh?

453
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:11,291
And give Poirot time to work out
who did it and how.

454
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,333
This is not like you, Poirot.

455
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:40,874
Well, this is not like
the gray cells, Hastings!

456
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,249
I have given them every chance.

457
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,624
They have been cosseted.

458
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,166
I have slept to allow them
to do their work.

459
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,916
I have eaten fish for breakfast.

460
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,624
Result -- nothing!

461
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:54,708
It'll come, Poirot.

462
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:57,416
The little gray cells
have never let you down yet.

463
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,416
Ah.

464
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:02,083
But is this not an indication,
perhaps, of what is in store?

465
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:07,083
A sign that they are weakened
by old age and the fast living?

466
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,666
Fast living, Poirot?

467
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,666
I wouldn't call your life
exactly fast.

468
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:16,374
Well, not now, perhaps,
Hastings, but... in my youth.

469
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,208
Really?

470
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,999
Oh.

471
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,708
Really?

472
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,708
You see, one pays, Hastings.

473
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:30,124
Eventually, one is called to
settle one's account.

474
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:31,583
I say.

475
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,708
Oh.

476
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,874
I shall have another tisane.

477
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,291
Bother!

478
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,541
Mr. Poirot, I --

479
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,541
What is it, Mr. Poirot?

480
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,666
Another tisane,
if you please, Miss Lemon.

481
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,874
Oh, dear.

482
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,499
You had your 9:00 one.

483
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:12,416
Well, serious measures
are called for, Miss Lemon.

484
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:22,291
Mon Dieu.

485
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,999
Do you have the time, please,
Miss Lemon?

486
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,833
Of course, Mr. Poirot.

487
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,958
Ah.

488
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:36,458
What are you doing, Miss Lemon?

489
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,458
It's 5 to 10:00, Mr. Poirot.

490
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,874
But what were you doing
out there?

491
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,458
If I lean right out,
I can just see the church clock.

492
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,374
But would it not be simpler
to wear the watch?

493
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,541
I can't, M. Poirot.

494
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,041
My magnetism upsets them.

495
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,083
I say.

496
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:53,499
All my life, I've been looking
for a watch that won't go wild

497
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:56,749
as soon as I put it on,
but I've never met it.

498
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,791
What ever is the matter,
Mr. Poirot?

499
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,666
Miss Lemon, you are beautiful.

500
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,541
Now, would you please be so kind

501
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,416
as to telephone
the Chief Inspector Japp

502
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,041
and ask him to assemble the
whole Farley household at noon?

503
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,041
In the hall, hein?

504
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,958
Come, Hastings.
We have work to do.

505
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,208
All has become clear.

506
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:27,541
Then they're brought in here
from the pastry room

507
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,624
and loaded into the ovens.

508
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:33,624
The ovens have got to be sealed
and closed by 12:15

509
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,249
because we start the bake
at 12:30 sharp.

510
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,749
If we hadn't done that,

511
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,666
Mr. Farley was on the telephone

512
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,541
quicker than you can say
"three little piggies."

513
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,041
Did he come regularly
to the factory?

514
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,291
Oh, no.

515
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,124
No, he hadn't done that

516
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,874
for, uh --
oh, six or seven years.

517
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,416
Well, not regularly,

518
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:57,208
but he seemed to know if we
hadn't started the bake on time.

519
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:00,208
In the office, we used to say
he had second sight

520
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,749
as far as a pork pie
was concerned.

521
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,291
But that was just
by way of a joke.

522
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,708
Then after the bake,

523
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,249
which takes
about an hour and half,

524
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,583
we take them out of the ovens,

525
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,916
and then they go
around the corner...

526
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,333
Now, remember what I told you.

527
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,499
Yes.

528
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,874
Is it loaded?

529
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,541
Oh, yes.

530
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,749
Here he comes.

531
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:08,833
Bonjour.

532
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:33,958
I wonder -- what is
the most extraordinary thing

533
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,666
about this case, hmm?

534
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,874
Well, the dream, I'd say.

535
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:43,374
If we hadn't got your word
for it, Poirot --

536
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:47,999
Exactement. The telling
of the dream was vital.

537
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:52,583
But, mes amis, there is more
to it than that.

538
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:57,499
Where did this telling
of the dream take place?

539
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:02,541
M. Benedict Farley received me
here in his secretary's room

540
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,416
and refused, point-blank,
to let me see into his own room,

541
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,958
just a few feet away.

542
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,624
Why did he do that, hein?

543
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,916
Because there was something
in that room

544
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,999
he could not afford
to have me see.

545
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,291
What?

546
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,958
We will come to that.

547
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,791
When M. Benedict Farley asked me
to return his letter to him,

548
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,124
by inadvertence, I handed to him
the correspondence

549
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,333
from my landlord.

550
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:31,958
One glance should have told him
it was a wrong letter.

551
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,791
Didn't he have his glasses on?

552
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,708
Oh, yes, he had on his glasses.

553
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:39,666
So, why did M. Benedict Farley
not realize the difference

554
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,791
between two totally dissimilar
letters, hein?

555
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,208
Because, mes amis,

556
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:47,874
I was in the company of a man
with normal eyesight

557
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,708
wearing powerful glasses.

558
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,041
And such powerful glasses

559
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,999
would render a man of normal
eyesight practically blind.

560
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,208
Is that not so, Doctor?

561
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,833
If they were
very powerful spectacles, yes.

562
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,041
Eh bien!

563
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,874
So, why was I not allowed to go

564
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:03,541
into M. Benedict Farley's room
that night?

565
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,541
What was in
M. Benedict Farley's room

566
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,333
that I was not allowed to see?

567
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:11,916
Mesdames et messieurs,
shall I enlighten you?

568
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,499
I wish you would, Poirot.

569
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,874
Very well.

570
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,249
Poirot shall enlighten you.

571
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,166
What was in M. Benedict Farley's
own room

572
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,833
that M. Benedict Farley
did not allow me to see was...

573
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,208
M. Benedict Farley.

574
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,749
Good God.

575
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,708
Yesterday afternoon,

576
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:47,458
there are three witnesses
to swear

577
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:52,166
that no one comes in or out
of M. Benedict Farley's room.

578
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:55,999
M. Cornworthy is in his room
next door,

579
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:01,499
and as 12:28 approaches,
he readies himself.

580
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:06,999
You see, M. Cornworthy
knows something

581
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:11,124
that very few other people know,
hmm?

582
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:14,833
He knows that
M. Benedict Farley, every day,

583
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,708
after all these years,

584
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,708
still interested

585
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,916
in the day-to-day running
of his factory,

586
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:23,041
checks up on his employees.

587
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,874
Let us see how he does this.

588
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:59,833
How can this king of pies
observe his workers

589
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:03,666
without ever leaving this house,
hein?

590
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:07,916
Simple.

591
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,791
You see, the uninviting delicacy

592
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,749
is first steamed for one hour
before it is baked,

593
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,041
and the release valves
on the vast ovens,

594
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,124
which are situated
beyond that wall,

595
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:27,583
are briefly tested
as soon as the ovens are loaded.

596
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,041
Mm.

597
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,041
Eh bien.

598
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,999
If one leans out of this window,

599
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:40,416
one can readily confirm
this fact.

600
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,041
Now, if you please,

601
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,333
I want you all to come to
these two windows, lean out,

602
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,416
and look to your right.

603
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:54,583
M. Cornworthy,
why don't you lead the way, hmm?

604
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,374
Oh, this is nonsense.

605
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,041
Perhaps.

606
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,124
But humor me?

607
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:04,583
Merci.

608
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,166
Alors, viens, viens, viens.

609
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,166
Mme. Farley?

610
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:10,749
Oh, very well.

611
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,041
Now, one can readily see

612
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,541
that spurt of steam issuing
from the chimney or pipe

613
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,124
at the eastern end
of the building. Voilà?

614
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:25,166
All the same, I don't see
where that gets us.

615
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,458
M. Farley comes to the window.

616
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,708
Yes?

617
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,249
He leans out to make sure that
the bake is starting on time.

618
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:36,458
All right.

619
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,416
And then...

620
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:54,083
M. Cornworthy shoots him,
and Farley falls to the floor.

621
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:57,166
Remember -- there is
a blank wall opposite,

622
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,374
so there can be no witnesses.

623
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:01,624
Lies, ridiculous lies.

624
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:06,666
All has the appearance
of being above the board, yes?

625
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,499
M. Tremlett and the other men

626
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:13,916
see M. Cornworthy go
into M. Farley's room,

627
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,249
but rush out again

628
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,416
with the announcement
of M. Farley's suicide.

629
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,583
What they do not, of course, see

630
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:24,166
is M. Cornworthy press the gun
into M. Farley's hand.

631
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,458
Slanderous rubbish.

632
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:31,874
It was M. Cornworthy
who wrote to me the letter,

633
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:35,249
M. Cornworthy who gave
instructions to the butler.

634
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:40,416
It was he who went up to his
bedroom, applied the makeup,

635
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:43,958
and played the part
of Benedict Farley.

636
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,999
But there were two people
who carried through this fraud.

637
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,666
M. Cornworthy was one,

638
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,833
and the other...

639
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:57,124
Mme. Farley.

640
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,249
How dare you?!

641
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:03,874
In due course, the happy ending
would have been achieved.

642
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:11,583
£250,000, and two hearts
that beat as one.

643
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,249
Hastings, stop him!

644
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,624
Ohh!

645
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:57,208
Stop him, Herbert!
Stop him!

646
00:44:58,417 --> 00:44:59,874
What?

647
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,708
Oh. Right.

648
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:28,583
I say!

649
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,499
Well done, sir!

650
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,541
That's Herbert.

651
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:43,249
I've come to elope.
It's still on, is it?

652
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:47,749
It's not, strictly speaking,
necessary anymore.

653
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:48,958
Oh.

654
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:53,041
Well, we could do it, anyway,
though, if you like.

655
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,874
Yes.

656
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:59,374
What shall I do with him?

657
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,666
I'll deal with him, sir.
Thank you very much.

658
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:18,208
Au revoir, Mme. Farley.

659
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,624
You foreigner.

660
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:52,208
Good afternoon, sir.

661
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:53,624
Good afternoon.

662
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:56,124
Can I assist you in any way,
sir?

663
00:46:56,334 --> 00:47:09,374
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

664
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:32,874
Can I give you a breather
with that?

665
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,833
No, no, no, no.
Thank you, Hastings.

666
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:38,291
I'm sure I can manage
the last five paces.

667
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,208
Mr. Poirot, let me help you.

668
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:44,624
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Miss Lemon.

669
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:51,999
This is for you.

670
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:54,541
Oh, Mr. Poirot,
you shouldn't have.

671
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,999
No, no, no, no, no, no,
nonsense, Miss Lemon.

672
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,041
Hastings, if you please --
the knife.

673
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,583
Merci.

674
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:19,083
Et maintenant... voilà!

675
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,249
Well, what do you think,
eh, Miss Lemon?

676
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:29,874
-It's --
-Wonderful, eh?

677
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,208
It's --

678
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:35,208
Now we shall have...

679
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,999
no more leaning dangerously
out of the window

680
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:40,249
to tell the time, yes?

681
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,291
It's just what I wanted.

682
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:54,333
Hastings... there are two reasons

683
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:57,999
why I should never become
the millionaire.

684
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,916
What are they, Poirot?

685
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,916
The first --

686
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:08,208
that I should never make
the detestable pork pies, hein?

687
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,541
And the second.

688
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:18,416
I am too understanding
towards my employees.

689
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,041
Quite.
