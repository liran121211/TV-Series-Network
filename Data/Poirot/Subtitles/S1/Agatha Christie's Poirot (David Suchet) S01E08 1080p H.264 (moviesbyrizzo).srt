1
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,374
Mayfield.

2
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,833
Sir George.

3
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,499
Show me.

4
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:12,958
Better be good.

5
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,541
Damn sight too good

6
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,041
for His Majesty's government,
if you ask me.

7
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,124
You expect too much of
the Defence Committee, Mayfield.

8
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,666
So, this is it at last, is it?

9
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,874
A Mayfield Kestrel.

10
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,874
Until we can think
of a better name.

11
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,083
Petroleum jelly, Hastings.

12
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,416
That is the secret.

13
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,416
You rub it well in, and it will
prevent the cracking, yes?

14
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,583
How would you work out
cubic what-you-call-'ems?

15
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:33,708
Come?

16
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,958
Cubic thingummies.
How do you work them out?

17
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,666
I mean, this ceiling's, what,
10 feet up, yes?

18
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,749
So, do you multiply 10 --

19
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:44,041
Hastings, I am trying
to instruct you

20
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,749
in the care of patent leather,

21
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,833
something that will be of use
to you in later life.

22
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,833
Well, so will cubic whatsits.

23
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,124
Suppose I had to
survey something or something.

24
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,041
You do not deceive me, Hastings.

25
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,083
You are having
these eccentric thoughts

26
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,208
because of this girl
of yours, huh?

27
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,374
This student of architecture.

28
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,166
Well, we never seem
to have anything to talk about.

29
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,958
I tried reading a book
about Bernini.

30
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,999
She's very keen on Bernini.

31
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,208
I couldn't make head or tail
of it.

32
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,124
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Hastings.

33
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,791
Women do not wish to talk about
Bernini and cubic thingummies.

34
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,708
I don't know that she wants
to talk about anything.

35
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,041
She's never in
when I call 'round to see her.

36
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,458
I end up having tea
with her mother every day.

37
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,333
How does it compare
with the Messerschmitt 109?

38
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,916
More maneuverable.

39
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,583
Got a turning circle
of 800 feet.

40
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,708
Visibility is better, too.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,374
Fuel injection?

42
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,458
No.

43
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,416
Pity.

44
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,249
P.M.'s very keen
on fuel injection.

45
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,083
Yes, he's right.

46
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,083
But we just haven't got
a reliable system yet.

47
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,333
There's a lady
keeps telephoning, Mr. Poirot.

48
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,124
Sacre!

49
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,458
What a terrible circumstance.

50
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,124
There's no need to be sarcastic,
Mr. Poirot.

51
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,541
I was going on to say that
I didn't put her through to you

52
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,999
because she wouldn't
give her name.

53
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:46,916
Oh.

54
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,791
I told her you don't
take anonymous phone calls.

55
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,541
But I do, Miss Lemon.

56
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,958
Sometimes I think
anonymous telephone calls

57
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,583
are the only ones worth taking.

58
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,708
But how will I know
where to file her

59
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,541
if I haven't got a name?

60
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,791
Life first, Miss Lemon.

61
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,958
Filing second.

62
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:05,958
Very well, then.

63
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,833
Next time she calls,
I'll let her talk to you.

64
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,416
And on your own head be it.

65
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,291
You shouldn't tease her, Poirot.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,583
She makes it irresistible.

67
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,124
It's like a solid wall
of lead 2 feet square

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,583
coming straight at you.

69
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,166
The main spire
must be tremendously strong

70
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,124
to withstand the g-force
of that turning circle.

71
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,749
And the recoil from the guns.

72
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,791
It's built up in layers,

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,749
so the whole thing acts
like a giant leaf spring.

74
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,041
And we're still
improving on it, too.

75
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,999
But I can't go on pouring my own
money into the Kestrel forever.

76
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,999
You seem not to understand
the position

77
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,249
that the Defence Committee
is in, Mayfield.

78
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,208
They like you.

79
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,958
Most of them
are 100% behind you.

80
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,958
But that Japanese business only
brought the government down.

81
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,249
One more scandal like that --

82
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,499
There are no more scandals
like that.

83
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,333
You're saying
they don't trust me.

84
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,333
-It's not a question of trust.
-Yes, it is!

85
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,458
Very well, then.

86
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,958
If they want me to prove to them
that they can trust me,

87
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,041
that's what I'll do.

88
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,499
How do you mean?
How will you do that?

89
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:57,958
I've invited Mrs. Vanderlyn down
for the weekend.

90
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,124
Mrs. Vanderlyn?
You mad?

91
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,999
You've invited her down here?

92
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,666
And before the weekend is out,
I promise you,

93
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,708
I'll have hooked Mrs. Vanderlyn,
reeled her in, and gaffed her.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,249
How?

95
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,458
By using the plans
of the Kestrel as a bait.

96
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,291
You idiot.

97
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,874
You can't go using
top secret papers like that.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,666
This is madness.

99
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,041
Hercule Poirot's residence.

100
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,916
Yes.

101
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,541
What name is it, please?

102
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,916
Hold on one moment, please.

103
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,958
It's your anonymous
telephone caller again.

104
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,916
She's calling herself Miss Smith
this time, but it's her.

105
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,499
Put her through, Miss Lemon.

106
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,333
Yes, Mr. Poirot.

107
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,458
Are you there?

108
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,999
Mr. Poirot
will speak to you now.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,958
Hello?

110
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,499
-M. Poirot?
-Yes, Miss Smith.

111
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,916
I need to meet you, M. Poirot.
This is a national emergency.

112
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,541
No, no, no.
I can't come there.

113
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,041
Somewhere where nobody
will know us.

114
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,208
I'm sure that can be arranged,
mademoiselle.

115
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,583
Where do you suggest?

116
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,916
M. Poirot.

117
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,541
You are not Miss Smith.

118
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,499
Yes, I am.

119
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,041
Where is your green carnation?

120
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,666
I wanted time to study you.

121
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,874
Besides, green doesn't suit me.

122
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,666
I was carrying my Times.

123
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,583
These arrangements, once made,

124
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,749
should be adhered to,
Miss Smith.

125
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,166
This is so difficult.

126
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,666
My husband --

127
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,124
Yes?

128
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,583
My husband has invited a woman

129
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,541
to stay this weekend
at our house.

130
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,458
No, Miss Smith.
Go no further.

131
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,999
Poirot does not handle
this type of work.

132
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,541
No, no. You don't understand.
This is a dangerous woman.

133
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,916
I know that a man

134
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,749
as distinguished in his field
as you are

135
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,541
wouldn't handle
sordid domestic cases.

136
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,458
There's more at stake here.

137
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,374
I see.

138
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,624
My name is not really
Miss Smith.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,249
I am astounded.

140
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,708
My name is Mayfield --
Lady Margaret Mayfield.

141
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,833
And who is Lord Mayfield?

142
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:30,249
There isn't one.
I'm only Mrs. Mayfield, really.

143
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,791
But my father was an earl.

144
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,291
And who is this dangerous woman
you talk about?

145
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,541
Mrs. Joanna Vanderlyn.

146
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:47,916
Mrs. Vanderlyn is rumored
to have pro-German sympathies.

147
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,249
There was a scandal
two years ago

148
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,333
with a young marquess
of Lowestoft.

149
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,874
He shot himself.

150
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:55,833
Yes, I remember.

151
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,958
Mrs. Vanderlyn was involved?

152
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,333
Yes. It was thought

153
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:03,041
that he passed on to her
certain secret information.

154
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,541
I did not know that.

155
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,291
It was kept hushed up
as much as possible.

156
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,874
His regiment had been involved
in testing the Galahad tank.

157
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,041
And you think --

158
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,499
My husband is engaged
in a lot of projects

159
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,374
that are crucial
to the future of this country.

160
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,374
If an enemy
should gain access --

161
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,083
Surely, you do not suspect
your husband of treachery?

162
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,458
No, of course not.

163
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:28,166
But the government
has treated him very badly

164
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:31,333
ever since
that Japanese business.

165
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,583
You must have read about it.

166
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,583
Even though
his name was cleared,

167
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,541
they still don't give him
the backing he needs.

168
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:44,541
Bitterness may make him
less careful than he should be.

169
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:46,958
Please help me, M. Poirot.

170
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,666
There is so much at stake
for England.

171
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,208
Good evening, Lady Carrington.

172
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,583
Hello, Dawson.
Where is everybody?

173
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,208
On the lower terrace,
Lady Carrington.

174
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,291
We can only put our
trust in the League of Nations,

175
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,416
pray for peace.

176
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,458
Isn't that
a rather peculiar thing

177
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,541
for an arms manufacturer
to do, sir?

178
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,708
What is it Beverley Nichols
calls you?

179
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,166
Merchants of death.

180
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,499
Mr. Mayfield is an armaments
manufacturer, Reggie,

181
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,333
because this particular game can
only be played from strength.

182
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,374
-Oh.
-Quite right, Sir George.

183
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,833
Oh, sorry, Dad.

184
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,458
Didn't realize
it was all a game.

185
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,124
Where has the fabled
Mrs. Vanderlyn got to, I wonder?

186
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,999
I haven't the foggiest.
She arrived hours ago.

187
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,249
You have met her before?

188
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,458
Not since I was a child.

189
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,166
Please.

190
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,749
Yes, she's the daughter
of H.K. Griffin.

191
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,083
Man used to be
American ambassador over here.

192
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,124
Apparently,
we all have to be very nice

193
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,541
to the Americans these days.

194
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,958
Ready for when the war starts.

195
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,624
Oh.

196
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,666
Mother's finally arrived.

197
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,374
All these exciting people.

198
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,249
I wasn't warned
it was going to be a rout.

199
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,499
Isabelle, I'm so glad
you could come.

200
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm just sorry
I'm so unforgivably late.

201
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,624
Will I be completely deterred
if I don't change?

202
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,041
You'll be the talk
of Steeple Bumpstead.

203
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,291
Oh, God, I wouldn't want that.

204
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,041
-Good journey, darling?
-Lovely, George.

205
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,999
The A11 is
particularly enthralling

206
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,124
at this time of year.
Hello, Tommy.

207
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,541
May I introduce
M. Hercule Poirot?

208
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,083
-How nice to meet you.
-Mademoiselle.

209
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,624
-Foreign, yes?
-Uh --

210
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,833
You'll soon pick up
our little ways.

211
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,749
Talking of which...

212
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,583
Oh, how English.

213
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,999
How very, very English.

214
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,999
We've got some very American
dry martinis mixed,

215
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,249
if you'd like one.

216
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,166
Oh, that would be wonderful.

217
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,208
Trouble with
the Foreign Office is,

218
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,874
it's very long on protocol

219
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,041
on whether the prime minister
of Timbuktu

220
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,583
should take precedence
over the king of Ongo-Bongo.

221
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,083
I'm very short
on what Winnie describes

222
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,249
as intestinal fortitude.

223
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,666
I'm sure that's not true
of your foreign secretary.

224
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,999
I must bow to your superior
knowledge, Mrs. Vanderlyn.

225
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,249
I'm sure you know Mr. Eden
a great deal better

226
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,333
than us humble souls, eh?

227
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,124
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

228
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,999
But when I had lunch
with him yesterday,

229
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,666
he was saying more or less
the same as you

230
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,666
about the Foreign Office's
passion for protocol.

231
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,999
No, thank you.

232
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:26,499
I refuse to let men
waste their time drinking port

233
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,374
when there's bridge
to be played.

234
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:31,416
-Sir George.
-Yes.

235
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,916
You see what sort of a woman
she is.

236
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,041
The sort of woman
Mrs. Vanderlyn is

237
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,916
does not make a matter
of national importance.

238
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,499
I do hope you're right.

239
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,583
M. Poirot.

240
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,124
Actually,
the whole European situation's

241
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,499
rather like a bridge game
at the moment.

242
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,999
On the one hand,
we have the diminutive Führer,

243
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,249
on the other hand,
Signor Mussolini,

244
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,499
the bullfrog
of the Pontine Marshes.

245
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,541
In the end, they'll both
need taking down a peg or two.

246
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,083
And what about
the Emperor Hirohito, sir?

247
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:18,083
Will he need taking down a peg?

248
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,041
What did he say?

249
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,541
Has he said
something nasty again?

250
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,083
He's such a little snot,
aren't you, darling?

251
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,958
Tommy's working too hard.

252
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,499
He believes
we're on the brink of war.

253
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,624
That he can stop it
single-handed?

254
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,833
Something like that.

255
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,749
The truth is, of course,
he can do more than most people.

256
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,541
A little slam, I think.

257
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,916
Congratulations, partner.

258
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,583
Aren't you going to give us
our revenge?

259
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,791
George and I have work to do,
I'm afraid.

260
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,249
The plans are ready
for you, sir.

261
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,583
We'll join you in a minute.
Come along, George.

262
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:55,833
If you'll excuse us.

263
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,583
I will take a promenade
in the garden before turning in.

264
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:09,458
It will clear my brain.

265
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,041
You might've done that
before we played cards.

266
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,999
Madam is too agreeable.

267
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,333
Good night.

268
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,583
There you are, my friend.

269
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,999
Why can't I stay at the house?
That's what I want to know.

270
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,624
Number one, Hastings,
you were not invited.

271
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,999
A pure oversight.

272
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,124
Number two, I need you at this
stage incognito and very nearby.

273
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,708
My incognito's gone,
for a start.

274
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,833
Why?
Why is this?

275
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,541
Well, the pub's so crowded,
I'm having to share a room.

276
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,458
And you'll never guess who with.

277
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,166
No, Hastings, I will not.

278
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,708
Japp.

279
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,291
With the Chief Inspector Japp?

280
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,708
And the room
has only got one bed.

281
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,666
I wonder why the
Chief Inspector Japp is here.

282
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,666
You're not very sympathetic.

283
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,916
We all have our troubles,
Hastings.

284
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,916
I would rather share a bed

285
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:45,208
with the Chief Inspector Japp
and three of his sergeants

286
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:48,166
than to be partnered at bridge
with the Lady Carrington.

287
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,708
Yes, I've been hearing about her
from the chauffeur.

288
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,249
Apparently, Sir George
is trying to get her

289
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,624
to give up cards altogether.

290
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,708
Yes, well, I'm very pleased
to hear it, mon ami.

291
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,333
She plays abominably.

292
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,958
No, but she loses a lot of money
at it.

293
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,083
She's heavily in hock
to money lenders.

294
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,666
Really?

295
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,458
Hastings, try to find out
for me, if you please,

296
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,541
who asked the chief inspector
to be here.

297
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,291
That is most interesting.

298
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,833
-Good night, Mumsy.
-Goodnight, darling.

299
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,208
What do you think of this idea

300
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,583
of detecting aircraft
by radio echoes?

301
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,666
RDF?
Feasible.

302
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,541
We've put a certain amount
of money into research.

303
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,916
How much money?

304
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:09,208
I'm not gonna tell you that.

305
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,499
Oh, hello.

306
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,416
I just came in to fetch my bag.

307
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,124
Don't mind us.

308
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,458
Good night again.

309
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,291
Good night.

310
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,374
Having that woman here
is a mistake, Mayfield.

311
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,708
No matter what your intentions
are, it'll do you no good.

312
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,583
It will do me
a great deal of good

313
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,624
when I get her put
into Holloway Prison.

314
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,041
Ah, it's all nonsense,
all this talk of trapping her.

315
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,958
What was that?

316
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,083
What?

317
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,416
Someone ran across
the terrace there.

318
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,083
I didn't see anything.

319
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,374
Anyway, how do you intend
to trap her?

320
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,791
I'm sure I saw something.

321
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,958
Why do politicians
treat everyone else like idiots?

322
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,041
Hmph.

323
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,583
Probably because they voted
for us in the first place.

324
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,374
I've laid everything out
on the desk, sir.

325
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,916
Will you want me
anymore tonight?

326
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,833
Uh, no.
We'll probably be late.

327
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,416
You might as well turn in.

328
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:12,291
-I'll lock these away myself.
-Right.

329
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,041
Goodnight, Mr. Mayfield.
Sir George.

330
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,374
Just a minute.

331
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,041
You've forgotten
the most important paper.

332
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,874
I don't think so, sir.

333
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:23,833
Sheet number three,

334
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,041
the mathematics
for the aluminium stressing.

335
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,124
I put it on the top.

336
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,999
It isn't here.

337
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,999
I don't understand.

338
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,583
I put it here.
I know I did.

339
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,666
No, you must have
made a mistake.

340
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,166
It must still be in the safe.

341
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,458
No. I put it there.

342
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,541
I looked for it particularly
and put it on the top.

343
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,374
Do you mean to tell me
it's gone?

344
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,249
Who's been in this room?

345
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,791
No one at all.

346
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,166
Well, it can't just have
vanished into thin air.

347
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:06,958
Someone must have taken it.

348
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,874
Can Poirot be of assistance?

349
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,666
Finding the lost property

350
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,958
is something
of a profession of mine.

351
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,874
What is missing?

352
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,208
This is a matter
of national security.

353
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,458
I think we should
alert Inspector Japp.

354
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,749
Telephone him at The Three
Crowns, would you, Mr. Carlile?

355
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,791
Where does that door lead?

356
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,749
Well done.

357
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,874
This wasn't meant to happen.

358
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,708
But it was.
You said --

359
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,083
Not like this.

360
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,541
She's turned the tables on us.

361
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,916
Oh, my God.
I knew it.

362
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,166
I knew it.

363
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:02,374
I told you not to play
with fire.

364
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,958
What am I going to tell
the P.M.?

365
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,333
Nothing for the moment.

366
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,624
You mustn't panic.

367
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,624
I'm damned if that
woman's gonna get away with it.

368
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,583
M. Mayfield, forgive me.

369
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,999
I do not wish to delve
into the secrets.

370
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,999
But, please, can you give me
some idea what is on the paper?

371
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,666
I don't know how closely

372
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,791
you follow international events,
Mr. Poirot,

373
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,791
but Germany has just announced

374
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,666
that she has parity
with this country in the air.

375
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,999
And so I understand.

376
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,208
Yeah, well, what that means
is that that piece of paper

377
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:47,874
is perhaps our only chance of
keeping our civilian population

378
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,874
safe from aerial attack.

379
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,291
Am I exaggerating?

380
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:52,666
Not a jot.

381
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:55,749
So, the technical
breakthrough, huh?

382
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,416
And worth a considerable amount
of money.

383
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,624
Oh, money doesn't enter into it.

384
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,583
Well, it might with some people
and in certain quarters.

385
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:06,958
Traitors, you mean.

386
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,541
Indeed.

387
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,874
But anyone, me included,

388
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,249
could knock on the door
of the German Embassy,

389
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,333
and when I come out,
I could be a rich man

390
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,749
if I had these papers?

391
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,458
Certainly.

392
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:21,833
Hmm.

393
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:25,791
M. Carlile, before I went
for my promenade in the garden,

394
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,124
you volunteered to get
the papers ready in here?

395
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:31,458
Yes.

396
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:32,791
And shortly after that,

397
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,458
everyone else went upstairs
to prepare for the bed?

398
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,124
I presume so.
I don't know.

399
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,624
Yes, they did.

400
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,541
Mrs. Vanderlyn came down again.

401
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,624
Indeed?

402
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,999
That's right.
She'd forgotten her bag.

403
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,124
Ah.
The old gasp, huh?

404
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,374
Uh, no. Pardon.

405
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,708
The old wheeze --

406
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,708
to return for something
you say you had forgotten.

407
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,083
Quite.

408
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,083
M. Carlile,

409
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,833
after you had opened the safe
and got out the papers,

410
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:09,541
did you leave the study again,
even for a moment?

411
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,999
No, not for a second.

412
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:16,124
So, everyone else was upstairs
preparing for the bed,

413
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,999
except Mrs. Vanderlyn,
who came down for her bag.

414
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:24,041
And yet the plans are stolen.

415
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,666
M. Carlile,

416
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,374
do you still want to say
you did not leave the study?

417
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,416
I don't know
what all this is about, Poirot.

418
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,749
Carlile has been
my confidential secretary

419
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,083
for nine years.

420
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,416
He has access
to all my private papers.

421
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:45,791
He could have made a copy
of that sheet anytime he liked

422
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,791
with no one being any the wiser.

423
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,999
Why would he need to stage
a rather clumsy robbery?

424
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,833
Thank you, Mr. Mayfield.

425
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,916
If M. Poirot has any suspicions,

426
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,416
I should like
all my belongings searched.

427
00:26:58,542 --> 00:26:59,791
No, no, no, no, no.

428
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,166
M. Carlile,
I cast not the aspersions.

429
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,916
It is a small problem, merely,

430
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,499
but a problem that will agitate
the little gray cells

431
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,958
most adequately.

432
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:20,958
With Carlile on guard
all the time,

433
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,291
I don't see how anyone
could get into that room.

434
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,499
Yes, well, it is no use

435
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,624
running to conclusions,
M. Mayfield.

436
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,666
It is from there that you saw
Mrs. Vanderlyn in here.

437
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:33,166
A little further back, I think.

438
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,833
From where I was in the garden,

439
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,624
I could see that the dining room
was in darkness.

440
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,791
But it would have been
quite possible

441
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:48,166
for someone to use those doors
to get out onto the terrace

442
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,208
and, from there, into the study.

443
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,333
I told you
I thought I saw something!

444
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,999
-By George, you did.
-There!

445
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,124
Across the lawn
to a waiting car.

446
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,958
He'll be miles away by now.

447
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,291
No, no, no, no, no.

448
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,749
The one way through the garden

449
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,083
would have taken him
directly past me.

450
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,791
Uh, what's going on?

451
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,791
Get back to bed, Reggie.

452
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,458
Hmm.

453
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:17,541
So, an interesting situation.

454
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:20,624
The only person
who could possibly have stolen

455
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,083
those most important papers
is one of us.

456
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,083
Or Mrs. Vanderlyn.

457
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,291
Evening, Mr. Mayfield.
Sir George. Poirot.

458
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,833
What's all this, then,
about a theft?

459
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,749
A very important secret paper

460
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,499
has been stolen from my study,
Chief Inspector.

461
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,749
Right, lads, fan out.

462
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,666
Whittaker, take the north end
of the house,

463
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,666
Dobson, the upstairs landing,
Biels, the servants' quarters.

464
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,208
It is not, perhaps,
as simple as that, mon ami.

465
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,124
Whoever stole this paper

466
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,083
will not leave it lying around
where we will find it.

467
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,083
Leave this to the professionals,
Poirot.

468
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,083
Missing documents are an
everyday occurrence to my lads.

469
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,166
I'll bet.

470
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,874
And who might you be?

471
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:11,874
His son.

472
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,041
I thought I told you
to go to bed!

473
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,583
Sorry, Chief Inspector.

474
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:17,499
It's all perfectly simple,
really.

475
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,874
You see, we know
who stole those papers.

476
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:21,958
Indeed?

477
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,249
Uh, George, I do wish --

478
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,708
A guest in this house --
a Mrs. Vanderlyn.

479
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,458
-Really?
-Well...

480
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,666
So, I suggest we get
straight up there and --

481
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:31,958
Pardon me for asking, sir,

482
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,749
but how, precisely,
do we know this Mrs., uh...

483
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:36,874
Vanderlyn.

484
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:40,374
Can't go into details now.
Matter of national security.

485
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,458
-All you've got to do --
-George.

486
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,416
I don't know
that this is the right idea.

487
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,749
Sorry, Mayfield.

488
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,208
I know it's your house
and all that sort of thing,

489
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:48,624
but it's my pigeon now.

490
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,208
Come on, Japp.

491
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,583
Mrs. Vanderlyn?

492
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:10,916
What is it?

493
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,374
This is Sir George Carrington.
I have the police with me.

494
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,499
What do you want?

495
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:28,416
I'd like you to get dressed,
Mrs. Vanderlyn,

496
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,791
and accompany me
to the local police station.

497
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,583
What are you talking about?

498
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,874
If you'd just
get dressed, ma'am.

499
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,541
Damned if I will.
What for?

500
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,124
Some papers have been stolen

501
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:40,916
from Mr. Mayfield's study,
Mrs. Vanderlyn.

502
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,166
And?

503
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:45,333
If you could just get dressed,
Mrs. Vanderlyn.

504
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,416
Did you plan this, Mr. Mayfield?

505
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,374
I'll get dressed.

506
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,624
You'll join us
at the station, Mr. Mayfield?

507
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,333
It must be here.
It must be.

508
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:57,499
Where's she hidden it, Poirot?

509
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,791
You're used to
this sort of thing.

510
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:05,833
She's got it with her.
That's what it is.

511
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,958
They'll find it
when they search her.

512
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,124
Let's imagine you're a woman,
Poirot.

513
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,666
By all means, Sir George,
if it will help you.

514
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,291
Right.
You're a woman.

515
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,958
You're in a strange household.
You steal some papers.

516
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,499
Where do you hide them?

517
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,666
Sir George, there is one thing
in all this

518
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:46,874
that I do not understand.

519
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,208
Keep going.

520
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,749
I demonstrated,
quite cogently, I think,

521
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,833
that of all the people
in the house,

522
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,791
only you, M. Mayfield,
M. Carlile, and myself

523
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,374
could possibly have stolen
those papers, yes?

524
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,333
Aye.

525
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,791
And yet you go on talking
as if Mrs. Vanderlyn

526
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:05,666
was, without doubt,
the miscreant.

527
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,041
Hmm. Huh?

528
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,791
Oh, yes.

529
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,708
Well, that sort of thing
is all very well, I'm sure.

530
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,583
But it's only theory, isn't it?

531
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,333
We're practical folk here,
Poirot.

532
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,708
Yes.

533
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,083
Nothing, sir.

534
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,874
It's not in her room.

535
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,999
She hasn't got it on her,
either.

536
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,249
This is a disaster, Mayfield.

537
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,583
She must have hidden it
somewhere to collect it later.

538
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,124
Froggy thinks she didn't do it.

539
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:37,749
Froggy knows she didn't do it.

540
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:12,208
Anywhere you see the dust's
been disturbed, let me know.

541
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:14,958
It's just one sheet of paper
we're looking for, remember.

542
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:16,874
It could be anywhere.

543
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,291
That's got rid of that.

544
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,041
Poirot, my dear fellow,

545
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,124
I promise you, you've never
heard anything like it.

546
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,749
You know those boots he wears?

547
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,124
Bang.

548
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,749
The other one -- crash.

549
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,791
When he finally gets into bed,
it's worse.

550
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,708
-Worse?
-He talks in his sleep.

551
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,708
"Now I've got you,
young fellow, me lad.

552
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,416
Japp of the Yard strikes again."

553
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,791
I thought I'd go mad.

554
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,999
Every time I managed to
drop off, he'd start shouting.

555
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,583
"Stand back, lads.
He's got a blancmange."

556
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,833
Some of the things he was saying
were enough to make a cat laugh.

557
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,708
I can't take much more of it,
Poirot.

558
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,583
I've been through three days
of a jerry barrage.

559
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,083
Where is he now?

560
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,166
Gone back up to the house.

561
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,499
By the way, I found out
who asked him down.

562
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,291
It was Sir George.

563
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,541
Not M. Mayfield.

564
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,291
Apparently not.

565
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,374
Bon.
Just as I thought.

566
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,583
What happened
about Mrs. Vanderlyn?

567
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,916
Oh, she's leaving this morning
in a great, um, huff, yes?

568
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,874
In fact, the whole house
is quite deserted.

569
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,791
Lady Carrington and Reggie
left after breakfast.

570
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:00,124
Hastings,
I want to ask you something.

571
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,166
Ask away.

572
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,499
Last night at dinner,
one of the guests

573
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,458
said something to M. Mayfield
about Japan.

574
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,374
What is it about Japan,
Hastings?

575
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,666
Well, this is a few years back,

576
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,458
when the Japs took it into
their head to invade Manchuria.

577
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:19,041
The press got hold of something
about Mayfield's company

578
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,583
supplying them
with the howitzers

579
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,791
they were
bombarding Shanghai with.

580
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,833
It turns out, eventually,
that the press had got hold

581
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:27,166
of the wrong end of the stick,
as per usual.

582
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,541
But by that time, there had been
questions in Parliament,

583
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:30,916
God knows what.

584
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,666
And a lot of the mud stuck.

585
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,083
Hastings, I must go back
to the house.

586
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,249
Well, give me half a sec,
and I'll drive you.

587
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,166
I want to change the plugs
this morning, anyway.

588
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,624
I thought I'd do it up there.

589
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,999
No, no, no.

590
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,541
I need to walk.

591
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,999
And to think.

592
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,708
Mrs. Vanderlyn.

593
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,458
-You left this bag.
-Thank you.

594
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,499
Dickson.

595
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,499
Post this for her, will you?

596
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,708
She'll only forget.

597
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,416
Yeah, she's definitely
running rich.

598
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,708
Here, let's have a look
at the carb.

599
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,541
Hastings!
Hastings!

600
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,333
Hastings, no more
of the tinkering.

601
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:47,958
We have to follow
Mrs. Vanderlyn.

602
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:48,999
But I've got the plugs out.

603
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,249
It'll take me an hour
to get them back.

604
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,874
Oh, no!
Mon Dieu!

605
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,666
Here, Hastings.
Allons-y!

606
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,749
Hey!

607
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,333
I'm assuming they're heading
for the London road.

608
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:12,958
There. Look!

609
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,416
We must not let them see us,
Hastings.

610
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,499
-Can we get a move on, John?
-Yes, ma'am.

611
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,541
-Damn!
-What is it?

612
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,374
They should have turned left
on the A11.

613
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,541
Why is that, Hastings?

614
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,624
Because that's the road
to London.

615
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,208
Where are they going, then?

616
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,708
Get the map
out of the pocket there.

617
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,333
Hold tight.

618
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,374
They're on that road there.

619
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:45,583
Wicken Bonhunt.

620
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,166
Clavering.

621
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:48,541
Brent Pelham.

622
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,458
No.

623
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:51,291
-Mean anything to you?
-No.

624
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:54,499
Perhaps where they're going
isn't on the main road.

625
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:57,083
Look at the villages
on either side of the road.

626
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,666
Hare Street.

627
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,124
Buntingford.

628
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,041
Rickling.

629
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,458
Stocking Pelham.

630
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,083
Throcking.

631
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,874
No.

632
00:43:14,334 --> 00:43:17,208
Fellow I knew at the front
had a place in Throcking.

633
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:20,499
Right next door to the German
ambassador's country house.

634
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:23,666
Hastings.

635
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,541
Oh, my God!

636
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:27,791
Can we get there before them?

637
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,458
We can have a damn good try.

638
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:37,958
Where is it?

639
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,249
I don't know.

640
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,166
It was on the salver
in the hall!

641
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,124
Dawson put it there!

642
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,249
It seems just
to have disappeared.

643
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:46,791
Oh, God!

644
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,666
Can nothing go right?!

645
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:45,416
Good God, Poirot.

646
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,874
Yes, Hastings.

647
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,499
We have seen enough.

648
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,666
Come, my friend.

649
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,833
I wouldn't have thought she'd
have hidden them there, sir.

650
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:06,874
Have you got any better
suggestions, Constable?

651
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,333
No, sir.

652
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,708
Poirot!

653
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:17,083
You have to trust me, Margaret.

654
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,208
I do trust you, Tommy.

655
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,541
Everything you've worked for
is at stake, though.

656
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:25,916
It'll be all right.

657
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,791
Who is it?

658
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,124
Bonjour.

659
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,041
What do you want, Mr. Poirot?

660
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,666
I have come back to tell you

661
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:41,041
that the plans
have been safely delivered.

662
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,166
Delivered?

663
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:43,624
To the German ambassador.

664
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,416
I am sure Herr Von Eckersdorf
was very pleased.

665
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,874
Tommy, what are we going to do?

666
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,208
Also, Lady Margaret, I found
this from one of your guests.

667
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,541
It needed to be posted.

668
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,124
-Give me that!
-I don't want to read it.

669
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,249
The address is probably
a little cigarette shop

670
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,249
or a news agent,
M. Mayfield, huh?

671
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:07,083
From which you can collect it
at your leisure?

672
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:08,833
No need to go into that,
Mr. Poirot.

673
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:09,958
Let sleeping dogs lie.

674
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,208
No, no, no, no, M. Mayfield.

675
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:12,416
Between the husband
and the wife,

676
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,624
there should be not
the sleepy dogs.

677
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:18,333
I have no wish to read a letter
belonging to one of my guests.

678
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:19,708
Really?

679
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,458
Suppose I tell you that this
was written by Mrs. Vanderlyn

680
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,041
and that I could guarantee

681
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:30,041
that you would not understand
one word of it.

682
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:48,541
They're in Chinese.

683
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:50,541
Japanese.

684
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,749
But Tom's signature's
at the bottom.

685
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,124
This is the one piece of
evidence that links your husband

686
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,333
to the sales of arms
to the Japanese.

687
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:04,749
Somehow, they had fallen
into the hands of the Germans.

688
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,916
It was these two pieces of paper

689
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:09,499
that Mrs. Vanderlyn used
to blackmail him.

690
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,083
She said, however,
she would exchange them

691
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,833
for the plans of the Kestrel.

692
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,666
Oh, Tom.

693
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,874
If he were seen
to hand over those plans

694
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,333
to Mrs. Vanderlyn,
he would be ruined anyway.

695
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,124
So it had to look
as if somebody had stolen them.

696
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,958
And although
he tried to persuade us

697
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:30,666
that he saw this mysterious
figure on the terrace,

698
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,916
it was M. Mayfield himself
who stole those plans.

699
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,124
It was the safest way.

700
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,374
And they were securely
in his pocket

701
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,624
throughout the whole farce
of Mrs. Vanderlyn's arrest.

702
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,583
And you keep saying everything's
going to be all right.

703
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,124
-It will, darling. You --
-Let me pass!

704
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,458
-Let me pass!
-Please, Sir George.

705
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:50,708
I've had enough of this,
Mayfield!

706
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:51,916
What's going on?

707
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:53,708
I've been kept totally
in the dark!

708
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,499
No, no, no, no, no, Sir George.

709
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,166
The Germans have got
the missing papers.

710
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,708
What?

711
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:05,041
And you, M. Carlile, I imagine
you know this as well as anyone.

712
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:12,041
The German high command now has
plans of our new fighter,

713
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:14,708
on which they'll have to waste

714
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,541
six months
of concentrated effort

715
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,999
before they realize
they've been sold a pup.

716
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,666
What? Pup?
What's a pup?

717
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:26,083
A little dog, Sir George.

718
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,124
Little dog?

719
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:30,916
Oh, pup.

720
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:33,124
Sold a pup?

721
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,666
The plans were doctored.

722
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,541
The maths doesn't make
any sense.

723
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:39,208
But it'll take them a lot
of work to find that out.

724
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,999
Good God.

725
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,708
You cunning old devil.

726
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:53,874
Tommy.

727
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,333
Tommy, darling.

728
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:12,624
It goes against the grain

729
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,749
letting that Vanderlyn woman
go scot-free.

730
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,999
Ah, she will pay eventually,
mon ami.

731
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:21,208
For the moment, let her enjoy
what she thinks is her triumph.

732
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,333
If you ask me,
it just shows the dangers

733
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,416
of meeting anonymous women
at the zoo.

734
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:26,583
In you go, chap.

735
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:29,249
Well, Lady Margaret
got what she wanted, anyway.

736
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,458
Her and Mayfield
are all lovey-dovey again.

737
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,749
It must be depressing for you

738
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,124
when that sort of thing happens,
eh, Poirot?

739
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,499
What sort of thing?

740
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,916
Oh, everything working out
for the best.

741
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,916
Some married couple
ready for a second honeymoon.

742
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,958
Orphaned children
reunited with their parents.

743
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,624
Yes, it is hard. Mm.

744
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:53,499
But we must put on it
a brave face, huh?

745
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:57,874
And not allow cheerfulness
to keep breaking through.

746
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,749
Drive on, Hastings.
