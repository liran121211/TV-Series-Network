POIROT

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,190
The ADVENTURE OF JOHNNIE WAVERLY

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,540
- 50.000 Pounds?
- Yes.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,420
- The last letter was saying 30.000.
- And the previous one was asking 25.000.

5
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,980
You did not tell me that there was more.

6
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,030
I did not take them to serious.

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,270
Rays, Add, we are in England!
Here children are not kidnapped!

8
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,750
Go, car, one more effort.

9
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,150
When it took care, mother, it looks at the car.

10
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,590
- Beauty queen Lemon?
- Yes, Mr. Poirot?

11
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,870
They are almost 11:00H.

12
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,510
- I need the tisane punctually.
- Clear, Mr. Poirot.

13
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,110
It is already almost ended,
my system.

14
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,310
All his successful cases
and with crossed references,

15
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,390
in five different forms.

16
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,230
- Five?
- Yes.

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,190
Here, witnesses' names.
Here, criminals' names.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,150
Activity or profession
of the victim, type of case.

19
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,670
Kidnapping, dependence,

20
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,580
adultery,
to consult also " marriage ".

21
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,510
Bigamy, to consult " marriage ",
bombs...

22
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,630
To consult in " marriage ".

23
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,340
You. Waverly is here
to speak with you.

24
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,550
- Monsieur Waverly, good morning.
- How it has been passing?

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,030
Thank you, Beauty queen Lemon.
It can keep on filing things.

26
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,310
Beauty queen Lemon dreams with
the perfect system of filing,

27
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,950
what it will leave backwards
all the other systems.

28
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,910
This morning,
it is ready doing an innovation.

29
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,020
Call, which brings it consulting
Hercule Poirot?

30
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,910
- I was accepted.
- Acceptance?

31
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,990
In It Reads Mans. one remembers
that I applied the Lagonda?

32
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,940
I received the form of inscription,
I do not realize them to myself anything.

33
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,100
- What entusiasmante!
- The Branston also has a Lagonda.

34
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,710
- Did you already participate in races?
- Not, in fact, not.

35
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,590
- Who is with the Poirot?
- Such a Mr. Waverly. It is a case.

36
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,220
This morning I received this.

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,270
" He did not pay. His son him will be
taken away ás 12:00H of tomorrow,

38
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,190
" day 29. His redemption
it will cost to him 50 thousand pounds. "

39
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,350
- 50 thousand?
- What impertinence!

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,150
You dispose of 50 thousand pounds,
Monsieur, Waverly?

41
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,190
Well, I dare saying
that I can bring together them.

42
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,230
I understand.

43
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,540
- Does it think even that they will kidnap it?
- Clear! I have not because to doubt.

44
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,030
Holy God!

45
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,590
I introduce to him the Captain Hastings,
my partner. You. Waverly, a client.

46
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,910
Pleasure.

47
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,590
You. Waverly received letters
in what they threaten to kidnap the son.

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,430
To serious? In England?

49
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,790
He can be a group of foreigners.

50
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,190
These letters do not charge
that the author is foreign.

51
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,990
- It suspects someone, Mr. Waverly?
- Saint Deus, no.

52
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,670
- Is not it a target of resentments?
- I find that not. No.

53
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,700
Very well. Poirot will intervene.

54
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
It already showed this letter
to the Scotland Yard?

55
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,630
No, I came straightly for here.
It does not advance anything.

56
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,870
- They never appeared interested.
- I understand what it feels.

57
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,750
But now we will will speak again
with the Inspector-chief Japp.

58
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,590
I do not want to be much time
far from house.

59
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,390
I delay five minutes, at most,
packing

60
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,430
and we will catch the near train
after speaking with the Inspector.

61
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,300
- I can take you.
- No, I do not want to bother it.

62
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,590
He needs of going round.

63
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,550
It does not the question be a dog.
We are there this afternoon.

64
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,430
Beauty queen Lemon, we are going to be out
up to tomorrow. Guard the castle.

65
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,200
The Inspector-chief Japp
it is going to receive them, gentlemen.

66
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,870
- It prays well...
- Good morning, Inspector-chief.

67
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,550
But what unexpected pleasure,
Mr. Poirot. Mr. Waverly.

68
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,190
You. Waverly received another letter.

69
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,560
He thinks that the Police officer is not
convinced about the gravity of the case.

70
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,270
Therefore did it resort to you, Poirot?

71
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,910
You. Waverly is a man
of discernment and intelligence.

72
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,070
- Perhaps the case is serious.
- Billet what yes?

73
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,110
I think that preventing is better
of what to put right, Inspector-chief.

74
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,310
It is right, Mr. Poirot,
if we had many people operational.

75
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,430
We have hundreds of these cases all
the days. If we were investigating all...

76
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,910
Hundreds, Inspector-chief?

77
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,230
Well, he would not say hundreds,
it is not possible to take everything literally.

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,270
- Every day?
- At least, every week.

79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,550
It the question is a discontented employee,
an envious neighbor.

80
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,150
- We are wasting time, Mr. Poirot.
- It is not necessary to be hurt.

81
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,870
I am a rural nobleman. I pay mine
imposed and I wait for something in exchange.

82
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,310
- Now I know that it is not of use.
- There are many taxpayers.

83
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,470
There are also many rural noblemen.
If we...

84
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,790
Not only it does not cooperate,
since it also is very offensive.

85
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,390
Since you highlighted, you pay to me
to exercise my discernment

86
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,270
as for what it can threaten
the public order and this does not threaten.

87
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,070
- His superior will know of this.
- What I amuse so much all that.

88
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,910
- That police officer is a fool.
- No, the Japp is a good police officer.

89
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,310
The police officers cannot prevent.

90
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,630
An agent would be necessary for
always to accompany each citizen.

91
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,580
Fortunately for the human race,

92
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,910
most of us have a police officer here.

93
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,270
This kidnapper has not any police officer.

94
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,820
Thank you.

95
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,310
C'est magnifies.

96
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,150
This is the new house. It was built
for an ancestor of mine in 1 760,

97
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,550
when the old mansion
it was destroyed by a fire.

98
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,950
Is it increasing the work of his relative?

99
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,830
No, we began a restoration
there are five years.

100
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,940
We would stop,
I wait for them to myself to retake it soon.

101
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,870
From there are 400 years
what my family here survives.

102
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,510
- And is this land completely his?
- No, already it is not.

103
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,990
It was already, how far the sight was reaching.

104
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,550
But it is already not.

105
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,790
- Marcus, you returned!
- Hello. This is you. Hercules Poirot.

106
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,390
Enchantee, Lady. Hercule.

107
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,470
' - Say?
- And Hercule and not Hercules.

108
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,230
- Yes. He is the famous detective.
- I know.

109
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,350
Just as well what came, Mr. Poirot.
We did not know to whom resorting.

110
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,830
The Police officer does not do anything.

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,670
We will pay the peace of spirit
with our money.

112
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,870
But the Captain said to me
what his honorary are reasonable.

113
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,350
- Oh yes?
- I did not specify anything.

114
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,590
It arrived quite fast.

115
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,990
I delayed 75 minutes.
I reached 120 km for hour.

116
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,870
The Captain Hastings
it is delirious with cars.

117
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,230
It had the kindness to talk to me
of the race in which it is going to participate.

118
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,420
This subject is serious, Hastings.
We cannot amuse oneself.

119
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,110
The question of the kidnapping?
I spoke with you. Waverly on that.

120
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,310
We should not have worried.
The letters are a work of a crazy one.

121
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,860
I am more calm, Hastings.
Thank you.

122
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,910
But let's not put the car
at the front of the oxen. I am going to see the house.

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,150
Do favor.
This is the living room.

124
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,390
It gives for the terrace
through these carried ones.

125
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,830
- Is this the south side of the house?
- Exactamente.

126
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,030
- And does this division give for where?
- For the library.

127
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,070
Bon.

128
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,230
Thank you, Mr. Poirot. Thank you.

129
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,180
Everything will run well, Lady.

130
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,310
- The kidnapping is an easy crime.
- Easy?

131
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,110
Clear!

132
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,150
The child could have been kidnapped
in any height since it was born.

133
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,500
- There are four years.
- And of what that advances us?

134
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,350
On the contrary,
it advances us very much. It does not even imagine.

135
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,150
Because it will be
that the kidnappers make difficult the kidnapping

136
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,000
warning the family?

137
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,190
Some cases are simple,
someone are trés complicate.

138
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,100
But they all are interesting,

139
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,750
so they all depend on the character
of the intervenient ones.

140
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,550
Clear.

141
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,310
Excuse, it costs to me to speak normally
I eat if tomorrow...

142
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,340
He is ready went to sleep,
Mrs. Waverly. dismisses you, Johnnie.

143
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,750
- This is the famous Johnnie Waverly.
- Good night, I adopt.

144
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,110
- My car.
- What rich machine.

145
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,110
Is he seeing, Hastings?
Another enthusiast.

146
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,510
- It comes to ensconce myself in the bed.
- I do not delay anything, love.

147
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,790
- Thank you, Mrs. Withers.
- Good night.

148
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,070
Good night.

149
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,870
Darling!

150
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,350
Promptly, wanted. It is going to run everything well.

151
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,430
Clear what everything is going to run well.

152
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,510
Tomorrow, to I halve it,
the Johnnie will be gone by friends,

153
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,990
for his mother, his father, Hastings...

154
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,230
... for Poirot!

155
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,990
Nobody will kidnap the Johnnie Waverly.

156
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,470
She is my wife, it is ill.

157
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,150
It woke up with intestinal cramps.
The doctor is already with her.

158
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,860
- Cramps?
- It is necessary to have been something that she ate.

159
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,510
- I lament.
- Excuse if we woke it.

160
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,230
Bonjour, mon ami.
Did it sleep well?

161
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,670
Best.

162
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,990
Excellent. Now we are going to taste
the famous English breakfast.

163
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,670
One serves.

164
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,590
- What he is eating, Hastings?
- I think that he is " Kedgeree ".

165
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,540
It is a rice, nothing has them to me any more.

166
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,750
But, Hastings, who is done
of the famous English breakfast?

167
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,990
Did not it notice the dinner of yesterday?
A small potato for each one.

168
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,860
- A chop...
- But the English dinners are so.

169
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,390
- But the breakfast...
- Will it be that they are badly of finances?

170
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,510
They did not light the hearth
last night in my room.

171
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,830
Call them to all!
lmediatamente!

172
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,350
- All of them, Tredwell!
- Certainly.

173
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,790
- Good morning.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Waverly.

174
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,150
- How his wife is?
- Be still weak, it is not going to get up.

175
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,350
But I have worse news.

176
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,140
See.

177
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,270
In my room itself!

178
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,350
I had a bath,
I did not delay any more than ten minutes.

179
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,430
While returning, it had that in the cushion.

180
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,710
- Only two words: " To I halve it. "
- But that it barks!

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,390
Precisely!

182
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,990
One of my employees
he is a traitor.

183
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,350
- But I know how to take revenge.
- What it intends to do?

184
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,070
I am going to dismiss them, to all they!
Unless one of them is accused.

185
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,270
The Tredwell will be, it works here
since my childhood.

186
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,430
- As well as Beauty queen Collins.
- Beauty queen Collins?

187
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,180
The secretary of my wife,
it is of confidence.

188
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,310
Skies, I do not support traitors!

189
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,910
- The people is brought together.
- Thank you, Tredwell.

190
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,430
Mr. Waverly,
I ask him to reconsider.

191
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,310
The more it discharges the house it will be,
better the scoundrel will be moved.

192
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,350
Stupidities.

193
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,590
Do his work and I do mine
and everything will run well.

194
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,310
But to empty the house
some hours before the kidnapping

195
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,030
it is an illogical attitude.

196
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,270
How does it dare?
Is it calling me crazy?

197
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,750
I do what I consider to be better
to defend my son.

198
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,070
- Allow me to value that.
- I cannot obstruct it.

199
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,110
It is right.

200
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,670
This is obstinate, Hastings.

201
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,870
Mon Dieu! The surprises do not cease.
The Inspector-chief Japp.

202
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,950
- Did it change of ideas, Inspector?
- Yes, one can say that yes.

203
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,110
Or he can call oneself
what a worried amateur did not want to see.

204
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,790
It is very kind, an Inspector-chief.
His heart will be his disgrace.

205
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,030
It is true. Call,
where the simple rural nobleman is?

206
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,030
It is in the hall,
dismissing the employees.

207
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,950
Skies.
Did it wake up with the feet out of the bed?

208
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,540
Perhaps. Bonne chance!

209
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,350
One of you is responsible.

210
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,550
I am waiting for an answer.

211
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,310
Then? I am to the wait.

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,550
- Do not go very fast.
- No, I do not pass of the 80.

213
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,990
- Kilometers?
- Miles.

214
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,700
Happen what will happen,
we will return ás 12:00H.

215
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,430
- I will not be treated in this way!
- There is any more nothing saying.

216
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,390
There is still very much to say it,
Mr. Waverly. I not...

217
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,380
Pack and Beauty queen Collins
he will pay to him his salary.

218
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,510
- And what the Johnnie says to?
- He does not say anything to him.

219
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,990
He now is with Beauty queen Collins.
It is dispensed, Mrs. Withers.

220
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,100
- What it does here?
- Good morning, Mr. Waverly.

221
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,230
It brought some agents with me.
Does it allow to me that it spreads them for the house?

222
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,750
It walked recovering
the mansion of Waverly?

223
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,560
We will return soon,
according to him he says to me.

224
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,990
Only I believe when he will see.
She does not mind very much the house.

225
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,870
- Oh yes?
- No.

226
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,190
For her, the house can fall of rotten one.

227
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,790
It is her that has money,
but for her conduct, it is not noticed.

228
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,310
I want an agent in the way
what is going to give to the cowsheds.

229
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,430
Beacher, for the cowsheds.

230
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,030
- One near the principal entry.
- Osborne, in the principal entry.

231
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,350
- Two in the perimeter.
- George, Smith.

232
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,830
- Someone here near...
- Quarters of the employees.

233
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,190
- And scrambled eggs?
- Clear! And small sausages?

234
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,470
- Yes, clear.
- Seasoned kidneys?

235
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,510
Kidneys, yes. And bacon?

236
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,790
- Estaladiço?
- Clear. And tea?

237
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,030
- Or a beautiful beer?
- Beer? To the breakfast?

238
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,390
- Two mugs, please.
- We will return ás 12:00H.

239
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,590
We have much time.

240
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,710
Certainly, men.

241
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,870
But what admirable young person.

242
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,630
Hastings, the restoration
of Waverly it is going to continue.

243
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,590
I did not trust the builder.
It seems to me that it does not like the Waverly.

244
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,790
Perhaps.

245
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,550
Very well!

246
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,270
The Johnnie will keep me
and you are a joined ás you keep at the window.

247
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,110
- The best.
- The Poirot is near that door.

248
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,950
I do not know if it does well.

249
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,900
If there will be physical confrontation,
you. Poirot is not the best choice.

250
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,310
It works well with the brain,
but badly with the body...

251
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,110
- And his colleague, Hastings?
- So it is well.

252
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,390
Does he know what I think?
I think that they touched the car.

253
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,830
They touched the car
to be released of us.

254
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,590
Since the fact is that they knew
that we were going to use the car?

255
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,950
When it took care. With knack, Johnnie.
It makes him festive very slowly.

256
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,630
She likes.

257
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,670
She likes you.

258
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,350
- How you are now, wanted?
- I am much better.

259
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,750
It is necessary to have been something that I ate.

260
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,350
Let you be in the bed, it rests.
I am going to take the Johnnie down.

261
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,350
- Because it cannot be here?
- Down there he is better.

262
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,390
Beauty queen Collins keeps you.

263
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,430
- Goodbye, wanted.
- We go.

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,540
- Does not it need even me?
- No, keep my wife.

265
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,220
- During half an hour only.
- Goodbye, mother.

266
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,750
Goodbye.

267
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,630
- Well, it is not the carburator.
- It is not that that I want to hear.

268
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,300
I want to know what it is
and not what is not.

269
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,310
Better still,
I want to hear the motor!

270
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,190
Whistle two times
if someone will be captured.

271
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,910
- Are they all in his positions?
- Yes.

272
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,270
- Where the Poirot hid?
- They went out from car when I arrived.

273
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,270
Sergeant,
maintain the agents in alert.

274
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Of car? Does he know for where they were?

275
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,630
They did not say to me, unfortunately.

276
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,790
We caught it!

277
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,590
It was in the middle of the shrubs.

278
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,270
It had the whole material with him.

279
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,580
See, Inspector.

280
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,430
- Does it know this man?
- I never saw it before.

281
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,910
What beautiful order.
A bottle of chloroform, cotton,

282
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,030
and an addressed letter
to you, Mr. Waverly.

283
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,190
I do not know of anything,
they asked for me to hand over him.

284
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,030
- Who?
- A man.

285
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,350
A man whom I found,
on the road.

286
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,190
" He must have paid. The redemption
of his son thousand starts to belong of 70.

287
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,910
" In spite of his precautions,
he was kidnapped ás 12:00H of the day 29,

288
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,070
" such as I promised. "

289
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,110
Must he have paid? It finds what can...

290
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,540
Johnnie.

291
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,950
I halve it!

292
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,550
Mon Dieu! What a pain!

293
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,340
Is it going to do anything or not?

294
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,590
When the height to arrive,
the Poirot will act.

295
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,030
But what problemazinho pleasant.
Obscure and enchanting.

296
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,230
We were deceived
thanks to an advanced clock.

297
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,030
Pleasant? Enchanting?

298
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,310
My son was kidnapped!

299
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,870
Yes, me them he is well.

300
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,990
Rest, these scoundrels
they are going to treat very well him.

301
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,110
He is not, for them,
the hen of the golden eggs?

302
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,230
Nobody knows the car.

303
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,940
I gave the description to the Police officer of Surrey,
but he must have exchanged of car.

304
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,750
- Or then it was for in far.
- And is it it brutal what got a beating?

305
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,350
One calls Joe Rogers, according to him.
It maintains his version of the history.

306
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,630
Perhaps the Poirot manages to convince.

307
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,500
With all the respect, if mine
agents him did not go round...

308
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,910
Poirot is going to act.

309
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,550
Captain Hastings,
is the vehicle repaired?

310
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,870
It had no petrol, imagine.
The indicator is damaged.

311
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,910
- We have work. The kid was kidnapped.
- I know, one of the agents told me.

312
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,220
- Bonjour, Monsieur Rogers.
- Look there!

313
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,630
He is greeting it,
his ignorant one.

314
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,780
Tell to me again his history.

315
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,670
Since the fact is that the order
did it him come to stop ás hands?

316
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,030
I already told everything to him.

317
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,390
- But tell me to me.
- Well, it was handed over me by a so-and-so.

318
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,670
- Oh yes?
- Was not it what I said?

319
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,870
And what the so-and-so said to him?

320
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,430
I called myself to hand over the order
at the big home.

321
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,790
In the side door, he said.
It gave me a note of a shilling.

322
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,910
I called myself to hand over it
to 11:50H, in point.

323
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,760
He knows to what hours
did it meet with him?

324
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,550
By chance even I know. They were 10:15H.

325
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,390
And does it manage to describe it?

326
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,030
He had something of stranger.
It was not high, it was of my size.

327
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,910
- And it had " ears ".
- "Do" you "ear"?

328
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,510
Moustache.

329
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,910
And it was bringing a grey uniform,
with gaiters and a hat.

330
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,070
Like a driver?

331
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,070
- Which age did he have?
- I do not know.

332
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,870
But it is curious,
it had a very strange voice.

333
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,270
He knows this type that walks thereabouts
put on as morning suit?

334
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,430
- It of erect nose?
- Erect nose? Morning suit?

335
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,340
Yes, is he a butler?
Well, he had a son,

336
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,910
it would be the accomplished face
of this so-and-so whom I found.

337
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,950
- Like the son of the Mr. Tredwell!
- Do not be filled with enthusiasm, Poirot.

338
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,230
The Tredwell was with you. Waverly
between them 10:00H and them 10:30H.

339
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,710
- You. Waverly it already confirmed me.
- But will it be that he has a son?

340
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,040
Then there will be another explanation.

341
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,190
Thank you, Mr. Japp.
It was of extreme usefulness.

342
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,750
- And you also, Mr. Rogers.
- Well, very much thank you.

343
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,870
Leave there that, man,
I am going to take it to the local squad.

344
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,990
- Accused of what?
- Begging.

345
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,190
- It cannot, I have a shilling.
- Say that to a magistrate.

346
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,580
We go.

347
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,660
I am going for London to organize the search.

348
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,030
The answer is here, I make friends,
it is not in London.

349
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,350
It can be, Mr. Poirot,
but the boy is in London.

350
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,160
Of that I am sure.
To pass well.

351
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,990
Mr. Tredwell, between.
Between and one feels.

352
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,910
- I prefer to be in foot, already now.
- Clear.

353
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,830
- Work here there are many years?
- There is 30.

354
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,910
I began for bass.
In this time, there was more personal.

355
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,310
If someone knows the secrets
of the family, this someone is you.

356
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,550
I guarantee him that this family
it has no secrets.

357
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,070
- Clear what not.
- You. Waverly is very correct.

358
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,870
- Such as his father.
- Clear.

359
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,910
And Lady Waverly?
Do they have a happy marriage?

360
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,270
Certainly,
she is the best woman.

361
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,510
It is right that it did alterations.

362
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,630
She was not educated in this environment,
in spite of being a rich woman.

363
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,390
It is true.

364
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,700
I find them to myself what begins to value
to this way of life.

365
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,950
Beauty queen Collins,
talk to me about the nursemaid of the boy.

366
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,150
- It was here there are six months.
- Was it of confidence?

367
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,350
Of extreme confidence, I deduct.

368
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,670
Me them she was already not here
in the height of the kidnapping.

369
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,870
It is true, it is right.

370
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,270
But it could have accomplices at the home.

371
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,670
She had a stronger friendship
with another employee?

372
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,590
I do not do idea.
I do not take notice of gossip, he knows.

373
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,950
Clear, it was not intending to suggest...

374
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,470
Excuse,
he did not know that they here were still.

375
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,270
It does not do badly, we were finishing.
Beauty queen Collins.

376
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,790
- Is he sure?
- Yes. Very much thank you.

377
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,220
Merci, Mademoiselle.

378
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,030
- Did it discover anything?
- And you?

379
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,350
- You. Tredwell said to me great thing.
- Well then?

380
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,430
- Only I do not understand a thing.
- I do not understand anything.

381
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,550
No, my friend, is simple.
Only there is a detail.

382
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,790
The child was here,
it was in this division,

383
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,550
watched by the father
and for the Inspector-chief Japp.

384
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,990
The false alarm was given

385
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,430
and the Inspector and the Waverly
they went out irreflectidamente,

386
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,940
leaving the undefended child.
Truth?

387
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,220
- Yes.
- Bon.

388
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,310
The kidnapper enters and takes the child.

389
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,190
- For where?
- I do not understand.

390
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,390
They could not go out this way.
The Inspector and the Waverly had gone out

391
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,990
and a police officer was still
her around 20 meters from here.

392
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,670
This way, yes.

393
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,990
But for where it would follow?

394
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,110
The entry of the house was watched,
as well as the rears.

395
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,190
The Rogers was caught from this side
of the house and the agitation it was reigning.

396
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,910
- Is it a problem, no?
- I am understanding.

397
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,910
- The tunnel.
- Comment?

398
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,830
- The tunnel.
- Which tunnel?

399
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,430
Many catholics' houses
they had passages for priests.

400
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,670
The men were used when
of the King they were looking for the priests.

401
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,590
Where it is the tunnel?

402
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,510
Sacre bleu!

403
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,110
- Where is it going to give?
- To the mausoleum, to 1 km from here.

404
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,790
I need a lampe of poche.
How he calls himself? A battery?

405
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,510
- Lantern of pocket?
- A lantern!

406
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,590
- I have one in the car.
- Bon.

407
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,220
- Who knows of the existence of this?
- I do not know for certain.

408
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,620
Some persons whom they visited
the house, but especially relatives.

409
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,390
- I understand. And the employees?
- One or two, perhaps.

410
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,670
- Beauty queen Collins?
- No, I am sure.

411
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,780
- And the Tredwell?
- Must know, live already here there has much.

412
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,950
- The nursemaid of the child, you. Withers?
- I find that not. No.

413
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,900
- Take, one for each one.
- The best.

414
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,590
Captain, we are going to start
a travel for the darkness.

415
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,310
- I go with you.
- No, we go alone.

416
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,750
It has a few staircases.

417
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,070
In front, mon brave.

418
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,390
- Say, which conclusions it takes away?
- About the darkness I do not manage to think.

419
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,580
But it is in the darkness that the cells
grey better they work.

420
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,550
We always return to the same question.

421
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,620
Because it are what the kidnapper warned
the family?

422
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,990
It was counting to be paid
without kidnap the child.

423
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,190
That does not alter the fact
of what they made difficult a simple thing.

424
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,600
If they did not specify
an hour and a date,

425
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,460
it would be easy the opportunity waits
of taking the child

426
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,950
when she was with the nursemaid.

427
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,750
I find that yes.

428
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,630
I already see light there to the front.

429
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,350
The best. I am full of this tunnel.

430
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,990
Snooper. Very funny.

431
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,950
The car could wait here.
It is already removed of the house.

432
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,110
They could bring the child
for the tunnel even to the car.

433
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,870
The driver whistles
while it comes to the house.

434
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,390
Everything does not pass of a farce!

435
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,670
Everything indicates that there was an accomplice
inside the house.

436
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,430
- The poisoning of the Mrs. Waverly...
- Poisoning?

437
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,380
My poor person Hastings!
And so innocent.

438
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,670
No, it is touching.

439
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,830
It finds them to me same
what was acidentalmente

440
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,990
what you. Waverly was dispatched
in the day of the kidnapping?

441
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,070
- Saint Deus!
- Second question...

442
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,990
Someone of the house put the message
in the cushion of the Waverly.

443
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,780
- Yes, it does sense.
- Third question...

444
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,990
Advancing the clock ten minutes.
Completely done by someone from the house.

445
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,390
There were four persons at the home.

446
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,750
You. Waverly and Beauty queen Collins
they are out of question.

447
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,710
The wife was...
How he calls himself alite?

448
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,910
Arranged in layers, is it that?
It was accompanied by Beauty queen Collins.

449
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,310
- They remain you. Waverly and the Tredwell.
- It is true.

450
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,110
Hastings,
I am already full of this case.

451
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,270
From here to 40 minutes it breaks a train
for London.

452
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,950
- I take it the London...
- No, Hastings, I go of train.

453
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,030
Where does it go?

454
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,630
The Captain volunteered
to take me to the station.

455
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,790
- Then I follow to London.
- And the case? My son?

456
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,150
- It did not do anything!
- On the contrary, already I did everything.

457
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,310
Then, where he is?

458
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,590
I am going to give him the address.

459
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,510
- The leaf is blank.
- I wait what writes the address.

460
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,990
It is going to take me to me and to a Captain
even next to the boy. Now.

461
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,590
Opposite case, his wife
it will be informed of the events

462
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,070
what compose this ignoble crime.

463
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,390
He is well.

464
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,790
- It is treated well.
- Of that I have no doubts.

465
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,710
Jessie!

466
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,910
Father!

467
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,220
Father!

468
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,230
The nursemaid of the Johnnie, is clear. Clear!

469
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,070
- She is the daughter of the Mr. Tredwell?
- Niece.

470
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,430
His skill will allow him
to explain the appearance of the boy.

471
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,990
It was not found what, in the bottom,
he is a good father,

472
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,350
it would not be disposed
giving him another opportunity.

473
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,230
I do everything to avoid a scandal.

474
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,990
Precisely.

475
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,750
It is the appearances that count.

476
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,590
Therefore his wife did not tolerate what
it was stopping the restoration of the house.

477
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,220
To have a rich wife
there is not the same thing as to be rich.

478
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,630
Do not be preoccupied.

479
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,670
- I learnt my lesson.
- The best.

480
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,550
It has an ancient and honest name.
Does not put it again at risk.

481
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,030
Then I send to him my count.

482
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,030
We go, Captain Hastings.

483
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,030
Tell to me the secret.
It is how what it discovered?

484
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,510
It was obvious.
Who dismissed the employees?

485
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,710
Who could write the messages?
To drug the wife?

486
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,830
Who could advance the clock?

487
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,470
Who could give an alibi
to his loyal servant, the Tredwell?

488
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,030
Tredwell never liked the mistress,

489
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,390
but it is dedicated to a Mr. Waverly.

490
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,070
Be three wrapped ones:
