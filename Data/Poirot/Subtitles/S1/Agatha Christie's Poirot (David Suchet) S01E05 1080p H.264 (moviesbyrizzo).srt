1
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,249
You can pour that cup of tea
now, darling!

2
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,791
This is the last bit!

3
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,999
Right you are, dear.

4
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,666
Wouldn't mind having your job,
mate --

5
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:52,833
standing there,
doing nothing all day.

6
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,374
No, easy, now.

7
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:57,583
And mind the paintwork!

8
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,083
Oh, you and your
bloody paintwork.

9
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,166
Leave it there, thank you.

10
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,874
And could we have a signature,
please?

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,416
Certainly.

12
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,916
Oh, mon Dieu.
Ca suffit.

13
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,249
Ah, Mr. Poirot.

14
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,833
You've only done seven minutes.

15
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,791
You'll never cure your cold if
you don't obey the instructions.

16
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:20,166
I can't imagine a method
so undignified

17
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,791
can cure anything, Miss Lemon.

18
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,416
And now once more I have
the backache, eh?

19
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,333
Has the post come, Miss Lemon?

20
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,041
Yes, and I'm afraid
there was nothing for you.

21
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,166
Oh.

22
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,708
It's only been three weeks
since your last case.

23
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,499
Three weeks is an eternity
to a brain like mine.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,708
Without the constant
stimulation,

25
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,916
my little gray cells
will starve and die.

26
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,708
Already you can see
I am suffering the effects.

27
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,208
There's a letter for you.

28
00:04:58,917 --> 00:04:59,958
Read it.

29
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,583
"Dear Miss Matthews,
I am the new tenant of 36B,

30
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,333
directly below you.

31
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,958
I wonder if I might have a word
at your earliest convenience.

32
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,666
Ernestine Grant, Mrs."

33
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,749
It sounds a bit ominous.
What could she want?

34
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,791
Lord knows.

35
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,499
Have you clapped eyes on her?

36
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,374
Probably a complaint about
the gramophone or something.

37
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,624
How's the cold, old boy?

38
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,833
And now also you're trying to
give me the heart attack?

39
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,791
I wouldn't be surprised
if riding in that car

40
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,291
was not responsible
for my present malady.

41
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,208
She's much too much of a lady
to give anyone a cold.

42
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,333
She's running like a bird since
I fitted those new gaskets.

43
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,124
Birds do not run, Hastings.

44
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416
When you were little, you
should have paid more attention

45
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,208
to your lessons in biology.

46
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,583
You're really in a bad way,
aren't you?

47
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,499
Well, my friend
as one approaches the end,

48
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,416
one begins to see life
as it truly is.

49
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,624
Don't worry.

50
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,541
I've got something
that'll cheer you up.

51
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,583
Really?

52
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:08,791
A couple of tickets
for "The Deadly Shroud."

53
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:09,833
Hmm?

54
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,833
You know, the new murder mystery
at Wyndham's.

55
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,124
Oh, my dear Hastings,
that is most kind,

56
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,166
but how can a mere stage play
be compared

57
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,249
to the real-life cases
of Hercule Poirot?

58
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,624
Tell you what --

59
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,999
I'll wager you 10 quid you can't
solve "The Deadly Shroud."

60
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,374
You on?

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,749
Well, the money, of course,
is of no importance.

62
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,208
But I find your challenge
irresistible.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,999
I accept.

64
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,124
Oh, it's you.

65
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,791
You better come in.

66
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,208
Mother!
Are you all right?

67
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,999
Oh, my God!

68
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,708
Help her, someone!

69
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,499
Lady Muriel?

70
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,124
She's dead.

71
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,083
It was the sherry, of course.

72
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,166
What was?

73
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,874
That killed Lady Muriel.

74
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,999
The sherry -- it was poisoned.

75
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,083
Oh. Do you think so?

76
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,583
Mm.

77
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,749
I think that Mrs. Sadler
is looking pretty suspicious.

78
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,124
No, no, no.

79
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,333
Ah.

80
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,999
Whiskey?

81
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,124
No, thank you.

82
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,416
Now, don't open this now --
only at the end.

83
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,416
What is it?

84
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,624
The name of the murderer,
of course.

85
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:02,874
Ah.

86
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,374
It's Mlle. Matthews.

87
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,958
Over there, Hastings,
the girl in the red dress --

88
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:15,291
she lives in the flat below me
in Whitehaven Mansions.

89
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,541
An enchanting mademoiselle,
n'est-ce pas?

90
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,083
Yes.

91
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:26,124
The question of motive has had
me worried, I can tell you.

92
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:33,458
Why should anyone want to kill
Lady Muriel?

93
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:38,458
Who would gain by her death?

94
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,791
The answer, ladies
and gentlemen, is nobody.

95
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,916
Hmm.

96
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,291
Why?

97
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,083
Because Lady Muriel
was never the intended victim.

98
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,041
No.

99
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,291
The person who should have drunk
the poisoned sherry,

100
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,416
the person for whom
it was intended,

101
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,833
was the missing son and heir

102
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,041
who stood to inherit
Lady Muriel's fortune --

103
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,374
Major Sadler.

104
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,624
Only one other person
in this room

105
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,499
knew of this well-kept secret

106
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,791
and stood to gain from
the major's death -- his wife.

107
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:31,041
Am I not correct, Mrs. Sadler?

108
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:33,749
Oh!

109
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,791
Oh, but that's -- that's absurd.

110
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,583
The writer is an imbecile.

111
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,624
Oh, yes, Mrs. Sadler,
your plan was clever --

112
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,458
so clever that it
almost had me fooled.

113
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,124
But I noticed that...

114
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,749
...what did happen
to the missing glass.

115
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,374
Perhaps it is time I retire,
Hastings.

116
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,208
I say, Poirot, you're beginning
to make me feel badly

117
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:04,249
about all this.

118
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,791
No, no, no, no, not at all.

119
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,916
Hercule Poirot
is a man of his word,

120
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,333
even if the playwright is not.

121
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,333
We were not given all the facts.

122
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,666
It was only at the end
that we discover

123
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,916
that Major Sadler
is Lady Muriel's son.

124
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,499
And that theater has made
my cold even worse.

125
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,374
Of course I did.
I got it at the end of act one.

126
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:43,249
I knew it was that Mr. Sadler
right from the beginning.

127
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,291
Takes one to know one,
I suppose.

128
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,874
It was that dress she wore
in the first act.

129
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,458
I mean, it was so -- Ugh.

130
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,958
Oh, I can't find my key.

131
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:54,458
Perhaps you just forgot
to bring it, darling.

132
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:55,541
Of course I didn't.

133
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,749
I'm not a complete nincompoop,
Donovan.

134
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,999
I always bring my key.

135
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,958
Actually, I saw her put it
in her bag before we left.

136
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:01,999
There, you see?

137
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,874
The point is,
how are we going to get in?

138
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,833
Well, the night porter
will be off duty now.

139
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,208
Donovan, darling, you wouldn't
care to be a cat burglar,

140
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:08,249
would you?

141
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,291
No, Pat.

142
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,666
I think even among cat burglars,

143
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,374
a fourth-floor flat
might be regarded

144
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,916
as rather
a reckless proposition.

145
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,374
Is there a fire escape?

146
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:17,999
No, but there's a coal vent.

147
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,208
That's a point.

148
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,083
It's loaded
in the basement of the flats

149
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,083
and goes up to a hatch
in the kitchen.

150
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,749
We put the dustbins on it,
as well, and send them down.

151
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,041
Won't the hatch be bolted?

152
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,708
I never really bother
to bolt mine.

153
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:30,749
It's too stiff.

154
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,833
Well, it's worth a try,
wouldn't you say?

155
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,208
Absolutely.

156
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,458
Oh, really, my dear chap,
it's not necessary.

157
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,916
Only a bit of fun, you know.

158
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,291
No, no, no, no, no.

159
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,041
£10 we agreed.

160
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,416
£10 it shall be.

161
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:07,958
Qui est-ce?

162
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,833
The carrier?
It is late to put out a dustbin.

163
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:28,916
Hastings, be so kind
as to extinguish the light.

164
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,499
This'll be it.

165
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,999
Are you sure?

166
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:43,291
Of course I'm bloody sure.

167
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,958
Put the light on.

168
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,999
No, they won't work.

169
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,416
Try the sitting room.

170
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,749
All right.

171
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:06,999
Looks like burglars.

172
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,666
No, no, no, I do not think so.

173
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,458
They are wearing
the evening dress.

174
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,666
Un moment.

175
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,208
What on earth's Pat been up to?

176
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,291
Everything's in the wrong
bloody place.

177
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,624
This isn't Pat's flat.

178
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,833
Jeepers.

179
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,166
"Mrs. Ernestine Grant."

180
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,708
Oh, Lord, we're in 36B, not 46B.

181
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,791
I suggest we get out of here
before she finds us.

182
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,374
Look.

183
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,166
Good God.

184
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,374
What are we going to do?

185
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,208
I don't know.

186
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,666
Pat! Mildred!

187
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,541
Something's happened.

188
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,083
What is it?

189
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,666
There's a dead woman down here.

190
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,499
Oh, my God.

191
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,874
Jimmy?

192
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,583
Uh, this is Jimmy Faulkner,
M. Poirot.

193
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,041
Ah, bon soir, M. Faulkner.

194
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,041
Not the M. Poirot?

195
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,791
Well...

196
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,958
Yes, he lives in the flat
above me.

197
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,208
Oh, gosh, I didn't know.
This is an honor, sir.

198
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,583
Well, thank you.

199
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,249
You see, Hastings?

200
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,041
I am still a force
to be calculated.

201
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:12,291
So, the doors were unbolted.

202
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,624
You walk across the kitchen.

203
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,249
And you say the light
did not switch on.

204
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,374
No, the bulb had gone
or something.

205
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:28,999
Ah.

206
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,124
How very odd.

207
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,374
Maybe there's
a loose connection.

208
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,333
Or perhaps the bulb
has been replaced.

209
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:52,458
We heard that sound before, sir.

210
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,166
It is the domestic, the maid.

211
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,666
We will let her sleep
for the moment.

212
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,374
You better watch your step,
lads.

213
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,083
This is where
the famous private detective

214
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,791
Mr. Hercule Poirot lives.

215
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,583
So, Donovan and I came in here.

216
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:56,958
I mean, we still thought we were
in Miss Matthew's flat.

217
00:19:57,334 --> 00:20:00,249
And then we put the light on
and realized we weren't,

218
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,999
and then we saw the body.

219
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,249
Ah.

220
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,124
She has been dead for some time.

221
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,541
What, hours, do you mean?

222
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,583
What is that on your hand?

223
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,791
What?

224
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,166
Oh. What's that?

225
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
My God, I think it's blood.

226
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,583
Did you touch the body?

227
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,791
No!

228
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,874
So, the crime was committed
at the table...

229
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,666
and then the body was moved
to the window.

230
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,708
It is blood.

231
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,374
Hastings, be so kind
as to go downstairs

232
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,124
and ask M. Dicker what time

233
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,249
the last post was delivered
this evening.

234
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,333
Right.

235
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:46,708
Hastings.

236
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,916
Japp.

237
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,958
Ah, my dear
Chief Inspector Japp.

238
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:53,583
You'll be having murders in your
back bedroom next, Poirot.

239
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,416
Right.
Who's the victim?

240
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,041
Mrs. Ernestine Grant.

241
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,458
Apparently, she only moved in
to the flat today.

242
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,833
And how was the body found?

243
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:09,083
Well, I'm afraid that's rather
a long story, Chief Inspector.

244
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,458
It would be.

245
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:14,749
I shall want statements
from everybody.

246
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,583
Omelet for you, Mildred?

247
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:25,666
Oh, I couldn't.

248
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,583
I suppose you're inured to this
sort of thing, M. Poirot?

249
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:31,583
No, no, no, on the contrary.
I think it is very nice.

250
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,791
You know, Mlle. Patricia,

251
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,791
I once loved a very young,
beautiful English girl

252
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,374
who resembled you greatly.

253
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,166
But, alas, she could not cook.

254
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,958
And the relationship withered.

255
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:48,541
No, I meant -- Well, you know,
poor Mrs. Grant and everything.

256
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,958
Mlle. Patricia,
a little bread, perhaps?

257
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,541
Mm.

258
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,791
It is essential
to keep up the strength

259
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:58,874
of my little gray cells.

260
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,541
You seem a little better, sir.

261
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,374
Thank you.
I am feeling better.

262
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,999
Doesn't seem real at all.

263
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,374
It's like a little play
or something.

264
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,291
A better play, I trust, than
the farrago we saw this evening.

265
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:11,416
Oh, didn't you like it?

266
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:13,416
Oh, we all thought
it was terrific.

267
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,541
Ah, I beg to differ --
on the contrary.

268
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,416
We were not given all the facts.

269
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,833
The facts, as presented,
pointed to Chivers, the butler.

270
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,291
Oh, do you think so, sir?

271
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:23,583
There's no question.

272
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,624
Consider his position.

273
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,041
He was the only person who had
the motive and the opportunity

274
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,333
to poison the sherry.

275
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:30,541
And then the writer

276
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,458
has this character
of a simple, plodding policeman

277
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,666
speaking a windbag
of the summing up

278
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,041
and resting his whole case
on the infantile subplot --

279
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,916
The door was open.

280
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:42,958
Come in, Inspector.

281
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,833
Well, it looks like
a pretty cut-and-dried matter.

282
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,041
Not worth your while,
I'm afraid, Poirot.

283
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,166
But that woman's Mrs. Grant,
all right.

284
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,416
The maid identified her.

285
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,791
She was shot at the table

286
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,999
with a small-caliber
automatic pistol.

287
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,874
She fell forward, which accounts
for the blood on the cloth.

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,333
So, somebody actually
shot her in cold blood?

289
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,374
That's the way it looks, sir,
yes.

290
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,833
How dreadful.

291
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,249
And the time of death?

292
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,291
The doctor estimates
between five and six hours ago.

293
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,624
None of you noticed
anyone unusual in the flats

294
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
around that time, I suppose?

295
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,624
Mildred arrived
just after lunch,

296
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,499
and we didn't go out until Jimmy
and Donovan came to collect us

297
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,749
for the theater at about 7:00,
wasn't it?

298
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,749
Mm.

299
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,208
And you got back at what time?

300
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,749
Oh, 10:30 or so.

301
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,583
What does the maid say?

302
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:28,333
Ah, Miss Trotter.

303
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,541
Excuse me.

304
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,791
I assume she had
the evening off.

305
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,583
She went out at 5:00
and got back about 10:00,

306
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,874
letting herself in
with her own key.

307
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,624
She noticed nothing unusual?

308
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,583
She thought her mistress
was in bed --

309
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,916
never thought to look
behind the packing cases.

310
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,499
That's very curious.

311
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,874
Curious?

312
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,374
To try and hide the body.

313
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,874
Didn't want the crime discovered
until he made his getaway.

314
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,249
Perhaps.

315
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:00,333
Well, mm, but...

316
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,416
Oh, pardon.

317
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,708
Please continue,
Chief Inspector.

318
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,708
Well, we found this
on the floor,

319
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,541
dropped in his haste, I expect.

320
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,499
Take a look at the corner,
Poirot.

321
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:15,499
"J.F."

322
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,124
That's right -- "J.F."

323
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,208
Now take a look at this.

324
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:23,124
This was found in the pocket
of the dead woman's dress.

325
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,249
"If it suits you,
I will come this evening.

326
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,416
Shall we say 6:00?

327
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,749
Frazer."

328
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,083
An incriminating document
for this Frazer.

329
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,708
Oh, I think we may take it

330
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:42,416
that J.F. and Frazer
are one and the same.

331
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,333
A John Frazer, perhaps.

332
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,541
We'll get a line on him
in due course.

333
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,416
Chief Inspector, sir?

334
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:56,708
Miss Trotter here was wondering
if she can go home now, sir.

335
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,166
I'm going to stay at my
sister's, if that's all right.

336
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,458
I couldn't sleep here,
not tonight. I couldn't.

337
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,624
Yes, that'll be all right
for now.

338
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,999
Oh, thank you, sir.

339
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,333
Excuse me, mademoiselle.

340
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,583
Yes, sir?

341
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,833
Permit me, if I may,
to ask you the question.

342
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,208
Yes, sir.

343
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,583
When you returned to the flat

344
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:14,458
belonging to Mrs. Grant
this evening,

345
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,124
did you enter the sitting room?

346
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,166
Oh, yes, sir.

347
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,624
I collected the evening post
on my way up,

348
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,708
and I left the letters for Mrs.
Grant on the sitting-room table.

349
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,749
And you noticed nothing strange
in that room?

350
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,374
No, sir, nothing.

351
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,041
Thank you very much,
mademoiselle.

352
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,249
Thank you, sir.

353
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,666
Good night.

354
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,958
Ah, Poirot.

355
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:42,999
Apparently, the last post
arrived at 9:00 this evening.

356
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,124
Thank you, Hastings.

357
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,499
And according to Dicker,

358
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,583
nobody out of the ordinary came
in and out of the building

359
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:48,833
all night.

360
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:49,916
Uh-huh.

361
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:53,333
Inspector, please.

362
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,041
A little favor, if I may.

363
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,541
Here we go.

364
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,874
I would like to examine the flat
belonging to Mrs. Grant.

365
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,666
There's nothing there, Poirot.

366
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,041
Well...

367
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,374
I've put out a call
for this John Frazer.

368
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,499
We find him,
that's the end of it.

369
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,999
As you say.

370
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,166
Well, then.

371
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:22,041
Oh, examine it
as much as you like.

372
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:38,791
You all right?

373
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,499
I'm all right.

374
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,749
You're shivering.
You must be cold.

375
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,333
It's just this terrible thing
with Mrs. Grant.

376
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,208
I know.

377
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,541
We were having
such a lovely evening.

378
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,374
And we'll have lots more
lovely evenings.

379
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,874
Do you see that?

380
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,041
Hmm?

381
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,624
They're taking her away.

382
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,083
Shocking business.

383
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,749
And she only moved in
this morning.

384
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,416
Let us, my friends,
consider the facts.

385
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:38,916
First, the letter, which was
found at the scene of the crime

386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,916
and with the name John Frazer
written on the bottom.

387
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,374
Then the handkerchief

388
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,499
with the monogram "J.F."
marked on one corner.

389
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,749
So, it would appear --
Would it not, my friends? --

390
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,291
that this man, John Frazer,
was careless, n'est-ce pas?

391
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,333
Mm.

392
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:10,416
Poirot, why are you rummaging
around in the dustbin?

393
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,999
Aha.

394
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,041
I thought so.

395
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,999
Voilà.

396
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,458
Pardon.
I have a cold.

397
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,124
Would you be so kind,
M. Donovan?

398
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,458
Thank you.

399
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,833
Oh, no, no, no!

400
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,374
Why did he take off the lid?
That is stupid!

401
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,833
Jimmy, fetch some brandy,
if you please --

402
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,083
in the sitting room, I think.

403
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,499
Hastings...

404
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,416
What happened?

405
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,749
Here. Drink this, my friend.

406
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,708
You are fortunate, M. Bailey.

407
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,624
It could have been worse --
even poison, perhaps.

408
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,458
You must be more careful.

409
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,708
It kicked like a mule.

410
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,708
Feeling any better?

411
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,249
I think so, thanks.

412
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:16,874
Ohh.

413
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,249
Oh, mon Dieu.

414
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,708
Hastings, take him upstairs
to the flat, huh?

415
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,374
Perhaps prepare for him
some coffee.

416
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,291
I'm sure I'll be fine now,
thanks.

417
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,208
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I insist.

418
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,874
You are still weak, yes?

419
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,083
I suppose I do feel a bit wonky
still.

420
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,166
Better come along, old chap,
take it easy for a bit.

421
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,249
Ohh.

422
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,249
Hastings, make sure M. Bailey
is very comfortable,

423
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,249
because, Hastings...
I am anxious for his health.

424
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,499
Right.

425
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,958
So, what now, sir?

426
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,208
Now, Jimmy?

427
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,124
Nothing.

428
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,416
The case is finished.

429
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,708
Finished?

430
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:18,499
Oh, yes, my friend.

431
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:23,374
I now know everything.

432
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,416
I don't understand, sir.

433
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,041
Have they arrested
this Frazer chap already?

434
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,583
There is no Frazer chap.

435
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,083
He is the name only,

436
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,666
the name carefully marked
on a handkerchief,

437
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:06,749
the name written on the bottom
of a letter,

438
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:09,624
which was placed in the pocket
of the dead woman,

439
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,708
where we would find it.

440
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:11,749
Good lord.

441
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,791
But who changed the light bulb
in the kitchen, then?

442
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,624
No one. The light --
it works to perfection.

443
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,583
It was a ruse to get you
into this sitting room.

444
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,624
Come. I show you.

445
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,916
You see, Jimmy,
with the light on,

446
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:31,708
it is obvious at once

447
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,583
that this is not the kitchen
of Mlle. Patricia.

448
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,291
You would have had no reason

449
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,666
to go into the sitting room,
would you?

450
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:38,874
-No.
-No.

451
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,291
Jimmy, what is this?

452
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,333
The key to this flat?

453
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,291
No.

454
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,833
It is the key
to the flat upstairs,

455
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:50,458
the key
to Mlle. Patricia's flat.

456
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,749
M. Bailey stole this key, Jimmy,
from her bag,

457
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:57,041
and I presume sometime
during the evening.

458
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,124
Donovan stole it?

459
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,166
Yes.

460
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,416
What on earth for?

461
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,374
To prevent you all from going
into her flat

462
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,583
when you came back
from the theater.

463
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:04,666
But why would he want --

464
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,708
Mon Dieu!

465
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,916
To drive you
into this flat instead!

466
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,791
To drive you, my friend,
into the service lift.

467
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,833
But where did you find the key?

468
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,999
Where I expected to find it --
in the pocket of M. Bailey.

469
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,791
You see, Jimmy, I only pretended
to find this bottle

470
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,624
in the rubbish bin.

471
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,041
I had it in my pocket
all the time.

472
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,791
But I hand it to M. Bailey.

473
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,208
He sniffs it and -- Pff!

474
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,083
In this bottle
is ethyl chloride,

475
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:44,374
a most powerful
instant anesthetic.

476
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:49,083
So, for the few moments,
M. Bailey is unconscious.

477
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:51,916
But it is time enough,

478
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,666
while you are in this room,
to fetch the brandy...

479
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,666
for me to take the two items
from M. Bailey's pocket

480
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,458
that I knew I would find there.

481
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:03,833
Yes, but --

482
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,291
Now, now, now, now, patience,
my friend,

483
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,416
and you will learn everything.

484
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:09,791
I ask myself,

485
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,583
"Why hide the body
behind the packing cases?"

486
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,249
To gain time?

487
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,708
Yes.

488
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:24,416
But for the very special reason.

489
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,583
You see, Jimmy,
earlier this evening,

490
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:31,458
the murderer entered this flat
in order to take something, huh?

491
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,291
But that something was nowhere
to be found,

492
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,833
so it was necessary for him
to return,

493
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,041
but only after the last post
was delivered.

494
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:43,374
So, he had to hide the body
behind the curtain.

495
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,208
Then Mlle. Trotter,
the domestic, enters,

496
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,833
sees nothing unusual, places
the last post on the table,

497
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,624
and retires to bed.

498
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,166
And what's that letter then,
sir?

499
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:00,833
Ah, this letter, Jimmy?

500
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,708
This was the second item I took
from M. Bailey's pocket.

501
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,208
It was this letter that he was
so desperate to find.

502
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,291
Are you saying, then, that
Donovan murdered Mrs. Grant?

503
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,666
Exactement.

504
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:20,458
But why?

505
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,124
He didn't even know Mrs. Grant.

506
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,916
Why should he want to kill her?

507
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,374
Ah.

508
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,124
Jimmy, before I tell you,

509
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:35,999
allow me to ask you a question.

510
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,624
It is a most personal one.

511
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,583
Are you in love
with Mlle. Patricia?

512
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,208
Oh, come on, come on, come on.
Don't be shy.

513
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,499
If I were your age, monsieur,

514
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,416
without doubt, I, too,
would be in love with her.

515
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,958
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
I care for Pat damnably,

516
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,249
but of course
she's engaged to Donovan.

517
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,083
Well, she will need you
once his trouble is known.

518
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,124
How do you mean?

519
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,458
Once this case becomes public,
Jimmy,

520
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,333
it will be very difficult

521
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:09,458
to keep her name out of it
entirely.

522
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,833
You see, Mlle. Patricia
was the motive for the murder.

523
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,541
Poirot!

524
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:18,708
Vite!

525
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,916
Poirot, he's made a dash for it!

526
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,333
Constable, stop that man
in the lift. Hurry.

527
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,416
And you, Jimmy.

528
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,333
Well, there's not a sign of him
out there, sir.

529
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,583
That's dashed odd.
He can't have got far.

530
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:47,124
Ah, your friend is not a fool,
M. Faulkner.

531
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,999
He presses the button
inside the lift,

532
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,458
but does not descend himself --
voilà.

533
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,249
Quick -- the basement!

534
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,291
He's down there.

535
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,458
Nothing here.

536
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:53,291
Must have been something else
we heard, M. Poirot.

537
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,916
I think we'd better go back
upstairs, eh?

538
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,833
Nothing around the back, sir?

539
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,041
Not a thing.

540
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,124
He just disappeared,
disappeared altogether.

541
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,958
Grown men do not vanish
into thin air, mon ami.

542
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:32,749
Well, he did.

543
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,416
No!

544
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,624
Oh, my God, Donovan!

545
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,874
M. Bailey!
M. Bailey!

546
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,833
I'd better call an ambulance,
sir, I think.

547
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,624
Is he badly hurt?

548
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:13,833
Oh, my God.

549
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,374
That front axle's just sheered
right through.

550
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,791
Oh, mon pauvre Hastings.

551
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,416
But you must not brood.

552
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,749
You must occupy yourself, eh?

553
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,624
Go and telephone
the Chief Inspector Japp

554
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,374
and tell him we have caught
his fish, eh?

555
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:54,666
What's happened to Donovan?

556
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:58,583
It'll need
a whole new front end.

557
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,124
M. Bailey, please give me
the letter you have just taken

558
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,291
from the table.

559
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:32,208
Thank you, monsieur.

560
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,874
Jimmy, be so kind

561
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,041
as to read us this letter
written to Mrs. Grant.

562
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,333
Well, it looks as if it comes
from a solicitor's.

563
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,583
"Dear Madam, we return the
document you forwarded to us.

564
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:54,583
It is quite in order,

565
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,833
and the fact of the marriage
having taken place abroad

566
00:41:58,084 --> 00:41:59,999
does not invalidate it
in any way.

567
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,958
Yours truly,"
et cetera, et cetera.

568
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,208
So, Jimmy,
you ask why Mrs. Grant, huh?

569
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,374
Et bien -- voilà.

570
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:16,208
The marriage certificate

571
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:20,458
between Donovan Grant and
Ernestine Trapshaw, dated 1930.

572
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,333
Who's Donovan Grant?

573
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:32,249
He now calls himself
Donovan Bailey.

574
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,083
I wanted a divorce.

575
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,208
I begged Ernestine,

576
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,041
but she refused,

577
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,333
said she'd never let me free.

578
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,958
After I fell in love with Pat,
Ernestine started hounding me,

579
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:54,416
telephoned me every day,
held it over me,

580
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,208
threatening to tell Pat
everything.

581
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:02,708
Drove me mad.

582
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,208
And she suddenly announced
she'd taken a flat here,

583
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,666
right underneath Pat's.

584
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,916
I couldn't believe it.

585
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:18,458
By then, I knew she was
crazy enough to do anything.

586
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:23,833
So, what happened yesterday,
monsieur?

587
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:30,166
Ernestine called me
in the afternoon...

588
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,249
...said she'd written to Pat

589
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,999
to arrange to see her
to tell her the truth about us.

590
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,041
Well, I naturally assumed
the worst.

591
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,083
I knew I had to do something
once and for all.

592
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,708
I called around to her flat
around about 6:00.

593
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,083
Oh, it's you.

594
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:56,166
You'd better come in.

595
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,916
Drink?

596
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:14,333
You've absolutely no right
to go hounding Pat.

597
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,916
But I'm not hounding her,
my darling.

598
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:20,458
I'm simply telling her
what a rotten bounder you are,

599
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,749
promising to marry her when
you're already married to me.

600
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,166
We got married in Switzerland,
Ernestine, if you remember.

601
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,124
It doesn't count
under British law.

602
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,124
So you keep telling me.

603
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,416
But I thought I'd test
your little theory,

604
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:40,166
so I sent my solicitor a copy
of our marriage certificate.

605
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:43,624
He's telephoned me to say
it's completely valid.

606
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,499
And he's written back to me
to confirm it.

607
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,249
Show me.

608
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,249
I haven't received
his letter yet.

609
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,916
It'll arrive in the evening
post, I expect.

610
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:58,833
It's going to be quite a shock
for poor Miss Matthews.

611
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,958
I'm warning you, Ernestine,

612
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:03,458
if you approach Pat,
so help me God, I'll kill you.

613
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:04,624
I swear it.

614
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,499
Oh, Donovan.

615
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,791
Don't make me laugh.

616
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,458
Now, run along and try and
impress somebody else, will you?

617
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:18,624
Poor Miss Matthews.

618
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,874
You really have let her down,
Donovan.

619
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:47,416
I warned her, you see.

620
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:51,458
But she wouldn't listen.

621
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:58,333
Afterwards, I went back home
and changed for the theater.

622
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:06,041
I couldn't let her hurt Pat
like that, could I?

623
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,208
Ah, my dear Chief Inspector.

624
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:15,208
I came as fast as I could,
Poirot.

625
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:17,833
No, no, my friend,
you came just in time.

626
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:20,999
The case is closed.

627
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,708
Jimmy, go to Mlle. Patricia.

628
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,666
She doesn't want me.

629
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,416
She wants him.

630
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,874
No, no, no, no, no, mon ami.
She needs you.

631
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:09,958
Go on.
Go to her.

632
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,499
Hanging's too good
for some people.

633
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,833
Basically, what you've got here,
Hastings,

634
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:37,041
is some very expensive
scrap metal.

635
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:42,249
Hastings, my friend, Poirot
is as magnanimous in defeat

636
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,499
as he is modest in victory.

637
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,416
Ah, yes?

638
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:48,791
In view of the fact

639
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:51,833
that you are going to need
every penny you can get

640
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:55,416
to restore this beautiful
machine to health,

641
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,291
I have decided to pay up...

642
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,041
...and be content.

643
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:05,666
I say.

644
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,541
Thanks, old boy.

645
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,333
Think nothing of it... old boy.

646
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,916
Good morning, Miss Lemon.

647
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,708
Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

648
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,374
And what a beautiful morning
it is.

649
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,499
Lovely.

650
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,833
I hear you've been having
all sorts of excitement here.

651
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,583
No, it was nothing --
a case like any other.

652
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,916
I got your friar's balsam
for you.

653
00:48:57,709 --> 00:48:58,666
My what?

654
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,499
Your inhalant for your cold.

655
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,791
Poirot does not have colds,
Miss Lemon.

656
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:03,833
It is well known

657
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:06,541
that Poirot scorns all
but the gravest afflictions.

658
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,249
But yesterday you were --

659
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,124
Miss Lemon,
yesterday was yesterday.

660
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,874
My tisane, if you please.
