1
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,791
There's very little
I can do for him now, Mrs. Hill.

2
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:53,874
He's very weak.

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,249
Oh, dear.

4
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,208
Is there no hope?

5
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,916
I'm afraid not.

6
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,791
It's more a matter of hours
rather than days now.

7
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,458
Doesn't Mr. Anthony have
any relatives?

8
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,333
Just a brother -- Henry -- but
they haven't spoken in 20 years.

9
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:10,999
No one else?

10
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,124
Well, yes, there's Mr. George,
his nephew in London.

11
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,249
I expect he'd want to know.

12
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,708
First reaching for his hatchet,

13
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,999
which he's got near him,
close by,

14
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,624
the noble fireman
goes to fight --

15
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,541
No, no, hold on.
Maestro, please.

16
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,249
Have you ever been a fireman?

17
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,458
No, but I've sat next to one.

18
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:38,083
And what's this "Jolly Laughing
Cobbler Song" all about?

19
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,166
It's all about this cobbler
who's always...

20
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,374
Sorry to drag you away, George,
but there's a call for you.

21
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,999
Can't you take a message?

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,999
It's your uncle, old son.

23
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,083
I'm afraid he's in a bad way.

24
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,458
I see.

25
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,958
Thanks, Harry.
I'll come right away.

26
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,958
You see, sir, when I'm singing
this song, I'll be cobbling,

27
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,916
and I'll have a boot.

28
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,374
Oh, you'll get a boot,
all right.

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,666
It was the doctor himself
said I should call.

30
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,374
He's very bad, Mr. Lorrimer.

31
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,499
And I'm very grateful,
Mrs. Hill.

32
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,083
This is very distressing.

33
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,749
But I can't travel to Brighton
before Sunday, at the earliest.

34
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:24,874
He's at his last breath,
Mr. Lorrimer.

35
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,833
Sunday might be too late.

36
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,249
Oh, Lord, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,249
There really is
nothing I can do.

38
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,083
Well, what about
Mr. Henry Gascoigne, sir?

39
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,541
Do you think
I should try to reach him?

40
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,583
Uncle Henry?

41
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,791
Good God, no.
He'd welcome the news.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,416
No, when the time comes,
I'll break it to him myself.

43
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,083
As you say, Mr. Lorrimer.

44
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,041
Till Sunday, then.

45
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,833
Goodbye.

46
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,666
Goodbye, Mrs. Hill.

47
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,916
Oh, dear.

48
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,833
And following Hendren's defeat

49
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,874
in the first Test
at Trent Bridge,

50
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,458
the selectors made two changes.

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,166
R.E.S. Wyatt returned to
captain's side,

52
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,749
and Bill Bowes
was preferred to Mitchell.

53
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:24,833
Cricket -- the English enigma.

54
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,124
I know not of any other game

55
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,624
where even the players
are unsure of the rules.

56
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,333
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

57
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,041
Aussies are one up already.

58
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,249
You can bet "The Don" will be
looking for three figures

59
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:39,416
at the hallowed ground.

60
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,624
Hastings, I have no time
for this Don

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,958
and his crusade
at the hallowed ground.

62
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,458
I have a dinner engagement
with my dentist.

63
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:47,833
Your dentist?

64
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,416
Positively morbid.

65
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,458
But you're always
trying to avoid him.

66
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:52,624
Not at all.

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,624
Off duty, he's quite charming.

68
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,541
Besides, he likes to see
the end product at work.

69
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,833
For England, Bowes and Farnes

70
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,083
will return to excellent
figures, with 5 for 102...

71
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,833
You won't get any of your fancy
French kickshaws here,

72
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,958
I'm afraid, Poirot,

73
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,458
just good,
well-cooked English fare.

74
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,583
And I could ask for nothing
more, Bonnington, my friend.

75
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,416
That's why I place myself
in your hands, unreservedly.

76
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,958
-Yes?
-Absolutement.

77
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,541
Yes, well --
Now, where's Molly?

78
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,958
Good evening, sir.

79
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,333
Ah, Molly.

80
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,166
Now, what speciality have you
for us this evening?

81
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,291
You're in luck today,
Mr. Bonnington.

82
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,583
There's your favorite --

83
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,624
roast turkey
with chestnut stuffing

84
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,291
and fillet of sole to start.

85
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh, excellent.

86
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:03,833
For both of us.

87
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,916
Now, here is a girl who knows
exactly what I like, Poirot.

88
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,374
Well, I ought to know by now,
sir, I'm sure.

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,624
Do people always have
the same thing?

90
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,083
Mostly, sir, though
I'll you something odd.

91
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,083
You see old Mr. Gascoigne
sitting on his own over there?

92
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,624
I'd say he's been eating here

93
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,541
since the old queen died.

94
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,624
Henry Gascoigne --
painter of some sort, I'm told.

95
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,791
Well, he's at that table every
Wednesday and Saturday evening,

96
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,458
never misses, except last week,
he arrived on Monday.

97
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,749
Give me quite a turn.

98
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,749
Interesting deviation
from habit.

99
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,166
I wonder what the reason was.

100
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,958
Well, I reckon he must have
forgotten himself.

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,624
You know, he can't bear
suet puddings or blackberries,

102
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,541
and I've never known him take
thick soup.

103
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,499
Yet last Monday,
do you know what he ordered?

104
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,208
Thick tomato soup,
steak and kidney pudding,

105
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,291
and washed it all down
with a blackberry crumble.

106
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,666
Ah, mon Dieu.

107
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,499
And he was back again
on Wednesday, as usual,

108
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,666
his old self again.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,416
Anyway, I mustn't stand here,
gossiping.

110
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,458
She's a good girl, that.

111
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,916
And she knows a thing or two
about food.

112
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,833
You know, I find that
extraordinarily interesting.

113
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,124
What?

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,833
That old man's deviation
from habit.

115
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,833
Oh, the change in diet,
you mean.

116
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,416
Well, doctor's orders, I'd say.

117
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,958
It's common enough.

118
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:26,999
I think not,

119
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,916
unless, of course,
he thinks the old man

120
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,333
would benefit from indigestion.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,999
To my good friend,
Hercule Poirot,

122
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,666
for whom life without mystery

123
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,749
would be like roast beef
without the mustard.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,874
C'est la vérité, mon ami.

125
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,791
Ah.

126
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:51,624
I see that bicuspid
is still sensitive, Poirot.

127
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,083
We must take a look at that.

128
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,083
-Ah, no, no --
-It must be the heat.

129
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,166
What's that, Molly?

130
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,458
Old Mr. Gascoigne --
he's at it again --

131
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,124
steak-and-kidney pudding
and blackberry crumble.

132
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,166
Hello!

133
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,041
Hello?

134
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,749
What's all the noise?

135
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,624
It's this milk.

136
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,749
It's been out here
for three days.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,249
Dirty old devil.

138
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,249
Hasn't had a bath
since last Pancake Day, either.

139
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,166
Not a sound from inside.

140
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,166
He might have taken ill.

141
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:31,791
Oh, cold as ice.

142
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,291
Oh, poor love.

143
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,666
Must have taken a fall.

144
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,999
Here's a funny thing, Poirot.

145
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,749
Remember that old fellow we saw
at Bishop's the other night,

146
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,166
the one that Molly remarked on,
about how he'd changed his diet?

147
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,708
Ah, ah, try not to talk.

148
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:59,833
Well, I'm afraid he's eaten
his last blackberry crumble.

149
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:04,291
The poor old chap's
kicked the bucket.

150
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,999
It seems when he got home
that night,

151
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,708
he fell down the stairs
of his lodgings.

152
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,833
Yes, he's lived here
as long as anybody can remember.

153
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,916
Kept himself to himself.

154
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,124
You never spoke?

155
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,458
Well, we'd pass in the street
of an evening and say hello.

156
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,874
Except last week,
I might have been a ghost.

157
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,374
He walked right past me
and never said a word, he did.

158
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,166
Excuse me, madame.

159
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,416
Do you remember
which day last week?

160
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,916
Who are you, anyway,
asking all these questions?

161
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,291
Who's he?

162
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,999
He's not English, is he?
Begging your pardon.

163
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,416
He's Hercule Poirot,
private detective.

164
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,541
Madame.

165
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:51,249
Oh, yeah, well, they all
say that, don't they?

166
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,583
You tell him
it was last Saturday

167
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,291
that old Gascoigne passed me by
in the street.

168
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,916
That was the last time
I saw him alive.

169
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,791
Saturday!

170
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:02,999
Ah.

171
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,916
He was lying just here in
his dressing gown and slippers.

172
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,999
Shabby old thing, it was.

173
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,499
Wouldn't surprise me

174
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,499
if he didn't trip over the cord
or something.

175
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,124
Tripped over the cord.

176
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,624
Yes, thank you, madame.

177
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,333
And then you called the police?

178
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,708
Yes.

179
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,791
They just wrapped his body up
in a blanket and carried it out.

180
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,499
Didn't pay much attention
to anything else.

181
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:35,624
Poor old devil.

182
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,541
Did M. Gascoigne receive
many visitors, madame?

183
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,166
Only his model.

184
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,874
He was an artist, you see.

185
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,999
Ah.

186
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,749
She's up there now.

187
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,874
Thank you, Mme. Mullen.

188
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,833
Excusez-moi, mademoiselle?

189
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:08,874
Who are you?

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,583
I am Hercule Poirot,
a private investigator,

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,124
and my associate,
Captain Hastings.

192
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,499
Morning.

193
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,874
Is there something here
that requires an investigation?

194
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,541
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

195
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,083
It's more a matter
of professional curiosity.

196
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:25,458
That is all.

197
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,333
A small idea.

198
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,333
Perhaps you can help us,
mademoiselle.

199
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,958
Is there any reason
why I should?

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,708
Is there any reason
why you should not?

201
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,166
My name is Dulcie Lang.

202
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,458
I was Henry Gascoigne's model.

203
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,166
What else do you want from me?

204
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,583
I don't know,
but that is most helpful.

205
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,958
The bond between the artist
and his model is legendary.

206
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,124
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

207
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,041
But you would have noticed

208
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,708
if his behavior had been
in any way unusual.

209
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,124
I doubt it.

210
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,583
A painter's behavior
is always unusual.

211
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,666
They can never make up
their mind

212
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,083
whether to commit suicide
or give a party.

213
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,249
So, nothing out of the way
about him.

214
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,374
No, no worse than any of them.

215
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,333
He had some odd arrangement
with his agent, I believe --

216
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,499
Peter Makinson.

217
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,499
But you'd have to ask him
about that.

218
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,249
An agent?
So he was successful?

219
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,333
Oh, don't be misled by all this.

220
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,458
Henry wasn't a poor man,
just mean.

221
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,541
Did he have a family?

222
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,083
Well, there was a nephew that
he mentioned from time to time,

223
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,333
a music-hall man.

224
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,041
There was a brother, too,
somewhere or other.

225
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,291
Anthony -- yes, Anthony.

226
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,958
But there'd been a falling-out
between them.

227
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,416
He certainly never spoke
of the man like a brother.

228
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,791
Here.

229
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,041
Remarkable likeness.

230
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,833
They could have been twins.

231
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:49,833
Yes, two pins in a pot.

232
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,374
This small idea of yours --

233
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,583
what is it?

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,916
Oh, it's simply a notion.

235
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,916
I saw M. Gascoigne
on the evening of his death.

236
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,541
I was told that his behavior
had recently been,

237
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,249
uh -- How do you say? --
uncharacteristic.

238
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,666
But more than that,

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,083
the mantle of life should fit

240
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,624
like a well-tailored
suit of clothes, hmm?

241
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,791
But it did not hang so well on
that old man in the restaurant.

242
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,708
You see, mademoiselle,

243
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:35,499
I cannot accept that the fall
of M. Gascoigne was accidental.

244
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:44,374
Hardly the kind of woman to push
an old man to his death, Poirot.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,999
Ah, the auburn hair, mon ami,
always the auburn hair.

246
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,499
No, I just find it really hard
to believe. That's all.

247
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,874
Well, she did not seem to be
unduly upset

248
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:56,083
by M. Gascoigne's
untimely demise.

249
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,583
Well, why should she?

250
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,499
What about that brother --
Anthony?

251
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,916
Yes, we need to find
the brother,

252
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,249
but also the artist's agent,
Peter Makinson.

253
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,874
Thank you, driver.

254
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,833
This is where the future

255
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,541
of criminal investigation
lies --

256
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,999
our new forensic division,
the most advanced in the world.

257
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,708
It won't be long

258
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,999
before the likes of you and me
will be gone forever,

259
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:40,999
cast onto the scrap heap of life
like so much... scrap.

260
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,249
And you think
there is nothing to save us?

261
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,166
Not even all those little
gray cells of yours.

262
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,541
Gascoigne, H.

263
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:53,833
We'll all be extinct,
Poirot, dinosaurs.

264
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,458
Henry Gascoigne, 68 years
of age, artist by profession.

265
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,999
What's your interest in this,
Poirot?

266
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,833
Well, he was an acquaintance
of a friend of mine,

267
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,208
and I merely wish to put
his mind at rest.

268
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,999
Mm. Died from broken neck caused
by fall down the stairs.

269
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,374
Apparently, he was a recluse,
a bit of an eccentric.

270
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,208
None of the neighbors
can remember seeing any visitors

271
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,583
that evening
or the following morning.

272
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:20,749
That evening?

273
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,291
The estimated time of death

274
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,416
was at or around 9:30 p.m.
on Saturday, June the 16th.

275
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,499
Remarkable.

276
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,166
Your forensic division
is very precise, no?

277
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,208
Uh, well, no.

278
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,708
There was a letter in the old
boy's dressing-gown pocket.

279
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,874
It was posted that morning
in West 1

280
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,708
and arrived by the 9:30 delivery
that evening.

281
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,749
He must have gone down
to collect it

282
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,708
and fallen on his way back
upstairs.

283
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:45,749
I see.

284
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,124
May I see this letter?

285
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:53,458
The pathologists still got it,
with all Gascoigne's clothes.

286
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,166
Perhaps you remember
who might have sent it.

287
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,374
No, I don't.
It was harmless enough.

288
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,499
Of course.

289
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,874
Who was the pathologist,
did you say?

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,916
I didn't.

291
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,041
You take it from me, Poirot --
this case is closed.

292
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:13,416
Yes, well, let us hope,
Chief Inspector,

293
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,624
that the forensic sciences
of which you are so proud,

294
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,374
will not replace every aspect
of the detective's work.

295
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,666
Let us hope that camaraderie

296
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:27,249
will still play
a significant role, hmm?

297
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,999
His name is Cutter.

298
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,541
Hmm.

299
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,374
I'd better telephone him to make
sure he knows what to expect.

300
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,916
You see, Chief Inspector,

301
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:42,041
we are still very far
from being the species extinct.

302
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:45,083
Au revoir, mon ami.

303
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,833
Strong-looking fellow,
had years in him, I'd say --

304
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,041
still got his own teeth.

305
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:57,666
Gascoigne?

306
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,124
And the cause of death
was a broken neck?

307
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,874
Yes.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,458
Second and third vertebrae,
here and here.

309
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,083
You will also notice
extensive bruising

310
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,666
to the rib cage
and to the arms and legs,

311
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,624
consistent with a steep,
tumbling fall.

312
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,333
Down the stairs, yes.

313
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,666
Is it possible that M. Gascoigne

314
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,208
might have suffered
a seizure of the heart

315
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:25,999
or perhaps that of the brain?

316
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,916
No, he simply slipped and fell.

317
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,166
I see.

318
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,374
I believe
you were able to determine

319
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,416
the time of death
with some accuracy.

320
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:36,791
Mm.

321
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,166
It is never an easy task

322
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,249
to ascertain
the precise time of death.

323
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,999
Ah.

324
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,666
But this letter confirmed
your medical evidence, huh?

325
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:49,708
Yes.

326
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,083
Gascoigne had been seen
in a restaurant

327
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,249
at about 7:30 that evening.

328
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,291
Yes, I was there myself.

329
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,666
And this letter arrived
with the 9:30 evening post?

330
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:01,374
Yes.

331
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,166
An examination of the contents
of Gascoigne's stomach revealed

332
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,041
that he had eaten a light supper

333
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,958
two to three hours
before his death.

334
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,499
So it all fits together nicely,
no?

335
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,499
May I please borrow this letter,
monsieur?

336
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,624
Well, I'm sure
you can be entrusted

337
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,458
with its safekeeping,
Mr. Poirot.

338
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,083
Of course.

339
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,999
Are you sitting down, Hastings?

340
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,666
Yes. Yes, I am.

341
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,624
Very good.

342
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,416
I'm coming.

343
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:47,041
Oh, fine, fine.

344
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,583
Now...

345
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,499
Hastings, this is
a recipe of my mother --

346
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:55,833
rabbit...

347
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,041
cooked in the style of Liège.

348
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,166
Well, I bet it's better

349
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,874
than rabbit cooked
in the style of Hastings.

350
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:08,166
Yes, that is quite funny,
Hastings.

351
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,958
However, when you are grown up,

352
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,666
you will find that food

353
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:18,166
is not really the subject
suitable for the humor.

354
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:20,583
There.

355
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,999
Smells delicious.

356
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,208
Bon.

357
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:27,624
The aroma is the most important
ingredient in any dish.

358
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:30,833
No, no, no, Hastings.

359
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,666
Use your spoon.

360
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,208
That is the Liège way.

361
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,166
To use the knife
is an insult to the cook.

362
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:38,999
It implies the meat is tough.

363
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,374
Ah.

364
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,083
You're not eating?

365
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,458
Oh, unfortunately, no.

366
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:44,499
My left bicuspid

367
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,374
is still causing me
the considerable discomfort.

368
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,166
Ah.

369
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:55,458
Is it good, Hastings?

370
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,541
Please do not be stinting
with your praise.

371
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,749
Oh, it's wonderful.

372
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,374
Mm.

373
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,999
It tastes more, um --

374
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,458
well, rabbity than any rabbit
I've ever tasted.

375
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,583
That is the juniper berries.

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,874
Shall I give you
some more sauce?

377
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,749
No, no, no.
Not yet.

378
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,083
What was in that envelope they
found in old Gascoigne's pocket?

379
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:30,458
Ah.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,749
"You are invited to a preview of
contemporary European paintings

381
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,916
recently acquired
by the Farringdon Gallery."

382
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,124
Well, this may be both
informative and pleasurable,

383
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,458
Hastings.

384
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,833
And it's tomorrow.

385
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,374
Hmm.

386
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,249
"Man Throwing a Stone
at a Bird."

387
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,416
Really?

388
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,791
Which is which?

389
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,874
Joan Miró, Hastings, an exponent
of the surrealist vision.

390
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,749
A work inspired by the dream,
no?

391
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:23,666
Yes, a man with a most
individual imagination.

392
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,916
Is there some way
I can help you gentlemen?

393
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,083
My name is Makinson.

394
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,458
Peter Makinson?

395
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,208
The agent of Henry Gascoigne?

396
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,833
Yes.
What a tragic loss.

397
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:36,458
Ah.

398
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,874
I understand that your
contractual agreement

399
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,916
with Henry Gascoigne

400
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:41,374
was an unusual one, monsieur.

401
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,124
Unusual?

402
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,916
Have you ever heard of an artist
who wouldn't sell his paintings?

403
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,208
Wouldn't sell?
You mean not at all?

404
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,999
Well, that must have made
your work impossible.

405
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,124
Oh, I could sell
the smaller pieces --

406
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,666
the sketches and watercolors.

407
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,458
But the oils were never to fall

408
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,958
into the hands
of the Philistines --

409
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,708
his name for all collectors
and dealers.

410
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,791
So no one actually owns
a Gascoigne painting?

411
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,083
He made gifts of some --
gestures of friendship.

412
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,791
I have a small collection,

413
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,208
and Dulcie Lane, his model,
has several works.

414
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,333
But he was a man of few friends.

415
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:21,666
And now, of course,
after his death,

416
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,624
his paintings can be sold, hmm?

417
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,291
I imagine that would be so.

418
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,166
And you, monsieur --

419
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,958
you are free to sell
your own collection, yes?

420
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,333
Look, what is all this about?

421
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:35,999
You're not a collector, are you?

422
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,374
No, monsieur.

423
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,999
I am Hercule Poirot,
a private detective.

424
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,791
And I am investigating

425
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,624
the circumstances surrounding
the death of Henry Gascoigne.

426
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:53,999
I see.

427
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:00,916
Perhaps we'd better talk
about this in my office.

428
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,499
Gentlemen?

429
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,749
Thank you.

430
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,666
Ah, that is a picture
by M. Gascoigne, is it not?

431
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,166
But not his usual model.

432
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,499
No, that was painted years
before he met Dulcie Lang.

433
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:27,499
She is Charlotte Gascoigne,
a rare beauty.

434
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,333
Ah.

435
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:31,708
His wife?

436
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:35,583
No, Charlotte was married to
Anthony Gascoigne, his brother.

437
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,374
Ah.

438
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:42,916
There was, I understand,
some ill feeling between them.

439
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,208
Yes.

440
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,708
Henry arrived here one day
with this painting

441
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,166
and asked me to take it
into safekeeping.

442
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,333
For what reason?

443
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,249
I don't think brother Anthony

444
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,874
was keen on the idea
of his wife's naked body

445
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,083
being displayed in public.

446
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:07,124
You know,
the way I see it, Poirot,

447
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,666
everyone stands to benefit
from the old boy's death.

448
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,458
Indeed, mon ami.

449
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,416
His work was in demand,
but unobtainable.

450
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,874
His death will create
much attention.

451
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,916
Probably push the prices
through the roof.

452
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,291
Yes.

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,249
Whoever is fortunate enough
to own an original Gascoigne

454
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,333
can expect to feather
their nest,

455
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,333
including Makinson
and Mlle. Dulcie Lang.

456
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,583
Unbelievable.

457
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:34,624
No, no, no, mon ami.

458
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,833
Even the closest acquaintances
could be tempted.

459
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,541
Well, they could have
played for lunch.

460
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,583
Lunch?

461
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,541
England won the toss,
went in to bat.

462
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,541
Sutcliffe and Hammond were back
in the pavilion before lunch --

463
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,999
78 for 2 at the end
of the opening session.

464
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,916
Chipperfield trapped them both.

465
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:50,666
Lunch!

466
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,666
Of course, Hastings.
Lunch!

467
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,124
Don't you see?

468
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,458
See what, old man?

469
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:05,416
4 and 20 blackbirds
baked in a crumble.

470
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,416
I think you mean "pie,"
don't you?

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,249
"But that's what they have done
in all these cases.

472
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,958
An upstairs door
found screwed up,

473
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,749
when things were
at their height..."

474
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,458
-Miss Lemon?
-Mr. Poirot.

475
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:23,708
"...and jewels with him before
alarm could be raised."

476
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,624
-Raffles, Mr. Poirot.
-Ah.

477
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,666
"Not so old as it looks,"
said Raffles...

478
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,208
Such a dashing figure.

479
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,041
...choosing the cigars
and handing me mine.

480
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,249
Miss Lemon?

481
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:40,124
How did you get on
with the music halls?

482
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,249
George Lorrimer is the manager
of the Carlton Theater,

483
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,458
Bethnal Green.

484
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,374
Excellent work, Miss Lemon.

485
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:53,791
Miss Lemon, back to M. Raffles.

486
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,166
But Raffles only shook
his head.

487
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,666
"I don't believe
in that rope-ladder, Bunny,

488
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,041
except as a blind."

489
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,583
Hastings, tonight we must visit
the theater.

490
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,583
What's all this about
blackbirds, Poirot?

491
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,374
That Saturday evening,

492
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,499
Henry Gascoigne finished
his meal with a blackbird,

493
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,333
or, rather,
the blackberry crumble.

494
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,458
Now, the juice of the blackberry
leaves a dark stain,

495
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,791
and yet the teeth
of Henry Gascoigne

496
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:26,958
were not discolored.

497
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:28,874
I looked most particularly.

498
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,666
Oh, then, the waitress
must have been mistake.

499
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,916
It's easily done, you know.

500
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,124
According to the pathologist,

501
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:40,041
Henry Gascoigne died two hours
after eating a light meal.

502
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:42,124
Now, I do not consider soup,

503
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,041
followed by the steak and kidney
pudding, to be the light meal.

504
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,916
But suppose that meal
was not dinner, but lunch.

505
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,541
But the old boy was seen
at the restaurant at 7:30.

506
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,791
You saw him.

507
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,166
Yes.

508
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,541
But that was not
Henry Gascoigne.

509
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,249
That Saturday night, mon ami, I
dined not with Henry Gascoigne,

510
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:17,708
but with his murderer.

511
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,083
Henry Gascoigne
was already lying dead

512
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,416
at the foot of the stairs.

513
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,416
And the killer,
disguised as the old man,

514
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,333
was able to leave
the scene of the crime

515
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,624
without arousing suspicion.

516
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,499
Not quite.

517
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,958
He walked past the neighbor,
Mrs. Mullen,

518
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,124
without so much as a "good day."

519
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:40,124
But why take the old boy's place
at the restaurant?

520
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,874
To make it appear
that Gascoigne was still alive.

521
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,333
So, the question is, "Who could
imitate Henry Gascoigne?"

522
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,916
Mm-hmm.

523
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,374
I vote for the brother.

524
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,083
Well, Hastings,
it would certainly take

525
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,041
a long stretch
of the imagination

526
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,374
to see Miss Dulcie Lang in
the white wig and the whiskers.

527
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,541
Steady on, Poirot.

528
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:04,458
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

529
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,833
Next class, same time tomorrow.

530
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:12,749
Oh, Mr. Robinson, could I have
a word with you, please?

531
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,958
Ah, the detectives
with the small idea.

532
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:29,791
Please, mademoiselle,
forgive this intrusion.

533
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:34,124
Oh, not at all, gentlemen.

534
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:39,041
As you have already seen
for yourselves,

535
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,624
I have nothing to hide.

536
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,291
No, no, we were up
in the gallery.

537
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,374
Miss Lang, I am now
completely convinced

538
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,333
that the death
of Henry Gascoigne

539
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:53,208
was deliberately arranged

540
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,874
and by someone he knew well.

541
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,166
Am I a suspect?

542
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,958
I understand Henry Gascoigne
gave you a number of paintings.

543
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,416
Yes, four life studies.

544
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,958
So you are aware, no doubt,
of their value?

545
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,583
Yes, I've had
a number of generous offers.

546
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:10,458
Well, you could be
a wealthy woman, Miss Lang.

547
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,124
You think I'd part with them
at any price?

548
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,124
Miss Lang, one final question.

549
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:31,624
Henry Gascoigne's twin brother,
Anthony --

550
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,749
do you know
where he might be found?

551
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,499
No, I don't.

552
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,999
Perhaps you should ask
the nephew.

553
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,541
Ah, thank you, Miss Lang.

554
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,583
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

555
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,999
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce Mr. Tommy Pinner!

556
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,166
Well, who better to masquerade
as the old man

557
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,499
than his twin brother?

558
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,624
Yes, the idea seems
most attractive, mon ami.

559
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,166
I'll give you
just one more chance.

560
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,791
What else can you do?

561
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,916
Oh, I'll sing you songs!

562
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,291
It's called
"Dinah Come and Hold My Hand."

563
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,999
Dinah, come and hold your hand?

564
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,499
-Yes, sir.
-It sounds pathetic.

565
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,249
And when it's over,

566
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,333
Dinah comes out
and holds my hand!

567
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,041
-Does she?
-Yes, sir, and that's the end.

568
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,541
It certainly is.

569
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,249
It's awful, atrocious.

570
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,083
-Atrocious, sir?
-Yes.

571
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,749
Ohh.

572
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,583
And the fireman, sir?

573
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,624
Oh, that -- worse still.

574
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:03,541
Ohh, but, sir --

575
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:04,916
Well, what now?

576
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,749
Do you want a sword swallower?

577
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,333
Ohh!

578
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,374
Good house, bad house,
good house.

579
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,749
On the house.

580
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,458
They love you.

581
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:38,416
Yeah, we got time
for a quick one.

582
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:39,499
Yeah.

583
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,166
Come in.

584
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,874
M. George Lorrimer?

585
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,666
No, actually, I'm Harry Clarke,
George's assistant.

586
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:03,624
He's not here tonight.

587
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:05,499
Ah.

588
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,999
Can you tell me where I might
find him this evening, monsieur?

589
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,499
Well, I'm afraid not.

590
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,333
He's out of town, in Brighton,

591
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:14,624
attending to his uncle's
funeral arrangements.

592
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,916
In Brighton?

593
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,291
Yes, is there something wrong?

594
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,708
No, no.

595
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,208
C'est difficile, monsieur.

596
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,999
You see, we were led to believe

597
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,541
that Henry Gascoigne would not
be buried until next week

598
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:28,958
and, then, here in London.

599
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,166
Henry?

600
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,791
You've got the wrong chappie.

601
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:34,916
George was talking about his
Uncle Anthony -- died last week.

602
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,124
Anthony?

603
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,208
Yes.
The funeral's tomorrow.

604
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,083
We therefore commit his body
to the ground,

605
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,124
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

606
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,999
dust to dust.

607
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,458
A quiet affair,
is it not, Hastings?

608
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,374
With both the brothers dead,

609
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,166
there aren't many Gascoignes
left to pay their respects.

610
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:08,916
Not too many suspects left,
either, hein?

611
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:37,249
I'm Lorrimer, George Lorrimer,
Anthony's nephew.

612
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,791
Captain Hastings.

613
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,708
Hercule Poirot, monsieur.

614
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,374
Poirot?
The name is familiar.

615
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,124
Should I know you?

616
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,541
Oh, perhaps Henry Gascoigne

617
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,791
might have mentioned me
in passing.

618
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,874
Ah, you knew Uncle Henry.

619
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:55,624
I was an acquaintance,
but many years ago.

620
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,499
I only heard of the double
tragedy last evening,

621
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:04,624
and I felt the need to express
my condolences to Mrs. Gascoigne

622
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,374
and to yourself in person,
monsieur.

623
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,249
I'm sorry?
Mrs. Gascoigne?

624
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,291
Yes, the wife of Anthony.

625
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:14,791
Oh, you mean Mrs. Hill,
the housekeeper.

626
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:16,791
She looked after him for years.

627
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,541
Then Mme. Gascoigne...

628
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,249
Dead, yes.

629
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:21,708
10 years now.

630
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,958
Marked the beginning of the end
for old Anthony.

631
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:25,791
He became a virtual recluse.

632
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,958
But listen --
I'm being terribly impolite.

633
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,208
Why don't you both come back
to the house?

634
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:34,666
Oh, oh, there's no wake,
you understand.

635
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,208
But I'm sure Mrs. Hill

636
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,583
will provide us
with some refreshment.

637
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:41,249
An offer that is most generous,
monsieur.

638
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,124
We accept.

639
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,999
The least I can do.

640
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:46,708
Thank you.

641
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:50,666
Anyway, I'd like to hear
about you and Henry.

642
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:56,708
Henry's passion for painting

643
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,499
once lit the small fires
of my own imagination,

644
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,624
but, alas,
my talent as a painter

645
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,749
was not as great as my ambition.

646
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,624
May I be of some assistance,
Mrs. Hill?

647
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,999
I can manage very well,
thank you, sir.

648
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,916
Have a seat.

649
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:14,958
Thank you.

650
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:17,374
Mr. Hastings.

651
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,458
Merci.

652
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:29,583
And the two brothers?

653
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:32,708
They were twins?

654
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,499
Yes, not identical, but they
bore a great resemblance.

655
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,541
Ah.

656
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,458
And also they had together
the great rapport, no?

657
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,124
Rapport?
No, not at all.

658
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,208
They hadn't spoken in 20 years.

659
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,749
Sacré.

660
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,249
Well, what could have caused
such disharmony?

661
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,041
Well, years ago,
Charlotte was Henry's model.

662
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,916
But that's too light a word.

663
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,916
She was more his inspiration.

664
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,291
Ah -- the muse.

665
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:00,791
And then along came Anthony
and stole the girl's heart.

666
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,541
He whisked her away, leaving
his brother a broken man.

667
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,916
Ah.

668
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,958
And the wounds from such
a battle run deep.

669
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:12,833
Well, their differences
are well and truly buried now.

670
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,958
They both had a good innings.

671
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,624
Mm.

672
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:20,291
Up stumps
and back to the pavilion.

673
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,166
If you'll excuse the expression.

674
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,708
Oh, yes.

675
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,166
A most distressing time for you,
madame.

676
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,041
Nursemaid and companion, I was,

677
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,791
cook and cleaner
all those years.

678
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,916
And then he goes just like that,

679
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,999
not a thank-you
for all my trouble,

680
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,666
not a penny
by way of remembrance.

681
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,916
Not even a small legacy
in the will for your services?

682
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,666
There was no will.

683
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,333
Paper? Paper, sir?

684
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,416
Get your flags here.

685
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,333
I expect it all goes
to him, the next of kin.

686
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:19,916
His right, I suppose, though
he doesn't deserve any of it.

687
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:24,374
Wouldn't come to see his uncle
when he was at his last breath.

688
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,374
Thank you so much.

689
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,833
Flags!
Get your flags here!

690
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,624
Mrs. Hill,
could you please tell me --

691
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:51,958
exactly when did
M. Anthony Gascoigne pass away?

692
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,666
1:00 in the afternoon,
last Friday.

693
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:05,083
There was just me and him
at the end.

694
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,666
I told Mr. George --

695
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:10,791
Mr. Lorrimer, that is --
that there wasn't much time.

696
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:15,541
But it was the Sunday
before he arrived.

697
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,374
By tea on the second day, the
Aussies are 63, without loss,

698
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,249
chasing England's
first inning's total of 440.

699
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,541
Leyland made 109 and Ames 120.

700
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:32,833
You know, that's the first time
a keeper's made a century

701
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,041
in a Test.

702
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,458
I wonder if the weather
will hold there.

703
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,666
Hastings.
The crickets.

704
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:48,291
It occupies too many
of your little gray cells.

705
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,458
Mrs. Hill, thank you so much
for giving us of your time.

706
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:56,416
Would you like us now to walk
you back to the house?

707
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:57,583
No, thank you, sir.

708
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:01,874
I just want to sit and listen
to the band for a bit.

709
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,166
Well, that was quite a yarn
you were spinning back there,

710
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,333
old man -- the fires
of artistic endeavor?

711
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,374
I nearly blushed.

712
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,374
Ah, Hastings, you do not
understand the finer feelings.

713
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,541
But you were lying.

714
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,791
No, no, no, Hastings.

715
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,541
I did not want to cause
M. Lorrimer further grief

716
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:34,833
with the revelation that one of
his uncles had been murdered.

717
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,958
And by posing as an acquaintance
of Henry Gascoigne,

718
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,958
my inquiries appeared no more
than innocent curiosity.

719
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,124
Well, it certainly puts paid
to my theory, anyway.

720
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:49,791
Ah, yes, you expected more
from this brotherly intrigue.

721
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,624
Le crime passionnel, hein?

722
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,999
No, no, no, mon ami.

723
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:56,624
We have been running up
the wrong tree.

724
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,083
Twice every week,

725
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,749
Henry Gascoigne walked
from his house here

726
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,458
to the Bishop's Chophouse.

727
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,208
So he was a man of routine.

728
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,874
There would be no variation.

729
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,374
Now, that Saturday evening,

730
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:27,249
after the imposter had pushed
Henry Gascoigne to his death,

731
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,166
he would have followed
this route

732
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,499
as a matter of course.

733
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,624
Hastings, where of an evening

734
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,708
can a man be seen to enter
a place as one character

735
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,833
and emerge as another
completely different character?

736
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,333
Well, he could use
a boarding house or a hotel.

737
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,166
Without arousing
the slightest suspicion?

738
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,666
After the masquerade
at the restaurant,

739
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,749
he'd need to abandon
his disguise.

740
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,083
He would want to change back
into his own clothes in a hurry

741
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:00,624
and secure his alibi, hmm?

742
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,583
Discretion would be the problem.

743
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,041
I think I have seen the answer,
mon ami.

744
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,124
Well, if you're expecting a show
or something, governor,

745
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,249
you've come to the wrong shop.

746
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,458
I can assure you, monsieur,
that I am in the right shop.

747
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,083
Oh, don't you come the old acid
with me, squire.

748
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,874
I'm sorry -- "the old...?"

749
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,291
Or I'll make sure...

750
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,499
No, no, no, no, no,
I do not think so.

751
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:51,374
And if I mistake not,
that beret you are wearing

752
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,624
would suit better a man
of an artistic calling.

753
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:56,999
What's going here?

754
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:59,749
You are aware, are you not,
that the withholding of evidence

755
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,208
that might lead to the
conviction of a known criminal

756
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,874
is a most serious offense?

757
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,583
What evidence?

758
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,124
The yellow neckerchief worn by
a man wanted for questioning

759
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:12,458
in connection with the murder
of Henry Gascoigne.

760
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:16,124
There will also be the corduroy
jacket with the trousers,

761
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,124
a waistcoat with the berets,

762
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,583
and a cane in a dark wood.

763
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,583
All that was just lying there,
wasn't it?

764
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:27,791
I was gonna throw them out,

765
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,916
thought I'd make a few bob
with it down the line.

766
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:32,291
You have been diligent
and honest, sir.

767
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,041
I trust
that this will compensate

768
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:41,124
for the few bob
you might have made.

769
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:26,666
Well, Dulcie Lang was sitting
for a life class

770
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,291
from 1:00 until 5:00
on Saturday afternoon,

771
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,833
so we can eliminate her.

772
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,583
Oh, yes, Miss Lang is innocent.

773
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:35,249
He is running in now --

774
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,083
one, two, three, four,
and his arm goes over.

775
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:43,083
Oh, Darling staggers back
with his right foot.

776
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,583
Makinson, too, I'm afraid.

777
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:45,624
He was in Paris.

778
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,666
That brings us back
to square one.

779
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,166
No, no, mon ami, far from it.

780
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,874
We are about to make
our final move.

781
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,624
Kindly ask Miss Lemon to get me
the Chief Inspector Japp

782
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,666
on the telephone.

783
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,333
He's hit the ball this time.

784
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:01,291
Oh, Darling -- it's good.

785
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:04,208
The ball's in the air,
and Sutcliffe's taken it.

786
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,291
Simple catch,
and Darling is out for naught.

787
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,583
That's Verity's third wicket
of the morning.

788
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,791
Australia now 204 for 4.

789
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:24,999
Afternoon, Freddie.

790
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:26,624
Hello, sir.

791
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:44,791
Ah, M. Lorrimer, I'm so glad.

792
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,166
Please to come up here.

793
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,874
Poirot? What's going on?

794
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,708
Who are your friends?

795
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,749
Captain Hastings
of course you know.

796
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,416
And this is Chief Inspector Japp
from Scotland Yard.

797
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,541
We have reason to believe,
Mr. Lorrimer,

798
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,791
that your uncle's death
was not an accident.

799
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:05,166
Not an accident?

800
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:07,124
Please.

801
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:12,458
This clothing was part of
the assassin's disguise.

802
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,958
It was discarded close to
the Bishop's Chophouse

803
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:20,374
after he had masqueraded as
your uncle following the murder.

804
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,291
These strands of white hair are
from the wig, sir.

805
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,791
The darker hairs
would be the guilty party's.

806
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,333
They should be an easy match.

807
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:28,374
Wigs?

808
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,749
Masquerade?

809
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:33,333
Yes, a devious finale to
a most sinister plot, monsieur.

810
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,958
You see, that Saturday evening,

811
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,874
after he had pushed
Henry Gascoigne to his death,

812
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:42,874
the assassin searched through
the correspondence on his desk.

813
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,499
He retrieved this envelope,

814
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,791
which he had sent
the day before.

815
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,624
Now, what could be more innocent

816
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,041
than an invitation
to an art gallery, eh?

817
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,041
However, he had one last
artistic task to perform.

818
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,999
But he was not
a skilled craftsman.

819
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,208
Regarde.

820
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:12,416
He changed the postmark
from the 15th to the 16th...

821
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:17,749
...and smudged the mark
on the blotter

822
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,624
to further conceal the forgery.

823
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,291
He placed the envelope in your
uncle's dressing-gown pocket,

824
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,124
and then,
disguised as the old man,

825
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,791
he took his place
at the Bishop's Chophouse.

826
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,624
And so it appeared
that Henry Gascoigne

827
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:35,166
had fallen to his death that
Saturday evening -- oh, yes --

828
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:37,541
but after the 9:30 post
had been delivered.

829
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:38,624
Whoever could do such a thing?

830
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,416
Oh, well, at first I suspected
his colleagues,

831
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:44,124
but they all had
the solid alibis.

832
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:47,333
And then naturally I turned
my attention towards his family.

833
00:47:47,459 --> 00:47:48,791
But Anthony was dead.

834
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,833
It appeared that you were
the only living relative,

835
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:53,624
and of course you were.

836
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:58,583
And where were you when your
uncle was murdered, monsieur?

837
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,249
Where was I?

838
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:04,916
Well, I-I'd have been here
at the theater

839
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:06,458
for the second performance.

840
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:07,499
Of course.

841
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,916
Ah, yes, but that would have
been a Saturday evening,

842
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:09,958
Mr. Lorrimer.

843
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,958
Neither the staff
nor the artists here

844
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:14,458
can remember seeing you
on that Saturday afternoon.

845
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:15,499
At which time, I would say,

846
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,583
you were attending
to some business, yes?

847
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:18,124
Yes.

848
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:21,083
The murder of your uncle.

849
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,249
You think I killed Henry?

850
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,374
Well, this is madness.

851
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,416
I had no quarrel with him.

852
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:32,249
After Anthony's death,

853
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,499
Henry was the only living
relative to stand between you

854
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,666
and the Gascoigne estate.

855
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,083
This is a lie!
A damned lie!

856
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,374
Ah.

857
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:46,041
We have acquired
a sample of typeface

858
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,541
from the typewriter
in your office, monsieur.

859
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,166
I am certain that it will be
the perfect match

860
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,833
with the address
on the envelope --

861
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,708
the signature of the murderer.

862
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,499
So, it was the musical act
that made you suspect Lorrimer.

863
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:32,291
Well, it was a very good
impression of an old man,

864
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,166
and Lorrimer must have seen it
many times.

865
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,249
Indeed.

866
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,666
And Lorrimer had been ready
for many weeks.

867
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:39,708
When Mrs. Hill, the housekeeper,

868
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:42,624
telephoned with word
of Anthony's imminent death,

869
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,124
Lorrimer knew
that all of Anthony's money

870
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,249
will go to Henry Gascoigne
because there was no will.

871
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:52,666
But why on earth would Lorrimer
masquerade as old Gascoigne

872
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:54,416
on the previous Monday night?

873
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:55,458
Dress rehearsal --

874
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:57,624
had to be sure of the disguise
on the night.

875
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,999
He nearly got away with it.

876
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,791
Yes, but you cannot play Othello

877
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,541
simply by blacking your face,
eh?

878
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,999
You have to think
like a Moorish general.

879
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:10,708
Lorrimer's performance
was fatally flawed.

880
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,708
Hastings,
suddenly you look very pale.

881
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:17,249
Are you feeling unwell?

882
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,083
The Test, Poirot.
Extraordinary!

883
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,333
Listen -- "Verity takes
14 wickets for 70 runs

884
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:28,583
on a day when England bowled out
Australia twice

885
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,124
to win the second Test."

886
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,583
Six wickets in the last hour.

887
00:50:34,584 --> 00:50:37,791
And after the weekend rains,
you are surprised, mon ami?

888
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,958
Australians are used to
hard pitches.

889
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:43,374
The Lord's wickets would have
been decidedly sticky, no?

890
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,583
So it's not a day
for the stroke play.

891
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,833
No, it's a day
for the art of spin bowling.

892
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,499
And Hedley Verity is
the greatest exponent alive,

893
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:55,124
bowling left arm, the leg
breakers to the right-handers.

894
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,374
He would have them marching

895
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,249
through the long room
in no time, eh?

896
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,624
He has flight variation,
the chinaman,

897
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:04,333
and the most deadly quick of all
that dips into a Yorker.

898
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:05,499
Oh, yes.

899
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,874
On such a day,
M. Verity would consider,

900
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:10,958
what, 14 for 70, a fair hole.
