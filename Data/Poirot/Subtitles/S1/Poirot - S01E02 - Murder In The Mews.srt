1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,670
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes.

2
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,350
Hastings, my expensive one, says to me.

3
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,430
To destroy the English Parliament,
was it a crime or a noble act?

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,030
It is not worthwhile to ask about me.
I never realized a lot of of politics.

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,390
Where you are. Japp?

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,390
It does not support fireworks.

7
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,750
The noise injures the sensibility
of many ladies.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,390
Perhaps, perhaps.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,550
It seems to me that the fact is that she does not like
of seeing the persons enjoying oneself.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,110
He would say that it is a beautiful night
to commit a crime.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,270
If someone wanted to kill someone,
a shot was not heard by the fire.

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,310
It is already not possible to say the same thing
if the option was the estrangulamento.

13
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,150
No. In fact, no.

14
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,310
- Or poisoning, already now.
- Yes.

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,710
Be getting involved with me!

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,790
It is true, Hastings.
We am alone putting us with you.

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,990
I keep on thinking that it is
a beautiful night to commit a crime.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,540
I am going to leave them here.
It is here that I stay.

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,950
In the good-night, Inspector Chief.
In the good-night, Poirot.

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,030
- In the good-night.
- Up to tomorrow.

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,110
Good night!

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,670
Continue, boys.

23
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,670
It is not going to forget
of his consultation in the dentist to 11:00?

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,030
Hercule Poirot
it does not need to go to a dentist.

25
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,710
It postponed already once.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,070
My teeth are completed.
It is a sacrilege to adulterate them!

27
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,990
Because we do not do anything of constructive one
for my collars, Mrs. D. Lemon?

28
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,470
That laundry must be
on account of my enemies...

29
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,510
- Residence of the Mr. Poirot.
- You. Poirot, please.

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,460
Yes.

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,910
Inspector-chief Japp.

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,380
He is here.

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,220
- Good-day, Inspector-chief Japp...
- This is strange, Poirot.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,590
One remembers of we stop
in the Stables Garden last night

35
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,910
where his friend Hastings
it guards the automobile

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,150
and to say that the noise of the fire
was it stifling a shot?

37
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,630
- Yes.
- So someone fired.

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,070
- To serious?
- It is not a murder, it seems a suicide.

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,270
But the case is not very clear...

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,390
I will be in there of an hour.

41
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,870
Cancel all my promises
for this morning, Beauty queen Lemon.

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,550
But...

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,350
- I thank to have come, Poirot.
- Of all.

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,590
I wait for them to myself what values while having
when an urgent promise was canceled.

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,350
- Had you had to?
- Do not doubt.

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,670
The dead woman is called a Mrs. Allen.
It was sharing the house with a friend,

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,390
Beauty queen Plenderleith,
photographer or something of the type.

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,670
The Beauty queen Plenderleith
it was out in the field,

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,580
and when it returned this morning
it found the shut door.

50
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,220
Rice seed, but it does not obtain answer.

51
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,110
Be preoccupied and it calls the police officer.

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,390
To 10:45,
our colleagues break the door down

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,390
and they find you. AIIen in the ground,
with a shot in the cabeca.
Ç

54
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,390
- Then, Brett, what the problem is?
- The position is normal.

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,980
If she was giving a shot in the head,
it had to slip for this position.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,550
- But ...?
- The problem they are the impressions.

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,720
A thing to that of light one
of the thumb and of the index finger.

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,310
The same thing that would be obtained while trying
to put the weapon in her hand, and badly.

59
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,350
It arms in the left hand,
injured in the left side...

60
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,430
It had to be left-handed.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,910
It seems that it is holding the weapon,

62
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,030
but it is only with her in the hand.

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,430
- More something?
- The window was closed and locked.

64
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,190
The door was locked,
but we did not find the key.

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,860
What is this?

66
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,110
It can mean something.

67
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,270
- Does anything take place to him?
- It was looking at the clock.

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,870
It seems that be expensive.

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,630
" It mixes, 5 of November ".

70
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,910
- Is there how much time is killed?
- It died around the 23.30 of yesterday.

71
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,150
- There is no sign of a written note.
- No.

72
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,550
It seems to me that completely what we have
it is the lost key...

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,830
If we had the key,
we would not hesitate.

74
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,190
We would say that it was a suicide.

75
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,750
It is necessary to have been a terrible shock,
Beauty queen Plenderleith.

76
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,590
I still do not manage to believe.

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,780
We are going to try to be abbreviations.

78
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,670
It counted already to an Inspector Jameson
since it found the body this morning.

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,350
Was it out in weekend?

80
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,270
- Yes. From Friday in the afternoon.
- Excuse, my lady.

81
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,950
When it found the shut door,
it called the police officer.

82
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,740
His friend did not take place to him what
could it have gone out and closed the door?

83
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,750
Is it why because it would do it?

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,870
Be that as it may,
a note would have left me.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,590
- And did not it leave any?
- Clear what not!

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,710
Talk to me on you. Allen.

87
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,710
I knew it abroad.
She was returning of the Indian.

88
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,470
He wanted someone to share the seat
and we sympathized one with other one.

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,910
And the husband?

90
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,670
Not noteworthy at all, apparently.

91
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,030
It was drinking, I find. It died one year
or two after marrying.

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,230
If you know. Allen
did it have financial problems?

93
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,190
No, I am sure that not.

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,950
It had some friend or friends
closer men?

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,830
It was that he gets engaged to return marrying,
if that responds to his question.

96
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,990
What the name of the man is
with whom does it link was he going to marry?

97
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,510
- My God, the Charles did not say to.
- The one who is it Chatter?

98
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,830
The fiance, Charles Loverton-West.

99
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,580
It is delegated of the government in Hampshire.
It must to him have phoned.

100
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,350
We are going to speak with him.
Did not he know them to me about any anger?

101
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,910
It would be very much surprised.
To Pipe it was not given to discussions.

102
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,750
What his opinion is
on you. Laverton-West?

103
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,470
It is young, ambitious,
speak well in public, it is made a list well.

104
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,590
And in another side of the balance?

105
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,070
- Not much banal ... and quite pompous.
- They are not very big defects.

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,700
- Does not it find?
- Perhaps for you.

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,550
But for you. Allen, no.

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,470
She would not notice them.

109
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,950
- Was it liking his friend?
- Yes. Very much.

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,190
I know that this must be annoyed,
I me need to ask more two questions.

111
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,990
- You. was Allen left-handed?
- Left-handed? No, I think that not.

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,550
- No. I am sure that not.
- To serious?

113
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,630
The fact is that the shot was in the left temple
and the weapon was in the left hand.

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,790
- Did not it notice when he saw the body?
- No.

115
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,630
I ... it was so awful
what I did not repair in anything.

116
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,070
We understand.
But it is highly unlikely

117
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,270
what a skilful person
it was firing with the left hand.

118
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,990
- Sometime did he see this?
- No.

119
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,190
It is not his not even of the Mrs. Allen?

120
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,940
- A woman does not use these things.
- Then does it recognize it?

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,150
I do not recognize it.
I recognize them to myself what is.

122
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,400
It is a half
of a button of man's fist.

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,550
This filter is spoilt.

124
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,430
We put a new and he is going to work
like a clock certinho.

125
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,270
Hastings!

126
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,950
Hello!

127
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,950
- What it is doing, Hastings?
- A few arrangements in the car.

128
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,430
You had to be asking questions.
Probing the local opinion.

129
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,630
- Oh, already I did that!
- Freddie!

130
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,070
Freddie is helping me
with the filter of the oil.

131
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,230
This is going to maintain it held tight
up to having the piece of news anilha.

132
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,390
- Right. This is you. Poirot.
- How it is, boss?

133
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,020
I am Fred Hogg.

134
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,430
- Hello, Freddie.
- Freddie has the news.

135
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,590
- Did you see anything last night?
- You. Allen went to the mail to the six.

136
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,990
But there to 21:30, a car appeared...
A Standard Swallow.

137
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,550
It swims of special one,
but it was looking good.

138
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,670
A man left, there of approximately 45...
quite established, soldier's aspect.

139
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,590
- Had you already seen it?
- Yes, sometimes.

140
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,910
Dark overcoat, moustache to the little brush.
It was there more or one less hour.

141
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,910
- I saw them leaving joined.
- Then did you see it?

142
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,430
It me does not escape very much, boss.

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,830
- You heard what they said, clearly.
- Yes.

144
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,520
He said
" Think well and then he speaks with me ".

145
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,750
Then she said any thing
and he said " Up to abbreviation ".

146
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,070
And speaking, did they seem friendly?

147
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,910
One never knows with fine people,
I am them that yes.

148
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,030
You did not hear what you said. Allen?

149
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,540
No, she was average behind the door.

150
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,870
Now he hears, boy, I want that you answer
with much taken care to this question.

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,470
If you will not know the answer
or not to remind of you, he says. Combined?

152
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,800
- Ask the question.
- Did which you erase close the door?

153
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,430
I think that it went to lady.
No, link not! It was he!

154
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,270
He opened it a bit with strength
and it got involved in the car quickly.

155
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,750
It prays well. It seems to you to be a good informer.
Here you have six pence.

156
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,430
Very much thank you, man.
And does it manage to stretch them up to 1 shilling?

157
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,510
Go, go away!

158
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,070
- Inspector Chefe Japp and Mr. Poirot.
- Good morning. What I owe this pleasure?

159
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,230
- It is not any pleasure, unfortunately.
- To serious?

160
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,470
- We bring bad news.
- Continue.

161
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,710
It is on you. Allen.
You. Barbara Allen.

162
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,950
What is that it goes on?
Say, man!

163
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,750
It died, man.

164
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,190
Did it die?

165
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,310
I do not believe. What happened?

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,350
Apparently, it was a suicide.
Does he know if something was preoccupying it?

167
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,830
No, not even for shadows.
We were going away to marry.

168
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,070
We knew already.

169
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,710
I do not believe. Killed?

170
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,550
How?

171
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,550
With a shot.

172
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,950
With a shot? Good Lord!
Will it be that the newspapers know already of this?

173
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,190
I cannot say to him.
It will be that I can ask about him...

174
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,950
Is it? Obliged...
Yes, I wait.

175
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,670
He is the Prime minister.

176
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,430
I have some questions what...

177
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,630
Yes, make one's mark with my secretary.
Yes, yes, I am.

178
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,030
Very well, man. We will do that.
I lament to have brought so bad news.

179
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,710
Allow to me what it expresses
my condolences.

180
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,390
Yes. Thank you.
Be necessary to maintain the composure, he knows already.

181
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,270
Magnify!

182
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,670
Already now ... you. was Allen left-handed?

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,870
Left-handed? No, it does not look to me.

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,230
I cannot say what ... no.
She was skilful, I am sure.

185
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,750
Mr. Prime minister...
Of all, Mr. Prime minister.

186
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,630
Yes, yes, it is completely ready.

187
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,030
What a peacock! No, a peacock not.
A known fox.

188
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,460
It is how he says, Japp. More preoccupied
with the newspapers what with the fiancee.

189
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,990
It is the Plenderleith that was certain.

190
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,390
Even so, well similar.
It must be pleasing to some women.

191
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,710
Perhaps.

192
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,790
I find them to myself what would not see this
with sense of mood.

193
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,500
What it matters the fact is that they all agree
what you. Allen was skilful.

194
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,920
Yes. We do not owe them to me
to draw hasty conclusions.

195
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,900
Do not be preoccupied by that.
We are talking about a murder.

196
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,310
For the Laundry Bulldog Breed.

197
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,180
Expensive Sirs,

198
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,020
Again

199
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,750
I am obliged

200
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,860
communicating them

201
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,750
my dissatisfaction

202
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,270
in spite of pressing of
my collars.

203
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,350
I refer to my educations

204
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,540
of 2 of March of 1935

205
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,790
and subsequent letters of...

206
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,670
Look for them and enumerate them.

207
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,380
- All, Mr. Poirot?
- All, Beauty queen Lemon.

208
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,710
The subject is becoming serious.

209
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,950
The problem, Mr. Poirot,
the fact is that they do not realize the letters.

210
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,870
- For what not?
- They are Chinese, Mr. Poirot.

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,870
- Is the laundry a Chinese?
- It is, Mr. Poirot.

212
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,510
- Is it where that the world is going to stop?
- I do not do idea.

213
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,790
But when the boy brings the clothes,
it brings the letters in order that I explain them to him.

214
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,470
- And does it explain him?
- No.

215
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,750
- Why?
- I do not speak Chinese.

216
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,830
- Then what he says to him?
- Well, I say to him...

217
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,230
" Collar erases badly pressed ".
I catch the collars and show him.

218
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,150
You spent a few times in China,
was not he Hastings?

219
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,740
It is true. Excellent types.

220
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,820
Did it have any problem with the laundry?

221
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,510
- By chance, I had.
- And what he said to them?

222
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,630
Well ... he said...
" collar erases badly pressed ".

223
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,820
Exactamente. I knew that the Captain
it had been in the Orient and I asked.

224
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,110
- But the collars did not improve!
- Thinking well ... mine also not.

225
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,110
Because it does not arrange other collars?
Of what they are in use more.

226
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,670
Of what they are in use? Billet what Poirot
does it use any thing?

227
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,150
- He is not that, Poirot...
- A common collar

228
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,840
it is the first symptom
of decadence of the grey mass.

229
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,870
- He is the Inspector Chief Japp.
- Good, she is out.

230
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,830
- Good morning, Inspector Chief Japp.
- So, well... Good morning.

231
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,190
- Who is out?
- The Plenderleith.

232
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,910
It was playing bridge in the Essex
even to the midnight.

233
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,190
We will set aside the idea
of what she was wrapped.

234
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,590
What disillusionment.

235
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,460
It is still convinced
what one treats as a murder?

236
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,950
I have no doubts.

237
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,830
It wanted to ask about him a thing.

238
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,830
Because it was walking smelling
when we were in the room?

239
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,470
- Snif, snif. Is not it with a cold?
- No.

240
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,510
I always thought that you sweat them
grey cells were in the brain.

241
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,310
There does not say to me what in the nose, also!

242
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,910
Of all. It was only a smoke of cigarette.

243
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,820
- I did not smell cigarette.
- I also not, my expensive one.

244
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,630
There were nine pious women in the ashtray.
Six common ones, three Turks.

245
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,430
- Exactamente.
- Did it detect for the smell, without looking?

246
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,550
My nose is not relevant.
My nose did not register anything.

247
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,950
But the cells of the brain
did they register enough?

248
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,590
There were some signs,
does not it find?

249
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,390
We are going to speak again
with the Beauty queen Plenderleith, right?

250
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,190
Yes.

251
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,310
He knows, Inspector Chief,
any thing was lacking in that room.

252
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,430
But also there was something to more.

253
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,030
- Does he know what it is preoccupying me?
- I know.

254
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,980
- Does he know? How so?
- I saw it consulting

255
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,390
the check book of the Mrs. Allen.

256
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,750
You are very clever, Poirot.

257
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,950
And it noticed that you. Allen stood up
200 pounds in cash in the second one?

258
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,550
- And three months before, other 200.
- To serious?

259
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,340
Yes. But it was not
money none at the home.

260
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,350
I am afraid that one does not negotiate of
a case of suicide.

261
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,710
Was not it a suicide?

262
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,830
It is not possible to conclude for the position
what his friend if it committed suicide

263
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,230
we will consider
the hypothesis of ... murder.

264
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,110
Murder? Does it find?
What horror!

265
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,430
Awful, perhaps...
But ... impossible?

266
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,630
I suppose what is possible.

267
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,590
And murder is dug,
there would be a motive.

268
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,830
One asks about what he will want.

269
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,260
But I am not seeing how it could help.

270
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,120
In the second one at night,
you. Allen had a sight.

271
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,790
A 45-year-old man, military type,
moustache to the little brush, quite dressed

272
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,110
and guiding a Standard Swallow.
Does he know who is?

273
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,990
He seems to be Major Eustace.

274
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,310
- Who is Major Eustace?
- To Pipe it knew it in India.

275
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,190
It turned that there is one year
and we it were seeing turn and a half.

276
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,870
- He was a friend of the Mrs. Allen?
- It was held how if it was.

277
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,510
It would be surprised if he was saying to him
what he was blackmailing you. Allen?

278
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,070
Clear! Then it was that!

279
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,950
Clear!

280
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,310
Does it think that it is a hypothesis credível?

281
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,560
I was foolish in not having thought about that!
That it grieves it not to have called myself at all!

282
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,350
It had ordered it for the Devil!

283
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,620
But perhaps he has gone...
to have with you. Laverton-West?

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes ... yes, it is true.

285
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,470
In which room will you have. Allen
when his visit was received?

286
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,870
Probably here.

287
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,710
But she wanted to pass a cheque,
it is natural what was taking it there up.

288
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,790
Cheque was not necessary any.
She lifted 200 pounds in cash.

289
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,950
We still did not find money any
at the home.

290
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,510
But was he liking was seeing again, it can be?

291
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,630
- See to the will.
- Thank you.

292
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,270
- Does not it want to sit down?
- Thank you.

293
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,590
- A cigarette?
- It is very gentle.

294
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,870
This cupboard under the staircases...

295
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,910
It is closed.

296
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,910
Yes, already I noted.
Can it give me the key?

297
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,990
I ... I do not know where it is.

298
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,190
That it suffers!
It did not want to spoil the lock.

299
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,430
It must be up there.

300
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,030
I managed to find it.

301
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,710
The best!

302
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,670
It uses to be closed,
to protect the things.

303
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,390
Quite thought.

304
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,310
That is mine!

305
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,110
It brought it yesterday morning,
therefore it has not there anything.

306
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,590
It is not lost at all in certifying.

307
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,790
- It seems that it has not anything.
- No. Could it not even, it is not?

308
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,990
- Excuse to bother it again.
- Could not it wait?

309
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,030
This type of interrogation
it has his drawbacks.

310
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,670
I do not mind drawbacks,
one will have resulted.

311
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,990
It has some idea
of what you got a beating. Allen to the suicide?

312
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,190
Perhaps understand better
it will be said to him what was a murder.

313
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,230
- What he is saying?
- It has some idea

314
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,350
of whom it would have a presumable motive...

315
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,470
No! It is estranhíssimo!

316
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,350
The mere idea is ... inconceivable!

317
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,870
Does she ever speak in enemies?
Someone who had something against her?

318
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,390
Never.

319
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,400
- Does it know Major Eustace?
- Eustace?

320
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,470
Oh, yes ... I saw it once
at home of Barbara ... of the Mrs. Allen.

321
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,710
A doubtful type, as for me.
As a matter of fact, I commented with you. Allen.

322
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,110
It was not the man's type what I
it wanted to come to receive at home.

323
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,630
- Excuse, I have to dress myself.
- What you said. Allen?

324
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,790
It agreed.
It trusted my judgement.

325
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,110
And like my woman, it was natural
what was coming to consider

326
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,860
a great deal of the friends ... unsuitable.

327
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,630
Undoubtedly.

328
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,870
What he says to me of his movements
in the night of 5 of November?

329
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,910
Movements?

330
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,470
My movements?

331
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,630
It is only a question of routine.
We will ask everyone.

332
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,340
He was thinking that in my position
it was dispensed of these questions.

333
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,390
It is not quite so that it works.

334
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,990
Very well.

335
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,870
Let me think...

336
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,150
I was in the Chamber of the Common ones.

337
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,630
I left about 22:30.
I went for a walk near the Docks.

338
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,630
- I was seeing the fireworks.
- Be already no arguments of this!

339
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,910
- Then I walked up to house.
- To which hours did it arrive?

340
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,950
Between them 23:15 and them 23:30.

341
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,110
- Did anybody open the door?
- No.

342
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,030
- Did it find anybody in the way?
- No.

343
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,350
- What an alibi!
- It is so weak which debit to be true.

344
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,500
I am not preoccupied by him,
but with the Beauty queen Plenderleith.

345
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,390
It was liking realizing
that preoccupation with the suitcase.

346
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,990
This is more his type, Poirot:
To examine the trivialities in detail.

347
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,030
" The Mystery of the Walking Suitcase ".
It promises.

348
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,990
Is Major Eustace here?

349
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,230
- Major Eustace?
- Yes?

350
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,590
Inspector Chief Japp, Scotland Yard.

351
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,870
- Does it accept a drink?
- No, thank you. can We talk?

352
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,470
Yes. We go for there.

353
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,150
One feels, please.

354
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,420
It is not every day what I receive
someone at the level of an Inspector Chief.

355
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,470
- It smokes Turkish cigarettes.
- Yes.

356
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,590
Does it prefer of others? I have someone there...

357
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,030
No, so it is well. Thank you.

358
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,070
I suppose what you knew. Allen,
is not it so?

359
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,150
Yes, it knew.

360
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,870
A very sad history.
He knew yesterday for the newspapers.

361
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,310
- Do I believe what knew it in India?
- Yes. That was already that there are a few years.

362
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,310
- Also did it know the husband?
- No, by chance I never knew.

363
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,990
Does anything know them to me about him?

364
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,990
I heard that it was a bad type.

365
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,230
- It is clear what are only noises.
- You. does Allen ever speak on that?

366
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,070
Never.

367
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,390
He wanted to know if you saw. Allen
in the night of 5 of November.

368
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,270
I saw, yes.

369
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,030
- Was it up to her house?
- Exactamente.

370
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,070
She asked for me advices
on a few investments.

371
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,870
It did not give anyone signs
of what one was going to commit suicide?

372
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,110
Absolutely none.
When we say goodbye,

373
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,590
even I combined to phone to speak
on a show joined.

374
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,360
- Were last words his?
- Yes.

375
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,030
Snooper.
I have a different information.

376
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,750
To what I know, you said:
" Think about that, and then he talks to me. "

377
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,310
It is not well the same thing, is not it?

378
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,510
I must have said to him to call myself
it is when that I him could phone.

379
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,100
It is not to the wait that reminds of me
of each word that he said.

380
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,430
Excuse, Major...
We need more gin of the cupboard.

381
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,060
- Take away a few bottles, favor is done.
- Right.

382
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,670
- Is this Club his, Major Eustace?
- Who had given to me. It is a mine.

383
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,020
You. Allen asked for him opinion
on a few investments, was not it?

384
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,630
By chance did not she give him 200 pounds?

385
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,550
- What it means with that?
- You. Allen lifted 200 pounds.

386
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,350
Part erases in notes for five pounds.
They can be found by the numbers.

387
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,230
What a devil! Then find them!

388
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,110
- Find them ... I want to know there!
- The money was to invest,

389
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,150
or does it the question be blackmail?
- What a more insulting insinuation!

390
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,110
Ear, which happened was this...

391
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,510
I was up to her house.
It means, I phoned first...

392
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,630
- To which hours did it arrive there?
- Around 21:30.

393
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,950
- We sat down talking...
- And do they fume?

394
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,590
Yes ... we smoked.
What hardly has that?

395
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,590
- Where this conversation had place?
- In the living room.

396
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,910
As he was saying, we sat down
and we talked friendly

397
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,590
and I left about 22:30.

398
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,750
- Was it in the room during the whole visit?
- Yes.

399
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,390
- It did not rise to the room of the Mrs. Allen?
- No.

400
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,550
- Can I see his buttons of fist?
- The buttons of fist?

401
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,710
- It can refuse, is clear.
- I have not anything hiding.

402
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,310
- Is it when that that happened?
- What?

403
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,510
- One of them is broken.
- I know.

404
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,070
I noticed that this morning.
He does not see himself if I will put for inside.

405
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,460
It would be surprised if he was saying to him
what happened at home of the Mrs. Allen?

406
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,630
- I did not deny what I was there.
- Yes, but this piece of the button

407
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,630
it was not found in the room,
but yes in the room of the Mrs. Allen.

408
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,710
In the same siege where it was murdered.

409
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,430
And where a man was seated
smoking the same cigarettes than you.

410
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,510
Is it trying to incriminate me?
I did not return any more to the house in that night.

411
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,430
It was not necessary.
She was killed when it went out.

412
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,310
No! Wait there!

413
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,110
You said that someone me heard
with It to Had begun to have a beard in the entry...

414
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,750
They heard him speaking with her.
And to pretend that it was obtaining answer

415
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,710
and he was speaking again.
It is an ancient, expensive trick of mine.

416
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,750
Good Lord! it is not true.

417
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,070
I need of asking for him
what accompanies me even to the squad.

418
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,910
Good Lord!

419
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,830
- Favor is done.
- Say.

420
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,070
- I can speak with you. Plenderleith?
- It could, if she was.

421
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,750
- It played golf.
- Golf?

422
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,060
Between. And to think that you. Allen
it still lies frozen in that morgue.

423
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,880
It is true.
Is this very painful, Sra...?

424
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,550
- Pierce, darling.
- My name is Hercule Poirot.

425
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,020
Oh, already I heard of you.

426
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,510
I am very much flattered.

427
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,270
Mrs. Pierce, I am with a problem...

428
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,550
- Do not say.
- I came here yesterday with the Inspector Japp

429
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,740
and we forget of looking for traces
in a specific siege of the house.

430
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,430
- It will be that it might...
- Between, make itself at home.

431
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,950
It is very kind.
Thank you.

432
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,030
My old man is going to be green with envy
when he will know that it was here.

433
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,150
- It is always reading it in the newspapers.
- It is very kind.

434
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,190
- Do I can?
- Clear, continue!

435
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,670
It was offering soon a drink,
he was going to talk about the nonsenses in the newspapers...

436
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,030
Mrs. Pierce,

437
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,150
it is where that the Beauty queen Plenderleith
does it usually play golf?

438
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,310
He is sure that this is allowed,
Captain Hastings?

439
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,150
The name of Poirot is feared in
any golf course of the continent.

440
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,870
- Has not it been certifying of handicap?
- No, no. I am well.

441
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,950
There had to be somewhere a hole
for where to throw the ball...

442
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,110
Does he see that flag?

443
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,190
No.

444
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,230
- In front of the big tree ... I redden.
- I am seeing!

445
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,630
- It is where the hole is.
- No...

446
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,830
We wait.

447
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,550
Promptly. Only it has to beat him with this.

448
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,510
Go.

449
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,190
- Can I be right in the flag?
- Yes, it is not important.

450
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,740
It does not look to me
what is going to be right in the flag.

451
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,750
Little luck!

452
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,550
With so many shots of every time,
we do not catch the Beauty queen Plenderleith!

453
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,510
It is not possible.
She began that there is hour and a half.

454
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,620
We can see it to the turn
in the parallel holes.

455
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,710
It was liking what was stopping
of rummaging through the garbage.

456
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,470
- More not!
- Number three, Hastings!

457
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,910
Someone is having a bad day.
It is normal cues leave.

458
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,830
- Three cues in three holes?
- Well then?

459
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,900
The Beauty queen Plenderleith
it is being free of the cues

460
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,420
in a siege where it was judging
what nobody would notice.

461
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,230
Major Eustace is not blamed,
Hastings.

462
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,870
- Did it lose the ball again?
- Be hidden!

463
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,820
See.

464
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,030
We already saw the sufficient thing.
We will leave

465
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,990
this so interesting play
and to phone to an Inspector Japp.

466
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,710
Because there would be a normal young person
of throwing an expensive suitcase for a lake

467
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,420
with only two magazines and stones
to guarantee what was sunk?

468
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,830
Do not be preoccupied any more.
We already have the answer.

469
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,470
And why to leave
a set of perfect cues?

470
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,590
I am not going to lie they.
I passed the night woken thinking.

471
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,030
My poor person Japp.

472
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,310
- The Beauty queen Plenderleith.
- Thank you, Beauty queen Lemon.

473
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,310
Excuse the delay.
I had just come from the funeral one of the Pipe.

474
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,700
It was very kind in having come.
One feels, please.

475
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,510
- I have news for you.
- I read in the newspaper.

476
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,190
Major Eustace was imprisoned.
Was always it a murder?

477
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,430
Yes. The destruction of a human being
for work of other.

478
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,190
And now I am going to say to him
since I reached the truth.

479
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,030
He has his methods.
I do not contradict it.

480
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,910
To begin,
the smell of the smoke of cigarette.

481
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,550
- What I did not smell.
- Precisely!

482
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,870
And however the ashtray
it had at least nine cigarettes.

483
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,310
It was strange what the room was smelling
as fresh as it was smelling.

484
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,430
Then it was that!

485
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,590
Then it was the watch
what the dead woman was using.

486
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,630
- Are it what what had?
- It was in the right wrist.

487
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,470
For my experience,
it is more worn-out in the left wrist.

488
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,150
But now, my men
we go to the part of the writing.

489
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,150
It was already to the wait.

490
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,270
The block of letter was how
one had not written in him.

491
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,350
To Pipe it did not write anything in this day,
therefore the leaf was clean.

492
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,590
It had, yes. Freddie saw it
to go to the mail in this day to 18:00.

493
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,990
Very well, Hastings!

494
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,380
Then what happened to the leaf
where she had written the letters?

495
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,910
But there was another curious detail
about the writing desk.

496
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,630
Perhaps one remembers, Japp,
of the arrangement of the things?

497
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,670
Allow me.

498
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,950
Paint and block of letter to the centre,

499
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,460
inkwell on the left,

500
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,430
calendar
and pen of feather on the right.

501
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,590
- Eh bien!
- Yes?

502
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,750
Is not he seeing?
The inkwell was on the left.

503
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,830
Is not it more common to be on the right?
More to the hand of the right hand?

504
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,640
Then I imagined the next thing, Japp.

505
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,270
I imagined the Beauty queen Plenderleith
reaching house after weekend.

506
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,270
I saw it reaching house
and finding the friend

507
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,150
lying in the ground
with the pistol in the hand.

508
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,750
In the left hand, clear.
She was left-handed.

509
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,390
In spite of the Beauty queen Plenderleith
in trying to convince otherwise.

510
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,500
Also there was a note gone to you.

511
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,830
For right, a very moving letter,

512
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,270
on a young victim of blackmail,

513
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,550
what took it committing suicide.

514
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,590
I think that it robbed the idea
in the same instant.

515
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,950
He will be punished!

516
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,470
It withdraws the note and the leaf in the top
of the block of letter.

517
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,430
Go down the staircase, it lights the bonfire,

518
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,070
and it launches them to the flames.

519
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,270
It takes the ashtray to the room,

520
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,710
simulating the conversation
of two persons.

521
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,870
It has a blow of luck.

522
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,390
It discovers
a bit of the button of fist in the room.

523
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,350
It takes it also to the room.
And wait that that puts the question in order.

524
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,790
It takes from him the pistol of the left hand.

525
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,590
Clean it and it places it in the left hand.

526
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,510
Lock the window and it closes the door.

527
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,910
There must not be tracks
of what you altered things in the room.

528
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,980
And it was so.
It was very intelligent, mademoiselle.

529
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,340
A very intelligent murder.
So it was that that it the question was...

530
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,910
Of the attempt of murder
of Major Eustace.

531
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,230
It was not a murder...
It was a justice!

532
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,710
That man pursued to Pipe
even to the death! Poor girl ...!

533
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,110
Completely because she became involved with one
man married in India and it had a baby.

534
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,660
When the child died,
it returned for England.

535
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,100
It knew it Chatter
and he fell in love with him...

536
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,620
One has no idea why, pompous that one...

537
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,230
And then that swindler of Eustace
he returns of India.

538
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,140
There was read the letter what it links it wrote to me,
it was realizing because I did what I did.

539
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,150
She was loving it Chatter, it wrote it.
He was not managing to live without him.

540
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,030
But for his good,
he was not going to marry with him.

541
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,550
It was going to take the most right decision.
It would of read that letter!

542
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,670
And still call him a murder!

543
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,390
And it was a murder! The man
what it tried to incriminate, is in the prison.

544
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,230
Want even I destroyed it?

545
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,190
It wants to destroy even the life...
the mind...

546
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,510
... of a human being?

547
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,150
No ... I do not want.

548
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,310
He was liking wanting, I do not want them to myself.

549
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,350
It is not possible!

550
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,300
Disguised suicide of murder
and not the opposite.

551
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,230
And quite thought.
Not too at all affected.

552
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,310
Wait there!
Then and the suitcase? And the cues?

553
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,110
They were of the Mrs. Allen. Jane
Plenderleith was having to convince us

554
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,910
what his friendly skilful era
to believe in murder.

555
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,950
- But the cues were for stubs!
- Clear!

556
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,990
When she opened the cupboard... It tried
at what we were looking for another object...

557
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,150
It used the suitcase like...
How he calls himself? How I bait?

558
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,550
- To throw off the scent.
- That itself!

559
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,310
And now, my friends,
it is a height of we go to have lunch.

560
