1
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,083
Come on.

2
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,958
You have a go.

3
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,624
£50,000?

4
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,999
£50,000.

5
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,124
The last letter said £30,000.

6
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,583
And the one before that,
£25,000.

7
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,874
You didn't tell me
there was another one.

8
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,541
I didn't take it seriously.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,541
Damn it all, Ada,
this is England.

10
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,749
People don't go around
kidnapping children!

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,499
Come on, car. Try harder, car.

12
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,791
Up.

13
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,624
Oh.

14
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,124
Careful, Mommy.
Mind the car.

15
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,708
-Miss Lemon?
-Yes, Mr. Poirot?

16
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,416
It is nearly 11:00.

17
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,749
It is important that I have
my tisane punctually.

18
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,583
Of course, Mr. Poirot.

19
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,583
It's nearly complete, you see --
my system.

20
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,583
Ah.

21
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,124
Every one of your cases,

22
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,749
classified and cross-referenced
five different ways.

23
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:36,374
Five?

24
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,749
Oh, yes.

25
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,999
In this cabinet,
names of witnesses,

26
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,499
in this, name of perpetrator,
if known,

27
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,291
victim's trade or profession,
type of case --

28
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,041
abduction, addiction,

29
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,833
adultery,
see also under "marriage,"

30
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,124
bigamy, see also
under "marriage," bombs.

31
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,374
See also under "marriage"?

32
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,541
Mr. Waverly to see you,
Mr. Poirot.

33
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,916
M. Waverly, good morning.

34
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,374
How do you do?

35
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,333
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

36
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,208
You may now go back
to your filing.

37
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,916
Miss Lemon dreams of
the perfect filing system

38
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:54,333
besides which all other filing
systems will sink into oblivion.

39
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:58,583
This morning she is close
to the breakthrough.

40
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:07,333
Now, what brings you
to consult Hercule Poirot?

41
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,416
They've accepted me.

42
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:18,916
-Accepted?
-Le Mans.

43
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,666
You remember I was trying to
enter the Lagonda.

44
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,708
I got the entry form
this morning.

45
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,999
Not that I can make
head or tail of it.

46
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,583
How exciting.

47
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,333
There's another Lagonda entered
by Tommy Branston.

48
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,166
Have you done racing before?

49
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,333
No.
Well, not really.

50
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,499
Who's in with Poirot?

51
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,416
A Mr. Waverly.

52
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,791
It's a case.

53
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,708
This morning I received this.

54
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:49,041
"You have not paid.

55
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:52,791
Your son will be taken from you
at 12:00 tomorrow, the 29th.

56
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,541
It will cost you £50,000
to recover him."

57
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,916
£50,000?

58
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:02,624
Damned impertinence.

59
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,833
Well, do you have £50,000,
M. Waverly?

60
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,374
Well, I daresay
I might be able to raise it.

61
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:09,833
I see.

62
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,458
You don't really think
they'll do anything, do you?

63
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,374
Mais certainement.
I see no reason to doubt it.

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,541
Good God.

65
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,791
Please allow me to introduce you
to Captain Hastings,

66
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:20,958
an associate of mine.

67
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,166
M. Waverly, a client.

68
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,958
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

69
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:27,791
M. Waverly has received letters
threatening to kidnap his son.

70
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,041
Really?

71
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,666
In England?

72
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,874
Could be some band of
foreigners, you know, some gang.

73
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:41,124
These letters give no indication
that the writer is a foreigner.

74
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,499
Is there anyone you suspect,
M. Waverly?

75
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,874
Good God, no.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,083
No one who might bear you
the grudge?

77
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,749
Don't think so.
No.

78
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,999
Very well.

79
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,791
Poirot must himself intercede.

80
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,541
Have you shown to Scotland Yard
this latest letter?

81
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,124
No, I came straight to you.

82
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,708
Didn't see much point.

83
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,124
They didn't seem interested
the first time.

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,374
Oh, I understand
your feelings, monsieur,

85
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,916
but now we have once again

86
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:11,083
to interview the intrepid
Chief Inspector Japp.

87
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:13,874
I don't want to be away
from home too long.

88
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,458
Five minutes, no more,
M. Waverly,

89
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,666
for me to pack a bag.

90
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,458
And then we shall board
the next train,

91
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,708
having seen the inspector
on the way.

92
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,833
Oh, I can drive you down.

93
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,791
No, no, mon ami, I would not
dream of imposing on you.

94
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,708
Oh, she could do
with a bit of a run.

95
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,249
It is not a dog, Hastings.

96
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,874
We'll meet you there
this afternoon.

97
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:44,916
Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings and
I will be away until tomorrow.

98
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:46,499
Hold the castle.

99
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,874
Chief Inspector Japp
can see you now, gentlemen.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,124
Ah.

101
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,458
Thank you.

102
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,333
Well, well, well.

103
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,291
Good morning, Chief Inspector.

104
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,333
This is an unexpected pleasure,
Mr. Poirot.

105
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,708
Mr. Waverly.

106
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,749
M. Waverly has received
another letter.

107
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,791
Oh?

108
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,083
M. Waverly felt that
Scotland Yard was not convinced

109
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,208
about the seriousness
of the case.

110
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,499
So he came to you,
eh, Mr. Poirot?

111
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:29,124
M. Waverly is a man of fine
judgment and intelligence.

112
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,499
Perhaps this is
a serious matter.

113
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,291
You think so, eh?

114
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,958
I think better the safeness than
the sorrow, Chief Inspector.

115
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,749
Very true, Mr. Poirot,
very true,

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,624
if you've got
unlimited manpower.

117
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,708
We see a hundred of these
every day, Mr. Waverly.

118
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,291
If we was to go chasing about
after every one --

119
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,208
A hundred, Chief Inspector?

120
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,041
Well, perhaps not a hundred.

121
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,458
Mustn't be too literal,
Mr. Poirot.

122
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,499
Ah.

123
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,874
Every day?

124
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,374
Every week, anyway.

125
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,999
This is some disaffected
employee, some envious neighbor.

126
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,791
We're wasting our time,
Mr. Poirot.

127
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,624
No call to take umbrage,
Mr. Waverly.

128
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,374
I'm a simple country squire.

129
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,374
I pay my taxes, and I'm used to
something in return.

130
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,083
Now I know better.

131
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,416
There are a lot of taxpayers,
Mr. Waverly.

132
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,958
There are even quite a lot
of country squires.

133
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:21,999
If we was to --

134
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,374
You're not only uncooperative,
sir.

135
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,249
You're damned offensive.

136
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,166
As you so rightly point out,

137
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,333
you are paying me to exercise
my judgment and discretion

138
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,666
as to what is a serious threat
to public order and what is not,

139
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,416
and this is not.

140
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,583
Your superior
shall hear of this.

141
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,999
I hope he enjoys it
as much as I have.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,833
That policeman's a fool.

143
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,083
Ah, no.

144
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,708
Japp is a good policeman.

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,583
Prevention of crime is not
what policemen are best at.

146
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,958
They would need to have
one constable for every citizen

147
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,749
and go everywhere with him.

148
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,958
But fortunately
for the human race,

149
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,583
most of us have our own
little policeman up here.

150
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:20,874
But this kidnapper has, perhaps,
no little policeman.

151
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,208
Thank you.

152
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,708
C'est magnifique.

153
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,791
This is the new house,

154
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,333
built by an ancestor of mine
in 1760,

155
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,541
when the old manor was destroyed
by fire.

156
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,333
And you are adding
to your kinsman's great work?

157
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,916
No, we embarked
on a program of restoration

158
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,583
about five years ago.

159
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,166
We've had to stop for a bit,

160
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,124
but I hope we can get going
again soon.

161
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,291
There have been Waverlys
in these parts for 400 years.

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,416
400?

163
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,749
And this land around here
is all yours?

164
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,208
Not anymore.

165
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:30,333
Used to be, as far as you
could see from the roof...

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,916
but not anymore.

167
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,666
Marcus, you're back.

168
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:54,124
Ada, this is
Mr. Hercules Poirot.

169
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,249
Enchanté, madame.

170
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,374
-Hercule.
-What?

171
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,791
Not Hercules, but Hercule.

172
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,374
Oh, quite.
Famous detective.

173
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,208
I know.

174
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,666
I'm so glad you're here,
Mr. Poirot.

175
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,958
We didn't know where to turn.

176
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,541
The police will apparently
do nothing.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,416
One is forced to pay for peace
of mind out of one's own pocket.

178
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,749
But Captain Hastings has told me

179
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,249
your charges
are quite reasonable.

180
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,583
Indeed?

181
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,624
Oh, well, I didn't specify,
of course --

182
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,791
just in general terms.

183
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:27,833
Ah.

184
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,791
You have got here with alacrity,
my friend.

185
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,041
75 minutes, door to door.
Touched 80 on the hog's-back.

186
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,958
Captain Hastings
is besotted by cars.

187
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,458
He was kind enough to tell me

188
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,166
about the 24-hour race
he's going in for.

189
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,041
We have serious business here,
Hastings.

190
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,333
Let us not lose sight of this.

191
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,083
Oh. Oh, the kidnapping business,
you mean.

192
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,291
Yes, I had a word
with Mrs. Waverly about that.

193
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,499
I don't think there's too much
to worry about.

194
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,791
Work of a crank, those letters,
I'd say.

195
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,291
That's very reassuring,
Hastings. Thank you.

196
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:02,166
But we must not try to walk
before we can jump, eh?

197
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,624
I will see the house now,
M. Waverly.

198
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,666
Oh, by all means.

199
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,541
Well, this is
the sitting room --

200
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,958
opens out onto the terrace,

201
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,833
through the French windows
there.

202
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,874
Bon.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,208
And this is the south side
of the house, yes?

204
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,249
Exactly.

205
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,499
And this room is
communicating...

206
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,708
With the library.

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,249
Ah.

208
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,166
Bon.

209
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:27,499
Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

210
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:29,499
Thank you.

211
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,958
All will be well, madame.

212
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,083
Kidnapping is an easy job,
mon ami.

213
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,541
-Easy?
-Mais certainement.

214
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,958
That child could have been
abducted at any time

215
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,291
since his birth,
oh, 4 years ago?

216
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,999
Well, I don't see that
that advances us much.

217
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,291
Au contraire.

218
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,958
It advances us enormously,
but enormously.

219
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,666
We must ask ourselves
why they make things difficult

220
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,666
by warning the Waverlys.

221
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,416
Oh, some cases are simple,
and some are très compliqué.

222
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,624
But all are of interest, eh,

223
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,791
because all, you understand,

224
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,916
rest solely on the character
of the participants.

225
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,624
Certainly.

226
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,124
Forgive me.

227
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,124
It's difficult to make
casual conversation

228
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,499
when tomorrow we may...

229
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,249
He's ready for bed now,
Mrs. Waverly.

230
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,874
Say good night, Johnnie.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,999
Ah, so this is
the famous Johnnie Waverly.

232
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,958
Good night, old chap.

233
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,041
My car.

234
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,833
I say.
That's rather fine.

235
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,166
You see, Hastings?

236
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,541
A fellow enthusiast.

237
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,666
Come and tuck me up, Mommy.

238
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,083
I'll come up in a minute,
darling.

239
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,333
Thank you, Mrs. Withers.

240
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:12,124
Good night.

241
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,249
Darling.

242
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,541
Come on, darling.

243
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,083
It'll be all right.

244
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,791
Certainly,
it will be all right, madame.

245
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:36,249
At noon tomorrow, Johnnie will
be surrounded by his friend,

246
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,249
by his mother, his father,

247
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,666
Hastings...

248
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,791
by Poirot.

249
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:48,791
No one will kidnap
Johnnie Waverly.

250
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,791
It's Mrs. Waverly.

251
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,916
She's been taken ill.

252
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,291
Suddenly woke up
with dreadful cramps.

253
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,333
-Doctor's with her now.
-Cramps?

254
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,333
It must be something
she's eaten.

255
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,583
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,208
I'm sorry if we woke you.

257
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,749
Ah.

258
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,083
Bonjour, mon ami.

259
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,916
You slept well?

260
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,458
Fine.

261
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,833
Excellent.

262
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,291
And now we enjoy
the famous English breakfast.

263
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,208
Well, you may.

264
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,708
What are you having, Hastings?

265
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,458
Well, I think it's kedgeree.

266
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:47,499
Certainly rice.

267
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,041
I can't find anything else
in it.

268
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:57,374
But, Hastings, where is
this famous English breakfast?

269
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,083
Well, didn't you notice
at dinner last night?

270
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,041
Just one potato each --
not a big one -- one cutlet.

271
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,958
Ah, mais oui,
but from an English dinner,

272
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,666
one expects no more.

273
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,041
But breakfast?

274
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,041
I wonder if they're not short
of money, you know?

275
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,333
The fire wasn't lit in my room
last night.

276
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,541
Well, get them here now,
this instant,

277
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,333
every man jack of them,
Tredwell!

278
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Very good, sir.

279
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:24,458
Oh, good morning.

280
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,208
Bonjour, M. Waverly.

281
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:29,291
And how is Mme. Waverly
this morning?

282
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,749
She's still weak.

283
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,666
She won't be able to get up
today.

284
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,916
But there's worse.

285
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,041
Look at this.

286
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:40,916
In my own bedroom.

287
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,791
I went for my bath.

288
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,333
I wasn't more than 10 minutes.

289
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,041
When I got back, there it was,
pinned to my pillow.

290
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,291
Just three words --
"At twelve o'clock."

291
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,583
The nerve of the fellow.

292
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,958
Precisely!

293
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,333
There's a traitor somewhere.

294
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:55,999
Someone on my staff.

295
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:59,291
Well, I know a trick worth
two of that.

296
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,708
What are you going to do?

297
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:01,874
Sack them.

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,249
Sack the lot of them.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,124
Unless one of them owns up,
of course.

300
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,083
Tredwell will stay, of course.

301
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,999
He's been here
since I was a boy.

302
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,458
And Miss Collins.

303
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,083
I'm sorry. Miss Collins?

304
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,291
My wife's secretary.
Nothing wrong with her.

305
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,874
My God.

306
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,249
I can't abide a traitor!

307
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:24,624
The staff are assembled,
Mr. Waverly.

308
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:26,416
Thank you, Tredwell.

309
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,624
M. Waverly,
I ask you to reconsider.

310
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,583
The emptier a house is,

311
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,083
the easier it will be for a
miscreant to move about unseen.

312
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,583
Nonsense.

313
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,041
Mr. Poirot, you stick to your
job, and I shall stick to mine.

314
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,791
Then we shan't fall out.

315
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,208
But to empty your house

316
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,833
a few hours before
the threatened abduction

317
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,041
seems to me to be
the height of folly.

318
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,624
How dare you, sir?

319
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,541
You call me a fool?

320
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,958
I'm doing what I consider best
for the defense of my son.

321
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,791
Allow me to be
the judge of that.

322
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,833
I cannot prevent you, monsieur.

323
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,041
Quite.

324
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,208
He is stubborn, that one,
Hastings.

325
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,833
Mon Dieu,
wonders will never stop.

326
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,458
The Chief Inspector Japp.

327
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,333
Line up in a straight line.

328
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,124
A change of heart,
Chief Inspector?

329
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,624
Yes, you might say that,
Mr. Poirot.

330
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,291
Or you might say I don't want to
see some poor amateur

331
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,333
get himself in a fix.

332
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,916
Ah, you are too kind,
Chief Inspector Japp.

333
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,708
Your great heart
will be your downfall.

334
00:20:58,209 --> 00:20:59,416
True, true.

335
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,208
Now, then, where's
the simple country squire?

336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,916
You will find him in the hall,
sacking all his staff.

337
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,499
Oh, dear.

338
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,291
Got out of bed the wrong side,
did he?

339
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,666
Perhaps.

340
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,083
Bonne chance.

341
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,249
One of you is responsible.

342
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,583
I expect an answer.

343
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,541
Well?

344
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,041
I'm waiting.

345
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,291
Not too fast, mind.

346
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,541
Don't worry.
I won't go over 80.

347
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,874
Kilometers?

348
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,374
Miles.

349
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,333
Whatever happens, Hastings,
we must be back before 12:00.

350
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,083
I will not be treated
in this manner.

351
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:58,791
There is nothing more to be
said, Mrs. Withers.

352
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,749
There is a great deal more to be
said, Mr. Waverly.

353
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,999
I will not --

354
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,249
You may pack your bag

355
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,874
and collect a week's wages
from Miss Collins.

356
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,208
And what am I supposed to tell
Johnnie?

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,541
You will say nothing to him.

358
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,791
He is in Miss Collins' care
for the moment.

359
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,499
You may go, Mrs. Withers.

360
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,083
What are you doing here?

361
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,291
Morning, Mr. Waverly.

362
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,249
I've brought some men down
with me.

363
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,291
I'll disperse them
around the house,

364
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,958
if that's agreeable to you, sir.

365
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,291
You were doing the building work
up at Waverly, were you?

366
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,624
Will be again soon.

367
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,749
So he keeps telling me.

368
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,041
Ted.
I'll believe it when I see it.

369
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,833
I don't reckon she cares about
the house, that sort of thing.

370
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,791
-Really?
-No.

371
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:49,249
The whole place could fall down,
as far as she's concerned.

372
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,708
She's the one with the money,

373
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,624
though you'd never know it,
the way she carries on.

374
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,083
Ted.

375
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,874
Right, one man
at the head of the path

376
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,374
that leads to the stables there.

377
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,791
Right. Beacham,
at the head of the stables.

378
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:04,833
Sir.

379
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,916
One man by the main door,
of course.

380
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,291
-Osborne, by the front door.
-Yes, Sergeant.

381
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,791
Two on the perimeter.

382
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,499
-George, Smith.
-Yes, sir.

383
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,083
And a couple here by the...

384
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,666
-Servants' quarters?
-That's it.

385
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,541
And scrambled eggs, was it?

386
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,333
Mais certainement,
and the little sausages?

387
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:29,583
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Deviled kidneys?

388
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,708
Kidneys, yes.
What about bacon?

389
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,333
-Crisp.
-Of course.

390
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,249
And tea?
Or a nice pint of home brew?

391
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,708
Beer for breakfast?

392
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,999
Two pints, please.

393
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:43,791
But, Hastings, we've got to be
back before 12:00.

394
00:23:43,917 --> 00:23:45,874
Plenty of time.

395
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,541
Right you are, gentlemen.

396
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,416
What an admirable young woman.

397
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,708
So, Hastings, the renovations
at Waverly Court will continue.

398
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,208
I didn't trust that builder,
you know, Poirot.

399
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,416
Seems to me he resents
the Waverlys.

400
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,874
Perhaps.

401
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,416
Good!

402
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,583
Johnnie will be in here with me,

403
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,208
with perhaps you here
by the windows

404
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,416
and Poirot guarding the door
into the hall.

405
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,749
I don't know about that, sir.

406
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,416
If there was to be
any rough stuff,

407
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:16,624
I don't know as Mr. Poirot

408
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,458
would be the first person
I'd think of.

409
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:19,833
Brain work -- yes.

410
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:21,624
Rough stuff -- dubious.

411
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,041
What about his colleague --
Hastings?

412
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,041
That would be more like it, sir.

413
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,124
Do you know what I think?

414
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,458
I think someone's tampered
with this.

415
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,833
Someone's tampered with this
to keep us out of the way.

416
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,624
How would they have known
we were going to use the car?

417
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,291
Ah.

418
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,791
Carefully.

419
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,624
Gently now, Johnnie.

420
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,041
Stroke her gently.

421
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,249
She likes it.

422
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,499
She likes you.

423
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,833
And how are you feeling now,
darling?

424
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,333
Oh, I feel heaps better.

425
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,166
Must have been something I ate.

426
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,291
Well, you just stay in bed
and rest.

427
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,124
I'm going to take Johnnie down
with me now.

428
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,749
Why can't he stay?

429
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,999
Well, he'll be happier
downstairs.

430
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,708
Miss Collins can stay with you.

431
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,041
-Bye-bye, darling.
-Bye-bye.

432
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,458
Come on.
Up you come.

433
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:35,374
Sure you don't need me?

434
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,416
No, no.

435
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,458
You keep Mrs. Waverly company
just for half an hour.

436
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,749
Bye, Mommy.

437
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,791
Bye.

438
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,583
Well, it's not the carburetor,
anyway.

439
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,791
This is not
what I long to hear, Hastings.

440
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:51,833
Eh?

441
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,499
I want to hear what it was,
not what it was not.

442
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:01,624
Better still,
I want to hear the motor!

443
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,458
And two blasts on the whistle
if anyone's apprehended.

444
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,499
Right, sir.

445
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:11,249
-The men all in position?
-Yes, sir.

446
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:12,541
Where the hell is Poirot?

447
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,583
They went out in the car, sir,
just as I was arriving.

448
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,874
Right, Sergeant.
Keep the men on their toes.

449
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,208
In the car?

450
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,249
Do you know
where they were going?

451
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,958
They didn't confide in me, sir,
I'm afraid.

452
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,874
Huh.

453
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,249
Vroom vroom!

454
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:20,958
Beep beep beep!

455
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:22,833
Vroom vroom!

456
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:27,291
Vroom! Beep beep!

457
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,624
He's right over there!

458
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,833
Right!
Come on!

459
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,083
We've got him, sir!

460
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,958
We've got him -- sneaking
through the bushes.

461
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:32,833
He's got the whole dope outfit
on him.

462
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:40,416
Look at this, sir.

463
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,624
Do you know this man, sir?

464
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,249
Never set eyes on him.

465
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:47,083
Here's a pretty parcel,
if you like --

466
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:49,666
bottle of chloroform,
cotton-wool pad,

467
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,541
and a letter addressed to you,
Mr. Waverly.

468
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,499
I don't know anything
about this.

469
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,999
I was given that to deliver.

470
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,041
Who by?

471
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,708
By a gentleman,
a gentleman I met on the road.

472
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,166
"You should have paid up.

473
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,583
To ransom your son
will now cost you £70,000.

474
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,624
In spite of all
your precautions,

475
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:13,499
he has been abducted at 12:00
on the 29th, as I said."

476
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,583
I should have paid up, should I?

477
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,666
You think you could --

478
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,749
Johnnie.

479
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,958
12:00.

480
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:45,124
Come on.

481
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,374
Come on, you.

482
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,166
Mon Dieu, the agony.

483
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,499
Are you going to do
something, or are you not?

484
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,083
When the time comes to act,
Poirot will act.

485
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:35,333
A pleasing little problem, huh,
obscure and charming.

486
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,791
Someone fools us all

487
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,916
simply by putting the clock
forward 10 minutes.

488
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,166
"Pleasing"?

489
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,458
"Charming"?

490
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:48,916
My child has been kidnapped.

491
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,249
Ah, oui, madame, but he is safe.

492
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,874
Rest assured, those miscreants

493
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,999
will take the greatest care
of him.

494
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,666
Is he not to them the goose
that lays the golden egg?

495
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,083
Nobody's seen hide
nor hair of that car.

496
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,291
I've given the Surrey police
a full description,

497
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,791
but he'll probably switch cars
as soon as he can

498
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,416
or go to earth somewhere.

499
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,749
And what about the ruffian
you caught?

500
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:18,833
Name's Joe Rogers -- so he says.

501
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,249
He's sticking to his story,
anyhow.

502
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,416
Perhaps Poirot can move him.

503
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,124
Ah, with all due respect,
Mr. Poirot,

504
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,291
if my lads can't shift him...

505
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,083
Poirot shall act.

506
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,249
Ah, Captain Hastings.

507
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,708
The voiture -- it is recovered?

508
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:50,083
Damn thing was out of petrol.
The gauge is stuck at "full."

509
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,791
Come. We have work to do.
The boy is gone.

510
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,958
I know.
One of the bobbies told me.

511
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,249
Bonjour, M. Rogers.

512
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,458
Yeah.

513
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:07,583
He's saying "good day,"
you ignorant man.

514
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:08,958
Mm.

515
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,333
I would like you, please,

516
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,874
to tell me your story again,
monsieur --

517
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,458
how you came into possession
of the package.

518
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,208
Oh, I told him all that.

519
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,874
Tell me.

520
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:26,291
Well, this geezer give it to me,
didn't he?

521
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:27,374
Did he?

522
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,624
Well, I just told you.

523
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,624
And what did he say,
this geezer?

524
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,833
He said I was to take
the package

525
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,041
and to deliver it
to the big house --

526
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,749
"at the side door," he said.

527
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,999
Well, he gave me a 10-bob note,
he did.

528
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,999
He said I was to deliver it
at 10 to 12:00, spot on.

529
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,124
And what time did you meet him?
Do you know?

530
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,124
Yeah, I do, as it happens.

531
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:51,666
It was a quarter past 10:00.

532
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:55,083
And can you describe him?

533
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,458
Well, there was something queer
about him.

534
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,833
He wasn't tall --
well, no taller nor me --

535
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,291
and he wore a 'tache.

536
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,874
-'Tache?
-Mustache.

537
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,124
Ah.

538
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,041
And he was all dressed up
in a sort of gray uniform,

539
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,041
with leggings and a cap.

540
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,416
-Like a chauffeur, you mean?
-Ah.

541
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:17,333
How old a man was he?

542
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,124
Oh, I don't know.

543
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,833
It's funny, though.

544
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,791
His voice was queer, too.

545
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:24,999
You know what?

546
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,999
You know that fellow running
around here in a monkey suit,

547
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,041
the toffee-nosed one?

548
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,833
The toffee-nosed -- monkey suit?

549
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,208
You know,
is he the butler or something?

550
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,874
Anyway, if he was to have a son,

551
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,874
that's just what this geezer
would have looked like.

552
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,208
Like M. Tredwell's son?

553
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,458
Don't get excited, Mr. Poirot.

554
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,208
M. Tredwell was with Mr. Waverly
every minute

555
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,916
between 10:00 and half-past.

556
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:50,041
I got that from Mr. Waverly
already.

557
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,708
But has M. Tredwell got a son?

558
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,124
Well, some other explanation
will present itself.

559
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,249
Thank you, M. Japp.

560
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,166
You have been most helpful.

561
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:05,833
And you, M. Rogers.

562
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,791
Oh, well, thanks very much.

563
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,291
Never you mind about that,
my lad.

564
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,458
I'm taking you down
the local lockup.

565
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,291
-What's the charge?
-Vagrancy.

566
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:16,583
But you can't do that.

567
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:18,208
I've got 10 bob in my pocket.

568
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,249
Tell the magistrate
all about it.

569
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,083
Come on, lads.

570
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,708
I'm going back to London
to organize a search there.

571
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,374
The answer is here, my friend,
not in London.

572
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:35,291
That's as may be, Mr. Poirot,
but the boy's in London.

573
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,458
I'll lay odds on that.

574
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:38,833
Good day to you.

575
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,291
Ah, M. Tredwell, come in.

576
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,999
Come in and sit down.

577
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,666
I would prefer to stand, sir,
if it's all the same to you.

578
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,541
By all means.

579
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,083
You have worked here
for many years, huh?

580
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:17,999
30 years, sir.

581
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,708
I came as an under-footman.

582
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,583
Of course, there was a much
larger staff in those days.

583
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:23,624
I see.

584
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,999
So, if anyone knows
the family secrets,

585
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,499
it would be you, n'est-ce pas?

586
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,749
I am sure, sir, there are no
secrets in the Waverly family.

587
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,249
Of course not.

588
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,583
Mr. Waverly is the most upright
of men,

589
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,833
he and his father before him.

590
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,458
Of course.

591
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,874
And Mme. Waverly?

592
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,041
A happy marriage, huh?

593
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,208
I'm sure, sir.
Mrs. Waverly is a fine woman.

594
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,749
Of course, she has made changes.

595
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,916
This is not the sort
of establishment

596
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,291
that she was brought up to,
for all her money.

597
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,666
Quite.

598
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:58,749
But --

599
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,583
Well, I think she's beginning
to appreciate the Waverly way.

600
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,541
Miss Collins, can I ask you
about the boy's nurse?

601
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,083
She'd only been here
for about six months.

602
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:10,291
Was she trustworthy?

603
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,374
Eminently,
I should have thought.

604
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,041
And she'd left the house by the
time of the kidnapping, anyway.

605
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,916
Quite so, quite so.

606
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:22,499
But she may have had accomplices
inside the house.

607
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,541
Was there anyone she was
particularly friendly with,

608
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:26,624
anyone on the staff?

609
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,499
I'm sure I couldn't say.

610
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:31,624
I don't listen to tittle-tattle
from belowstairs, I'm afraid.

611
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,624
Oh, no, no, quite.
I didn't mean to suggest --

612
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,666
Oh, excuse me.

613
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,749
I did not know
you were still in here.

614
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,958
No, no, that's fine.
We were just about finished.

615
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,541
-Eh, Miss Collins?
-You're sure?

616
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,791
Oh, yes, thank you.

617
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:47,666
Merci, mademoiselle.

618
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,833
Mm-hmm.

619
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:55,958
Anything?

620
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,333
What about you?

621
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,458
Oh, I learned a lot
from M. Tredwell.

622
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:02,583
And?

623
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,041
There is one thing
I do not understand.

624
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,499
I don't understand any of it.

625
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,249
No, no, no, mon ami,
it is simple, hmm,

626
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:12,749
but for the one thing.

627
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,583
Here is a child, huh,
here in this room,

628
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,708
guarded by his father
and the Inspector Japp.

629
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,249
Now, the false alarm is raised,

630
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,249
and the inspector and Waverly
foolishly rush out,

631
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,791
leaving the child undefended,
yes?

632
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,124
-Yes.
-Bon.

633
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,624
Now, the kidnapper comes in
and takes away the child?

634
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,166
Where?

635
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,083
What do you mean, "where"?

636
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,291
Well, they cannot go
out this way.

637
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,999
Waverly and the inspector
have just gone,

638
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,124
and there are still
the policemen

639
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,083
standing not 20 meters away.

640
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,999
This way, yes.

641
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:57,499
But to what end?

642
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,249
The front of the house has
a policeman outside the door.

643
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,874
The back door, likewise.

644
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,833
Now, that side of the house
is where Rogers has been caught,

645
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,666
and excitement reigns.

646
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,624
Mm-hmm.
A problem, huh?

647
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:17,291
I see what you mean.

648
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,583
The tunnel.

649
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,874
Comment?

650
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,249
The tunnel.

651
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,499
What tunnel?

652
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,499
A lot of Catholic houses
used to have priest holes,

653
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,166
places where the priests
used to escape to

654
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,999
if the king's men came looking
for them.

655
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,583
Where is it, this tunnel?

656
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,083
Sacré.

657
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:45,583
Where does this lead?

658
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:48,791
It comes out at the mausoleum,
about half a mile away.

659
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:50,333
Uh-huh.

660
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:52,999
I need a... lampe de poche.

661
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,583
What is that,
a lamp of the pocket?

662
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,999
-A torch?
-Torch!

663
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,583
Oh, I've got one in the car.

664
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,208
Bon.

665
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,208
Who would know of the existence
of this, M. Waverly?

666
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:04,249
Not easy to say.

667
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,166
A few people who've visited
the house, I suppose,

668
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,999
but mainly just family.

669
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:11,958
I see.
Servants?

670
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,166
One or two of them, I suppose.

671
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,333
Miss Collins?

672
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:16,708
Oh, no, I'm sure not.

673
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:18,833
Tredwell?

674
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,541
Oh, he's bound to, I suppose.

675
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:21,749
He's been with us so long.

676
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,791
Ah.

677
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,124
And the child's nurse --
Mrs. Withers?

678
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,666
I wouldn't have thought so, no.

679
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,541
Here we are -- one each.

680
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:31,166
Good.

681
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,583
Come, Captain Hastings.

682
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:35,791
We embark on a voyage
into darkness.

683
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,166
I'll come with you.

684
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:44,416
No, no, no, no, no, Captain
Hastings and I must go alone.

685
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:47,916
There's some steps going down.

686
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,999
Forward.

687
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,749
Tell me,
what do you make of this case?

688
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:09,249
You don't expect me
to think in the dark, do you?

689
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:11,124
Ah, Hastings,
the little gray cells --

690
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,124
sometimes they work even better
in the dark.

691
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,999
But always we come back
to the same question --

692
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,708
why would anyone warn
the Waverlys

693
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:21,874
before they kidnap a child?

694
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,708
I suppose they hoped to get
the money

695
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,583
without actually being forced
to do it.

696
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,499
But this does not alter the fact

697
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,333
that they were making
a thing difficult

698
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,499
that was perfectly easy.

699
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,708
If they do not specify
a time or date,

700
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,708
nothing would be easier for them
to wait their chance,

701
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,916
carry off the child
in a motor one day

702
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,666
when he is out with his nurse.

703
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:41,041
I suppose so.

704
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,374
I can see a light up ahead.

705
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,541
Good.

706
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,333
I am bored with this tunnel!

707
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,999
Very sweet, very nice.

708
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:23,041
Ah.

709
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,833
See, the car could be waiting
here, well away from the house.

710
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,708
The child could be brought
through the tunnel to the car.

711
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,999
The driver makes the getaway,

712
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,583
hooting as he passes
in sight of there.

713
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:44,333
It is a farce, nothing more.

714
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,874
Everything goes to show

715
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,791
that there was an accomplice
inside the house --

716
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,833
the mysterious poisoning
of Mme. Waverly --

717
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,208
Poisoning?

718
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,458
Ah, my poor Hastings --
so innocent.

719
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,541
No, no, no, no, no, it is nice.

720
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:07,583
But surely you cannot imagine
it was by accident

721
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,249
that Mme. Waverly was
conveniently kept out of the way

722
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:13,166
on the day of the kidnapping.

723
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:14,458
Good God.

724
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:15,874
Point number two --

725
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:19,624
someone in the house
must have pinned the final note

726
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,041
to M. Waverly's pillow.

727
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,416
Yes, I see that.

728
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:23,999
Point number three --

729
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,708
the putting on of the clock
10 minutes, huh?

730
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:29,333
All inside jobs.

731
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,999
Now, we have four people
inside the house.

732
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:35,916
Mme. Waverly and Miss Collins
we can exclude.

733
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,249
The one is --
How you say "au lit," huh?

734
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:41,499
Bedridden, yes?

735
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,958
And the other, Miss Collins,
is with her.

736
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,041
Well, that only leaves
Mr. Waverly and Tredwell.

737
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,416
So it does.

738
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:57,124
Hastings, I've had enough
of this case.

739
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,999
There is a train to London
in 40 minutes.

740
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,166
Well, I'll drive you to London.

741
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,708
No, no, no, Hastings,
I take the train.

742
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,166
Ah.

743
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,791
Where are you going?

744
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,916
Oh, Captain Hastings
is being kind enough

745
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:21,958
to drive me to the station.

746
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:24,083
Thence, I shall proceed
to London.

747
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,708
But the case -- my son.

748
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,916
You haven't done anything.

749
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,166
But I have done everything,
monsieur.

750
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,541
Then where is he?

751
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,333
Ah.

752
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:38,083
I will give you the address.

753
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,499
It's a blank sheet.

754
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,166
Because I am waiting for you
to write it down for me.

755
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:52,458
You will take Captain Hastings
and me to the boy now.

756
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:58,249
If you do not,
Mme. Waverly will be informed

757
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,249
of the exact sequence of events

758
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,583
that made up
this dastardly crime.

759
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:17,541
He's all right.

760
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:20,208
He's well cared for.

761
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,083
Of that I have no doubt.

762
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,708
Jessie?

763
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,416
Daddy?

764
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,999
Daddy!

765
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:15,874
Ah. Johnnie's nurse.

766
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,458
Of course, of course.

767
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,249
You are Mr. Tredwell's daughter.

768
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,624
Niece.

769
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:24,291
Ah.

770
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:45,166
I am sure your ingenuity
will be equal to the task

771
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:48,499
of explaining
the boy's reappearance.

772
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,874
If I did not believe you to be
a good father at heart,

773
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:55,583
I would not be so willing
to give you another chance.

774
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,499
I'll do anything
to avoid a scandal.

775
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:02,208
Precisely.

776
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,333
Appearances are what matter,
huh?

777
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:07,208
That was why it was intolerable

778
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:10,333
that your wife should call
a halt to the restoration work

779
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:11,708
on the house.

780
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,708
Having a rich wife
is not the same

781
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:16,708
as being rich oneself, monsieur.

782
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,791
Don't worry.

783
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:21,833
I've learnt my lesson.

784
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:23,666
Good.

785
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,333
Your name is an old
and honored one.

786
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:31,249
Do not jeopardize it again.

787
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,541
I shall be sending you my bill.

788
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,583
Drive, Captain Hastings.

789
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,124
Won't you let me in
to the secret?

790
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,124
How did you know?

791
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:29,958
It was obvious.

792
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,874
Who sends away the servants,
can write the notes?

793
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,208
Who can drug his wife?

794
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:37,749
Who can put the hands
of the clock forward?

795
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:41,333
Who can establish an alibi for
his faithful retainer Tredwell?

796
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,916
Tredwell has never liked
his mistress Mrs. Waverly,

797
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:53,124
but he is devoted to his master.

798
00:49:55,834 --> 00:49:57,416
There were three of them
in it --

799
00:49:57,542 --> 00:50:00,458
Waverly, Tredwell,
and his niece, Jessie Withers,

800
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:04,124
who gets herself sacked
as noisily as possible

801
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,583
so that she can arrange
the decoy Rogers,

802
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,708
pick up the boy
from the mausoleum,

803
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:13,999
and drive him away to the little
cottage in the woods.

804
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:18,583
It was apparent, Hastings.

805
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:21,541
I shall see you in London.

806
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:27,624
Why won't you let me drive you?

807
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,124
Hastings, the train has
one advantage over the car.

808
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:38,124
He does not often run out
of coal.
