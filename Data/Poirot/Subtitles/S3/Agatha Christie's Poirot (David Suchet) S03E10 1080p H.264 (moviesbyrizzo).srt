1
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,166
The Harlequinade.

2
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,541
Ancestor of
the English pantomime.

3
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,083
Six characters,

4
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,708
garish, grotesque,

5
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,874
first brought to life

6
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,374
three centuries ago
by the clowns and the actors

7
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,291
of the Italian fairgrounds.

8
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,624
Today, mere costumed characters
at a masked ball.

9
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,791
Where now their mystery,
their magic,

10
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,333
their comedy...

11
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,999
their tragedy?

12
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,833
Ready for the party, Uncle?

13
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,541
Well, where's your mask?

14
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,874
It's not midnight yet,
you know, Eustace.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,249
Victory Ball?

16
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:02,291
You'd think the Hun would
remember 1918 as well as we do.

17
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,124
Ah, well, as Coward says,

18
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,291
"What a pity the Hun
prefers fighting to fun."

19
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,874
Oh, what's this?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,791
Oh, Uncle Eustace,
not more for your collection?

21
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:15,333
Magnificent set, isn't it?

22
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:16,916
Just over from Holland.

23
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:19,166
And Mira's holding it for me
till the end of the month.

24
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:20,999
I can guess why
you're telling me.

25
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,374
Your poor uncle doesn't
get 6,000 a year

26
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:25,874
from the Cronshaw Estates,
as you do.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,749
-Eustace, please --
-You know I'm cleaned out

28
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,791
after the figurines.

29
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,791
This is a night
for old triumphs,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,916
not for new quarrels.

31
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,666
Cronshaw.

32
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,499
This is the National Programme.

33
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,874
The time is 7:00.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,874
And now we present a play
by Desmond Havelock Ellis

35
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:00,333
entitled "Deadly Alibi,"

36
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,624
starring Coco Courtney
as Loretta Lampton.

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,666
The late Coco Courtney,
as usual.

38
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,124
Where the hell is she?

39
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,041
Cue them.

40
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,083
Are you expecting Miss Lampton
for dinner tonight, sir?

41
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,041
Yes. She should be arriving
in about half an hour.

42
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,416
I believe that clock
is gaining, sir.

43
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,958
I'm quite aware of that,
thank you.

44
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,291
Will there be any other guests?

45
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,541
No.

46
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,916
Very good, sir.

47
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,208
Good evening, Davis.

48
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,999
I'm afraid I'm a little early.

49
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,124
That's quite all right, miss.

50
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,041
Bloody actresses.

51
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,374
It was such
a fine night, I --

52
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,583
Hey, is that the time?

53
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,958
Approximately.

54
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,874
Of course.
I forgot -- it gains.

55
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,458
Rather fun, really.

56
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,708
You can be early and late
at the same time.

57
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,083
Oh, Letty.

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,499
I wasn't expecting you
till 8:00.

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,874
Sorry.
I never realized.

60
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,124
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,708
I think Captain Hastings was
listening to the weather report

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
to see whether
you'd need an umbrella.

63
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,541
Oh.

64
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,458
This urgent package
just arrived by messenger.

65
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,791
Can I go now?

66
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,791
Yes, of course.

67
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,666
Just one moment --
Miss Lemon!

68
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,624
Ah. I was wondering
where that had got to.

69
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,416
Apparently, we won't need
an umbrella.

70
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,666
Oh, you haven't forgotten,
have you?

71
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,749
The Victory Ball.

72
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,874
You promised
you'd try and make it.

73
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,583
Ackerley was really
looking forward to it.

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,874
-Ackerley is?
-He's with the BBC.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,124
But he's quite a decent chap.
Drives an Alvis.

76
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,416
Well, unfortunately,

77
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,124
I have to rearrange
my stamps in order of size.

78
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,916
Please convey my apologies
to M. Ackerley.

79
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,333
He'll be very disappointed.

80
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,833
He said that meeting you

81
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,708
is the high spot
of his career.

82
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:16,583
Well, that seems reasonable.

83
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,749
It's not much to ask,
Cronshaw.

84
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,041
A thousand should do it.

85
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,999
Eustace, not now.

86
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,624
Later.

87
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,374
And there she is --

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,791
the belle of the ball.

89
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,708
Cronsh.

90
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,333
Cutting it a bit fine,
weren't you, Coco?

91
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,708
I like cutting it fine.
Hello, darling.

92
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,249
Coco, you remember my uncle,
the Honorable Eustace.

93
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,458
Dishonorable, I heard.

94
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,874
Oh, and this is Chris Davidson,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,499
one of Coco's old
acting cronies.

96
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,874
Hello.

97
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,499
Come on, Davidson.

98
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,333
We'd better go
and rescue your wife.

99
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,374
She's out in the taxi

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,499
with a friend of Uncle's,
the infamous Mrs. Mallaby.

101
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,541
Well, about time.

102
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,458
I was beginning to suspect
Miss Courtney

103
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,208
was having a clandestine affair
with Henry Hall.

104
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,624
And his orchestra.

105
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,874
Good evening, Coco.

106
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,624
Getting chilly, isn't it?

107
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,833
All aboard
for the Victory Ball.

108
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,499
They seek him here,
they seek him there.

109
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,999
Those Frenchies seek him
everywhere.

110
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,708
What do you think, Poirot?

111
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,249
Hastings, you look... .

112
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,124
...incomparable.

113
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,374
I still don't think
they'll let you in.

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,541
I thought I made it clear

115
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,208
the Victory Ball
was a costume do.

116
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,166
Hercule Poirot
does not wear costumes.

117
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,208
Everybody does.

118
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,541
The whole idea is to go
as someone famous.

119
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,916
Precisely.

120
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,416
Oh. I see.

121
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,749
-James.
-Arthur.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,791
May I present M. Hercule Poirot?

123
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,333
I'm so delighted
to meet you at last.

124
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,041
The Sheikh of Ackerley,
I presume.

125
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,249
Well, here we are, then.

126
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:13,374
We eat supper first,
don't we, Cronshaw?

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,416
-No, not till half past 9:00.
-Oh.

128
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,166
Couldn't they run to
a doorman in this place?

129
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,583
We're so backward in England,
Mrs. Mallaby.

130
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,124
We still have door handles.

131
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,999
Oh, well, pardon me for living.

132
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,624
Oh! Sloshed already.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,208
Did I hurt you, my dear?

134
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,749
I half expected you
to shatter like a vase.

135
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,958
-Come along, Coco.
-It's all right.

136
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,874
Are you all right, darling?

137
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,874
I was so afraid I wasn't going
to make it here on time,

138
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,166
thanks to the antics
of Coco Courtney.

139
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,833
Oh, speaking of which,
isn't that her up there?

140
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,416
Oh, Lord Cronshaw's party, yes.

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,958
She's talked about nothing
but the costumes

142
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:58,374
all through rehearsals.

143
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,083
They're a reproduction
of the old Italian comedy.

144
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,124
The what?

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,041
Ah, yes,
the Commedia dell'Arte.

146
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,624
Harlequin, the magical sprite

147
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,749
who can become invisible,
and his lover, Columbine.

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,333
Punchinello and Pulcinella,
the grotesques.

149
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:15,583
And, ah, yes, the tragic Pierrot
and Pierrette.

150
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,791
Enchanting.

151
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,333
I thought Lord Cronshaw
was a younger man.

152
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,916
What? Punchinello?

153
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,124
Oh, no, no.

154
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,916
That's his uncle,
the Honorable Eustace Beltaine.

155
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:32,124
He was the one who bought
those rare Meissen figurines

156
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,749
there was
all that publicity about.

157
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,583
Apparently, they provided
the inspiration for the outfits.

158
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,083
That's Cronshaw
in the Harlequin suit.

159
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,166
Oh, yes.

160
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,166
I read in the paper
he's worth an absolute fortune.

161
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,958
And who is that
lighting the cigarette

162
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,374
of Mlle. Courtney?

163
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,833
The Pierrot?
Chris Davidson.

164
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,291
Quite a versatile actor.

165
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,291
And that's his wife talking
to Cronshaw, I assume.

166
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,249
The other lady is
the notorious Mrs. Mallaby.

167
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,541
Ah, yes.

168
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,541
The American widow in search
of a new victim, yes?

169
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,541
They say she stalks
the aristocracy with a net

170
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,874
and a group of beaters.

171
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,833
Oh, you're such a bore.

172
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,666
They make a jolly
crowd, though, don't they?

173
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,874
Yes, indeed.

174
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,874
And now I think it is time
for a little crème de banane.

175
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,916
Thank heavens that's over.

176
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,374
Coco and Cronshaw
are being simply appalling.

177
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,708
Ah, there's that shyster
Van Meer over there.

178
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,333
Eustace, forget it.

179
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,249
He held me
for ransom on the figurines,

180
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,666
and now he wants to do the same
again with that china.

181
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,499
That's the least of
our worries this evening.

182
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,791
I'm going to
corner the blighter

183
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,374
and demand that
he reduces the price.

184
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,749
Eustace!

185
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:22,791
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,166
When Eustace wants something
for his collection,

187
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,374
he does rather...

188
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,458
I want to put an end
to this right now!

189
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,083
For God's sake, shut up.

190
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,124
Coco, where do you
think you're going?

191
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,333
I told you, I've had enough.

192
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,791
Chris, get me a taxi,
would you?

193
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,041
I've got a splitting headache.

194
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,083
Coco.

195
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,541
It's all been decided, Cronsh.

196
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,583
Chris is taking me home.

197
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,041
The hell he is.

198
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,291
You're staying right here!

199
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,583
I am not prepared to have
an argument about it.

200
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,583
Look, why don't we all just sit
down for a moment and cool off?

201
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,624
Cool off?

202
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,499
He's already as cold as
an iceberg,

203
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,666
with me as the Titanic.

204
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,833
What the hell do you think
you're laughing at?

205
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,374
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,999
Coco, people are looking.

207
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,458
Come along.

208
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:05,083
Cronshaw, let's go back inside.

209
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,791
And yet I feel I took
the podium in Josephine.

210
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,749
M. Ackerley, do I understand
that you produced

211
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,708
a play on the radio this evening
following the weather forecast?

212
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,083
Yes.

213
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,208
Tell me -- is not Mlle. Courtney

214
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,124
slightly older than is usual
for the part of the ingenue?

215
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,333
A little, perhaps, but, then,
that's the joy of radio.

216
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,124
The visual appearance
is all in the mind.

217
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,499
It's amazing what we
get away with sometimes.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,208
Good night.

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,291
What's all that about?

220
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,291
It would appear
that Mlle. Courtney

221
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
and her boyfriend,
Lord Cronshaw,

222
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,291
have had a disagreement
of some kind.

223
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,416
Just now I heard her ask
M. Davidson

224
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,458
to escort her home.

225
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:01,499
Well, that's a shame.

226
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,583
She'll miss all the fun.

227
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,166
Well, I wondered
how long it'd be

228
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,833
before something
like that happened.

229
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,374
You are not surprised?

230
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,166
I know actors, M. Poirot.

231
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,249
They never know when to stop.

232
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,458
Well, she has had her moment
of drama for this evening.

233
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,999
Let us hope
it will be sufficient.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,833
He's arrogant, conceited.

235
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,458
What's all this about, Coco?

236
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,208
What exactly did Cronshaw
say to you earlier?

237
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,333
Chris, not now.

238
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,666
Has our taxi arrived yet?

239
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,916
-Your cab is waiting, sir.
-Careful.

240
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,416
Chris?

241
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,708
We need to
have this out here and now.

242
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,374
Look, you're not a poor man.

243
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,624
Surely you can do me
this one favor.

244
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,999
You know I'm desperate.

245
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,999
Thanks for everything, Chris.

246
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,999
I think I can handle it
from here.

247
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,583
It's time Cronsh realized

248
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,791
I'm not one of his
prize racehorses.

249
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,249
Coco, are you sure
you'll manage?

250
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,583
I'm sure.

251
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,499
I'd get back there
if I were you.

252
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,624
That wife of yours may look
like a startled poodle,

253
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,666
but she's no fool.

254
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,791
I'll never make it back
before midnight.

255
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,541
Well, then, you'd better
go home and wait for her.

256
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,916
Good night, Coco.

257
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,291
Sleep tight.

258
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,124
I always do.

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,083
Have a nice evening,
Miss Courtney?

260
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,833
-Oh!
-So sorry.

261
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,333
Oh, thank you.

262
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,416
M. Ackerley, I thank you.

263
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,791
You are very kind.

264
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,166
My pleasure.

265
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,624
Santé.

266
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,958
Cheers.

267
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,083
Are you sure I can't persuade
you to recount some of

268
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,499
your juicier cases
on the radio?

269
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:25,833
Alas, no.

270
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,874
You see, murder --
a real murder --

271
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,916
is not an entertainment.

272
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,708
Look at this place --
people dance, they laugh.

273
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,666
But anywhere, there may be
evil beneath the mask.

274
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:36,833
Pardon me.

275
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,374
I saw you across the room.

276
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,791
Aren't you Hercule Poirot,
the detective?

277
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:43,999
I am indeed, Madame Mallaby.

278
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,416
Ah!

279
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,041
That's amazing.
You worked out my name.

280
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:51,166
I suppose you don't also know
where Lord Cronshaw is.

281
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,333
He's a Harlequin.

282
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,666
He's been in a tizzy
ever since supper.

283
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:55,833
Alas, no.

284
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,208
Oh.

285
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,291
He promised me a turn
on the floor before 12:00.

286
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:04,124
Then, madame, you must not
be disappointed.

287
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,083
My associate, Captain Hastings,
is a dancer consummate.

288
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,333
He would be pleased
to accompany you.

289
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:14,374
My pleasure.

290
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,166
Ah, look, there he is.

291
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,333
Yoo-hoo!
Viscount Cronshaw!

292
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,916
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

293
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:38,249
Of course.

294
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,999
Been stood up, Arthur?

295
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,499
No title, I'm afraid.

296
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,291
My lords,

297
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,916
ladies and gentlemen,
the time for

298
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,333
the unmasking and the victory
celebrations is at hand.

299
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:02,124
Twelve seconds to midnight.

300
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,291
Ten, nine,

301
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,499
eight, seven,

302
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,041
six, five, four,

303
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,458
three, two, one.

304
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,708
Thank you.

305
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,249
Darling, what is it?

306
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,624
What's happened?

307
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,624
Lord Cronshaw's dead.

308
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:56,874
Inspector Japp,
any comment to make?

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,999
Is it true Hercule Poirot
missed the killer?

310
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,791
Tell us the truth, Inspector.

311
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,666
Here's a fine
dish of tea, Poirot.

312
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,041
Peer of the Realm
murdered in cold blood

313
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:10,833
under the noses of 400 revelers.

314
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,208
We'll need the Albert Hall

315
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,333
to gather the suspects
on this one.

316
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,749
Perhaps.

317
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,833
It is one of
the table knives.

318
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,166
Plenty back here.

319
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,291
We'll check for prints,
but I'll lay odds it's clean.

320
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,583
An instrument not
very practical,

321
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,083
but in the right hands...

322
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,249
Ah, we also found this
on the floor.

323
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,874
The Mallaby woman saw him
make some sort of note

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,291
just before he died.

325
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,083
Lowestoft.

326
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,583
Town on the east coast.

327
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,791
Perhaps he was
planning a holiday.

328
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,708
I say, Poirot, look at this.

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,916
Attention, mon ami.

330
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,416
Monogrammed.

331
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,416
"C" for Cronshaw.

332
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:08,208
Very nice.

333
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,499
Idiot!

334
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,583
What is it?

335
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,124
Such foolishness!

336
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,874
Young people must realize that
life is not to be gambled with

337
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,583
like the roulette wheel.

338
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,874
It is nothing less than poison.

339
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,499
Cocaine.

340
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,458
Would that account for his
strange behavior after supper?

341
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:37,083
It's not unusual for addicts
to become moody and troublesome.

342
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,541
He certainly seems to have
put up a fight.

343
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,916
Why do you say that, Hastings?

344
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,458
Hadn't you noticed?

345
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:45,708
His fist.

346
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:48,791
It's still clenched.

347
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,499
C'est ça.

348
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,374
Well, I can't see
how that helps us.

349
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,291
Can you not, Chief Inspector?

350
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,416
Then let me enlighten you
further.

351
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,499
Unless I am very mistaken,

352
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,749
there is something very
important behind this curtain.

353
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,333
Voilà.

354
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,874
Well, it's just an empty recess.

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,749
My point exactly.

356
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,124
One more thing, Chief Inspector.

357
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,416
If I were you, I should find
Mlle. Coco Courtney.

358
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,291
-Why?
-Ask her if

359
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,291
she and Lord Cronshaw
had an argument.

360
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,624
"Murderer eludes
famous detective."

361
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:49,833
Idiot.

362
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,583
It's a very good photo
of Captain Hastings.

363
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,541
Indeed it is, Miss Lemon.

364
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,874
I'm sure no one
will think less of you.

365
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,374
Seen the paper, Poirot?
Jolly good photo of me --

366
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,749
Oh, you've seen it.

367
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,666
I'll go and sort the letters.

368
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,749
I wouldn't take it to heart
if I were you.

369
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,458
No, indeed, Hastings.

370
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,791
For the present,
it suits my purposes.

371
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:11,791
Ah.

372
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,458
This is what interests me.

373
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,874
The obituary?

374
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,249
Listen to this.

375
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:22,124
"The Viscount Cronshaw was
chairman of many charities,

376
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,166
including the Widows
of British Seamen

377
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,291
and the League Against
Drug Addiction."

378
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,416
"He is succeeded
in his title and estates

379
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,791
by his uncle,
the Honorable Eustace Beltaine."

380
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,666
The League Against
Drug Addiction.

381
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,749
That's a bit hypocritical,
isn't it?

382
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,749
You miss my point,
I think, Hastings.

383
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,458
Mr. Poirot.
Chief Inspector Japp.

384
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:47,749
Oh.

385
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,374
Hello?

386
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,416
Ah, Poirot.

387
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,499
We're drawing a blank
at this end, I'm afraid.

388
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,249
Miss Courtney doesn't
answer her phone,

389
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,208
and there's no reply
at her door, either.

390
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,916
I implore you
to be persistent,

391
00:22:59,042 --> 00:22:59,958
Chief Inspector Japp.

392
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:02,666
I am now even more convinced
that Mlle. Courtney

393
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,749
must be located
with all possible speed.

394
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,166
Right.

395
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,333
Mlle. Courtney
is proving elusive.

396
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,291
Probably sleeping the night off.

397
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,708
All of these theatrical types

398
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,624
lie in late if they
haven't a performance.

399
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,291
But she does have
a performance.

400
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,874
They usually perform
the Friday evening play again

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,958
on Saturday morning.

402
00:23:29,084 --> 00:23:31,541
My mother listens to it
during her morning coffee.

403
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:34,083
I do love him
in a way, I suppose,

404
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,708
but it was never quite how I
imagined it was going to be.

405
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,166
I suppose it never is.

406
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,124
But I'm staring at
the clock -- why?

407
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,666
Come, Hastings.

408
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,249
We will make a trip
to Broadcasting House.

409
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,791
Letty, what do you mean?

410
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,124
I mean...

411
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,124
"Hercules Poy-rot."

412
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,624
I'm afraid the variety auditions
are on Tuesdays.

413
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,374
That is fortunate.

414
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,374
I am here on a matter
of murder, madame.

415
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,958
You're the detective
from the newspapers.

416
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,416
Correct.

417
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,291
Don't suppose you want to
miss a second one.

418
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,916
You were never where
you said you were that night,

419
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,999
but here all the time.

420
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,374
I was such an idiot.

421
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:43,791
I never guessed it was
the money you wanted.

422
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,124
Is that what you thought?

423
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,541
Luckily we took
a recorded transcription

424
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,833
of last night's performance
for the archives.

425
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,999
We would have had to ask one of
the girls to double up parts.

426
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,083
Did Mlle. Courtney send to you
a message this morning

427
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,333
to explain her absence?

428
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,708
Not a sausage.

429
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,124
Three minutes to transmission,

430
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,083
she still wasn't
answering her phone,

431
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,333
so I had no choice
but to use the transcription

432
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,708
and dismiss the other actors.

433
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,458
Hastings, I'm very much afraid
of what has happened.

434
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:11,166
Would you please telephone
the Chief Inspector Japp?

435
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,124
Instruct him that he must
enter the apartment

436
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,208
of Mlle. Courtney
by any means necessary.

437
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,249
-Well, of course, but what --
-Hastings, please.

438
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,291
This is a matter
of life and death.

439
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,958
Very clever, Letty,
but I suppose you realize

440
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:23,958
that I can't let you
spill the beans.

441
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,833
Is there anything
I can do to help?

442
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,333
Phillip, you can't!

443
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,624
Fourth floor, lads.

444
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,999
Right, the apartment above.

445
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,416
Get down on the balcony.

446
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:57,791
Fast!

447
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,083
And don't break your necks!

448
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,083
Nothing yet?

449
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,541
You and Mlle. Courtney
are old friends, huh?

450
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:12,916
After a fashion.

451
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,374
She likes having people
she knows around her

452
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,416
playing minor roles.

453
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,083
Coco and I go back a long way.

454
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,583
She was playing the lead in Rep
when I landed my first part.

455
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,499
So you see a great deal
of each other.

456
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,874
Look here, Poirot.

457
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,708
I'm a married man, remember?

458
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,416
I'm sorry, M. Davidson.

459
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,583
Forgive me, but...
I was just trying to ascertain

460
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,124
whether you could shed any light
on the argument last evening

461
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,916
between Mlle. Courtney
and the Lord Cronshaw.

462
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,041
Not really.

463
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,416
There was a bad atmosphere
all evening.

464
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,749
It was as if something
was brewing.

465
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,291
We all noticed it.

466
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,749
But they conversed normally
at supper?

467
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,499
Hardly a word.

468
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,958
No one had much of a chance
to say anything

469
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,541
with Beltaine going on
about some china

470
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,374
he wanted to add
to his collection.

471
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,666
Of course, it all flared up

472
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,041
after the meal,

473
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,666
and then I ended up
taking her home.

474
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,666
And when you were
alone together

475
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,041
in the taxi?

476
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:16,249
Just a lot of nonsense about
how she'd make Cronshaw pay.

477
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,083
The usual hysterics.

478
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,458
And then I dropped her off
at her flat.

479
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,708
At what time was this?

480
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:27,791
Nearly midnight.

481
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,791
There was no time
to go back to the ball,

482
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:30,833
so I just headed home.

483
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,541
Ah.

484
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,374
All right, lower away.

485
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,874
Okay, okay.

486
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,833
Sir.

487
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,124
He made me
feel young again,

488
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,249
like a newborn calf.

489
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,374
When I saw him,

490
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,416
it was as if the whole world
was fresh.

491
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:12,874
We'll come down right away.

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,749
Even the sky seemed bluer.

493
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:24,958
Get up there.
Come on.

494
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,624
Let's see her face.

495
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,958
All right, stop that, you lot.

496
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:35,624
-Courtney!
-Come on.

497
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,666
Try and get another picture.

498
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,083
Come on, move out of the way.

499
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,458
Could you stop for a minute?

500
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,291
Still looking, Poirot?

501
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,833
Poirot,
can you make a statement?

502
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,458
No photographs.
No, no, no.

503
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:57,958
Chief Inspector.

504
00:28:58,084 --> 00:28:59,999
We found her in the bedroom.

505
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:01,499
Overdose of cocaine.

506
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,749
Presumably supplied by her
boyfriend, Lord Cronshaw.

507
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,416
How many more must die

508
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:08,833
before this folly
is seen for what it is?

509
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,208
Toxicity finally
got too much for her.

510
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,333
Cronshaw must have been

511
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,083
supplying it to her
for some time.

512
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,541
Do you not understand,
Chief Inspector?

513
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,958
Lord Cronshaw
was determined to stop

514
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,374
Mlle. Courtney
from taking cocaine.

515
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,749
The initial, "C,"
on the silver case --

516
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,249
it stood for her name, Coco.

517
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,374
Of course.

518
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,749
The quarrel after supper
was when Cronshaw discovered

519
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,291
what he'd suspected
all evening --

520
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,708
that she had a supply with her.

521
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:36,458
He took it from her,
and that's when she went home.

522
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:37,749
So, to spite him,

523
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,291
she took another dose
as soon as she got back.

524
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,666
Messy.

525
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:43,999
What I don't see is where

526
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,958
Cronshaw's murder fits in
with all this.

527
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,541
Because the devil himself
dances among us,

528
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:51,791
but we do not see him.

529
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,999
Eh?

530
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,958
I wonder...

531
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,624
Chief Inspector,

532
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,874
will you permit me a further
examination of the body?

533
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,791
Well, I don't know
what you expect to find.

534
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,833
The facts on Miss Courtney
are indisputable.

535
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,749
I am not talking about the body
of Mlle. Courtney.

536
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:12,499
I am talking about the body
of Lord Cronshaw.

537
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,833
That newspaper headline sent him
dippy, if you ask me.

538
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,874
What's he going to find
that we didn't spot last night?

539
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,708
You checked all his pockets?

540
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,208
Pockets, clothing, the lot.

541
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,249
I don't see --

542
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,333
Indeed you do not see,
Chief Inspector.

543
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,374
All right, Poirot,
what's the trick?

544
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,291
Look at his hand.

545
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,374
What do you observe?

546
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,999
Clenched fist.

547
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,624
Hastings.

548
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,666
I agree.

549
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,416
But the fist --
why is it clenched?

550
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,916
Could it be
that it hides a secret?

551
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:13,666
Voici.

552
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,874
Swat me,
he was holding something.

553
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,249
The pompom.

554
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,458
Mr. Poirot!

555
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:57,833
Ah, Mme. Mallaby.

556
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,541
Captain Hastings.

557
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,499
We meet again.
I wonder, could you --

558
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,874
-Of course.
-Oh!

559
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,249
I couldn't decide
on my autumn look.

560
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,624
Anyway, Eustace can afford it.

561
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:11,166
He's Viscount Cronshaw now.

562
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,499
26 pence.

563
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:16,999
Oh.

564
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,041
To what do we owe
this delegation?

565
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,499
Well, M. Poirot
has taken it into his head

566
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,708
to see these famous figurines.

567
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,249
-Oh.
-A foolish whim.

568
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,624
Is His Highness
at home, Summers?

569
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,416
His... Lordship is in
the morning room, madam.

570
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,374
Thank you.

571
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,041
This way, gang.

572
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:47,708
Summers, be a dear

573
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,416
and take the boxes, will you?

574
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,208
Hi, Eustace.

575
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,916
Ooh, I see you're already
enjoying your inheritance.

576
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,624
It's beautiful.

577
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,874
May as well salvage
some consolation

578
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:01,708
out of this awful business.

579
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,083
-Hmm.
-Ah.

580
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,624
Poirot, Hastings.

581
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,833
Welcome.

582
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,499
Good afternoon, Viscount.

583
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,624
I say, what a quaint
little tea set.

584
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,708
Hastings, this tea set
is not only "quaint,"

585
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:15,666
as you call it, but priceless

586
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:17,916
and very rare, n'est-ce pas?

587
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:21,124
Had no idea you were
interested in china, Poirot.

588
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,624
Mr. Poirot wants
to see the figurines.

589
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:24,999
The Meissens?

590
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,291
Mais oui.

591
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,333
We have all heard
so much about them

592
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,166
and of your success in
bringing them to this country.

593
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,708
I wonder if I could please
make an examination.

594
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:34,833
Feel free.

595
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:36,541
Thank you.

596
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,999
Ah.

597
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,124
May I?

598
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,458
I can't imagine
what he's looking for.

599
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:53,874
Tricks of the trade, you know.

600
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:55,958
The costumes last night

601
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:58,833
at the ball -- they were
exact replicas of these?

602
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,874
To the last detail.

603
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,416
Oh.

604
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,916
And this was your apparel,
was it not?

605
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:08,666
Punchinello,

606
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,874
with the elaborate ruff
and the hump.

607
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,083
Yes.

608
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,499
I imagine it took
some time to change

609
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,166
in and out of this costume.

610
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,833
I had to hold him up
while he unfastened it.

611
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,291
As I thought.

612
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,166
Viscount, where were you

613
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,833
after supper last night
during the ball?

614
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:40,083
Trying to beat down
the dealer chap over this lot.

615
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,083
Finally managed to corner him.

616
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,749
In the supper room?

617
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,333
That's right.

618
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,833
Again, I thank you.

619
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,083
Well, cheerio.

620
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,208
Ah, there you are, Poirot.

621
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,208
I've been looking for you.

622
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:13,999
Chief Inspector Japp.

623
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,624
I've been doing some thinking,

624
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,583
and to my mind,
that missing pompom

625
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,791
could only have come
from one person.

626
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,999
I concur absolutely,
Chief Inspector.

627
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:25,749
Excuse me.

628
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:32,583
Mrs. Davidson?

629
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,958
Yes.

630
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,916
May we come in?

631
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:38,958
Oh, thank you.

632
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,624
I'm sorry my husband isn't here.

633
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,249
He went out for a drink.

634
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,124
A bit early for that
sort of thing, isn't it?

635
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,958
He's the sociable type, is he?

636
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:51,541
Yes.

637
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,958
Unlike me.

638
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,374
Acting isn't exactly
a good, steady job, you know.

639
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:02,083
You're not in
the profession yourself?

640
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,124
No.

641
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,124
I thought I might like to once,
but I just couldn't,

642
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,541
not in front of everyone
like that.

643
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,249
Why, indeed there are many types
of people in this world, madame.

644
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,291
We must each be true
to ourselves.

645
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,833
Perhaps.

646
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:23,124
What exactly did you want?

647
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:24,999
M. Poirot here has some notion

648
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,833
of staging a reconstruction
of the evening.

649
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,458
Oui, that is so.

650
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,124
Oh?

651
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,374
Oh, it is just merely a question
of detail to be checked.

652
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,499
The precise nature
of the costumes

653
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,208
that were made for you
for last night's ball.

654
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:39,249
You understand?

655
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,291
I think so.

656
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:41,874
We'd like to
have a look at them

657
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,999
for a moment, if we may.
Do you still have them?

658
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,374
I'm afraid not.

659
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,749
My husband sent them
to be cleaned.

660
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,583
Yes, of course.

661
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:54,916
Quel dommage.

662
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,374
Well, I'm very sorry to have
disturbed you, Mme. Davidson.

663
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,166
We will just finish our tea.

664
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,124
Thank you, Hastings.

665
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,499
You were right, Mme. Davidson,

666
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,208
not to consider
a career in acting.

667
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,874
Your eyes betrayed
what your tongue denied.

668
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,291
Chief Inspector?

669
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,833
There's a pompom missing
from the Pierrette costume.

670
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,874
Is there?

671
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,999
Perhaps you'd like to tell us

672
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,916
how it came to turn up in
the hand of the murdered man.

673
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,291
Oh, yes, I forgot.

674
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,208
It got pulled off after supper,

675
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,958
and I didn't know
what to do with it.

676
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,749
I looked for Mr. Beltaine,
but he was in the supper room

677
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,666
having some kind of argument,

678
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,958
so I gave it to Lord Cronshaw
to look after.

679
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:55,333
Sorry, I didn't think
it was important.

680
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,291
Does that answer your question?

681
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,708
You must understand,
Mme. Davidson,

682
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:03,333
that to conceal information
may not only protect the guilty,

683
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,249
but also punish the innocent.

684
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,541
You do understand, do you not?

685
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,249
I understand.

686
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,249
I'm sorry.

687
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:18,333
Sunday Standard!

688
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:20,666
Her story seemed
completely plausible.

689
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:21,874
Except in one respect.

690
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,999
-What's that?
-It is a foolish lie.

691
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,083
The threads of the pompom
that we discovered

692
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:28,708
in the hand of
Lord Cronshaw --

693
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,333
they were torn, whereas those

694
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,291
on the costume
of Mme. Davidson were cut.

695
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,958
You mean she cut it off herself?

696
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:34,999
No, no, Hastings.

697
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,208
She did not even notice
that the pompom was missing

698
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,291
until we pointed it out.

699
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,624
That is why she made up
that story that was ridiculous.

700
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,291
Hers was cut by the murderer.

701
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:43,458
Why?

702
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,208
To replace the one
that Lord Cronshaw

703
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,083
had torn from the costume
of his killer.

704
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,916
Well, if it wasn't her,
and her husband

705
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,041
wasn't even there when
Cronshaw was murdered --

706
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,124
Have either of you
considered the possibility

707
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,166
of a duplicate costume?

708
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:55,583
Another Pierrot?

709
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,499
Well, what about that note
he left -- Lowestoft?

710
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,499
Ah, yes, the note.

711
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,916
May I suggest that you inquire

712
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,333
from the dealer
about the dinner service

713
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:08,499
that has just been purchased
by Lord Beltaine?

714
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:11,874
I think you will discover that
it is rare Lowestoft china.

715
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:13,958
You mean --

716
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,624
And now it is necessary
to restore

717
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,541
the reputation
of Hercule Poirot.

718
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:51,333
This is
the National Programme.

719
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:54,541
In a change to our
published schedule,

720
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,083
we now present
a special broadcast.

721
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,166
Good evening, everybody.

722
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,833
This is Hercule Poirot.

723
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:12,374
I have been asked many times to
recount my cases for the radio,

724
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:14,499
but I have always refused.

725
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,124
However, tonight, I have
decided to present for you

726
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,541
a reconstruction of the affair
at the Victory Ball,

727
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,916
and that is why I have with me
tonight in the studio

728
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:29,583
the principal members
of the party

729
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,916
whose lives were altered
by that most tragic event.

730
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,624
I thank you all
very, very much, indeed,

731
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,749
for accepting my invitation.

732
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:42,374
And now, I take you back
to the Colossus Ballroom

733
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,333
on the night
of the Victory Ball.

734
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,291
The lights, they dim.

735
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:52,249
The music, it plays.

736
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,208
And the shadows
of the principal characters

737
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:02,166
return to gather before us.

738
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,999
Listen.

739
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,666
You can almost hear them.

740
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,583
Harlequin am I,

741
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,583
in diamond panes
of colored hue.

742
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,249
And I his Columbine.

743
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,874
Together, we have

744
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,374
special care
for lovers true.

745
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:24,749
Punchinello also
here appears.

746
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:27,416
Bombast and buffoon
to no avail.

747
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,458
Seeking heart

748
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:32,583
of Pulcinella,
ever shall he fail.

749
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,124
Heroes' tragic fate
is saddest.

750
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,499
See his painted tear.

751
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,249
Sighing for
his own Pierrette,

752
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,416
star-crossed lovers.

753
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:46,958
So completes

754
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:51,874
our masqueraders
gathered once more here.

755
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,249
And so our little evocation
is complete.

756
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,583
Our ensemble is before us.

757
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,374
And this, ladies and gentlemen,

758
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,374
I have been told
is the wonder of radio,

759
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,333
because what we see
is in the eye of our mind.

760
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:13,541
What is in the eye
of your mind,

761
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,999
Mme. Mallaby?

762
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,083
Why, the six characters
we heard,

763
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:20,458
of course.

764
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:21,916
Viscount?

765
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,291
Oh, just the same.

766
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,833
The six characters as portrayed

767
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,291
by my figurines, but --

768
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,833
You agree, Mme. Davidson?

769
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:36,083
Of course we agree,
Mr. Poirot.

770
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:37,458
Bon.

771
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:39,833
But now let us see
the reality before us.

772
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:44,208
Messieurs, mesdames,

773
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,083
the players.

774
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,916
Oh.

775
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,124
I present to you
Pierrette, Pierrot,

776
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:55,499
Pulcinella, Punchinello,
and Columbine.

777
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,749
There's one missing.

778
00:42:58,584 --> 00:42:59,833
That's right.

779
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,416
Where's Harlequin?

780
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,749
Have you forgotten, Viscount,

781
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:09,916
that Harlequin
can become invisible?

782
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,958
Let us now reveal the truth.

783
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,583
Are you ready to tell us
the truth,

784
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:23,708
Mme. Davidson,

785
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:27,208
or shall I?

786
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,874
Very well.

787
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,333
It was all very simple.

788
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:37,083
The motive behind the murders

789
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:39,958
of both Lord Cronshaw
and Coco Courtney

790
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,833
was the evil drug cocaine.

791
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:48,333
You're staying right here!

792
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,958
I'm not prepared to have
an argument about it.

793
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:52,499
During the Victory Ball,

794
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,958
I witnessed
an argument between

795
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:55,624
Lord Cronshaw and Mlle. Coco.

796
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,958
They were known to be lovers,

797
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:59,291
but Cronshaw had discovered
Coco's secret addiction.

798
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,374
What the hell do you think
you're laughing at?

799
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,916
: The young Lord Cronshaw
was a man of high principle.

800
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,916
He seized his lover's cocaine
and threatened to

801
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,333
expose the supplier
who was destroying her life

802
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,499
along with many others.

803
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,291
But Coco was now
hopelessly addicted.

804
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,541
By the time she reached home,

805
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,249
she had obtained a new,
fatally strong dose of cocaine

806
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,333
from her supplier,
who now knew

807
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,374
the one chance to avoid prison

808
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:33,083
was murder.

809
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,708
But what of our Harlequin?

810
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,624
When I examined the body
of Lord Cronshaw,

811
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,624
I failed to discover
the pompom.

812
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,458
Why?

813
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:47,708
Because the fist was clenched
tight with the rigor mortis.

814
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:50,041
Lord Cronshaw
was not killed at 12:00.

815
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,124
He was killed earlier
in the evening

816
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,708
and the body hidden in
the recess until later.

817
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:55,833
Voilà.

818
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,166
But that can't be.

819
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,958
I saw him myself
a few moments before midnight.

820
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,374
No, no, no, Mme. Mallaby.

821
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:06,166
The Harlequin that you saw,
that very same Harlequin,

822
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,124
is here with us in this room.

823
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,958
The killer had
a duplicate costume,

824
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,791
and after the murder,
assumed the role of Harlequin,

825
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,874
even scribbling a false clue
pointing to M. Beltaine

826
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:26,833
and his obsession
with the Lowestoft china.

827
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,083
Ridiculous, huh?

828
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:30,666
Since the elaborate costume
of M. Beltaine

829
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,916
cannot be changed
without assistance.

830
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,374
No.

831
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,749
The murder took place
soon after supper,

832
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,249
when the killer contrived

833
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,374
a moment alone
with Lord Cronshaw.

834
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,416
It is Cronshaw
who knows the truth

835
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,749
about the dealing in cocaine.

836
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:50,374
To avoid being exposed
and to preserve

837
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,333
the evil trade in drugs,

838
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,916
the murderer stabs
Lord Cronshaw to death.

839
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,583
At the time,

840
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,916
the killer is unaware that
the last act of Lord Cronshaw

841
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,624
is to pull the pompom
from the costume.

842
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,208
Then the body is hidden
in the alcove

843
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,624
and the plan,
it can be completed.

844
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,166
-Yoo-hoo!
-At last,

845
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:14,208
having alerted Mme. Mallaby
just before midnight,

846
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,249
the final task
was to drag the body

847
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,166
from its hiding place

848
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:19,208
so it would appear

849
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,624
that the murder had only
just been committed.

850
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,791
Twelve seconds to midnight!

851
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,374
Ten, nine,

852
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,124
eight, seven, six,

853
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:31,708
five, four,

854
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,458
three, two, one!

855
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,791
The murderer
then slips quietly away.

856
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,833
Knowing that
when the discovery

857
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,958
of the body occurs,
it is believed

858
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,041
that he is safely at home.

859
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:04,291
No, it couldn't
have been Chris.

860
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,916
But it was, Mme. Davidson.

861
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:08,999
It was your husband who had

862
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,541
a moment alone
with Lord Cronshaw!

863
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,249
It was your husband
who gave to Coco

864
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,666
when they were alone together
in the taxi more cocaine!

865
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:16,583
And, in spite of what
he told us,

866
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,124
it was your husband

867
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,458
who had ample time
to return to the ball

868
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:25,791
to complete his masquerade
as Harlequin.

869
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,916
And still you protect him,

870
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,333
even though you later discovered

871
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,083
that he was implicating you,
his own wife, in the crime

872
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:51,208
by replacing the pompom
that was torn from his costume

873
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:53,958
with the one
he cut from your own.

874
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,666
Don't listen to him, darling.

875
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,874
Congratulations, Mr. Poirot,

876
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:03,249
on a most entertaining piece
of detective fiction.

877
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,416
Mais oui.

878
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,833
I'm afraid that is so.

879
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,458
Half a mo.
What do you mean?

880
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,833
Well, because unless
Mme. Davidson

881
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:15,374
is willing to testify
that her husband deals in drugs,

882
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,916
I'm afraid that everything
that I have told you so far

883
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:19,333
remains only theory.

884
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,374
Then I take it
that the show is over.

885
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,541
Oui.

886
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,958
Unless...

887
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:35,916
Harlequin has one last trick.

888
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,749
Mme. Mallaby.

889
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,916
With which hand did you see
Harlequin writing?

890
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:50,333
Oh, my God.

891
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,541
Cronshaw was right-handed.

892
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,874
Christopher Ian Davidson,

893
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,333
I arrest you for the murders
of Viscount Cronshaw

894
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:03,666
and Miss Coco Courtney.

895
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:13,166
If he had not gone too far
and tried to confuse

896
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,833
by writing a clue
that pointed to Beltaine,

897
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:18,041
he would be walking
away with us now,

898
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:20,333
but as you say,
M. Ackerley, actors --

899
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,333
they never know when to stop.

900
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,124
However, I thank you
very much indeed

901
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,166
for your cooperation.

902
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:27,166
I'm honored that you
took up my invitation.

903
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,083
I'm sure it was a most
enlightening experience

904
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:30,124
for our listeners.

905
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,958
-Thank you.
-Mr. Ackerley?

906
00:49:32,084 --> 00:49:33,874
They've been trying to find you.

907
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:36,916
The switchboard's been flooded
with callers

908
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,583
complaining about
the dreadful accent,

909
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,999
lowering the standard
of spoken English,

910
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,458
all that sort of thing.

911
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:44,791
Oh.

912
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,708
Sir John Reith is waiting
to see you in his office.

913
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:50,833
So sorry.

914
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:55,624
Don't take it too hard, Poirot.

915
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,874
Indeed not.

916
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,416
I am not at all surprised.

917
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,791
-You're not?
-No.

918
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:03,541
Chief Inspector, you really
ought to look to your elocution.

919
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,624
Swat me, there's nothing
wrong with my lingo.

920
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,958
You see, that is exactly
the kind of expression,

921
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:08,999
like "half a mo,"

922
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,833
that brings the language
into disrepute.

923
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,208
Come, Hastings.

924
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,833
I shall lend to
the Chief Inspector

925
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:17,791
my personal copy

926
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:22,666
of "The English
As She Should Be Spoken."

927
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:28,833
Taxi!
