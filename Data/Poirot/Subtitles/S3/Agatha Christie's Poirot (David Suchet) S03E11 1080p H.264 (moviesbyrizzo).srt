1
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,291
Silly old morning,
Uncle Harry.

2
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:45,541
They'll sort you out a loader.

3
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,458
Stoddard.

4
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,708
-Hastings.
-Ah, thank you.

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,749
Hastings?

6
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,666
Now, I shall need at least six.

7
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,083
No, no, no, no, eight,

8
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,874
for the Tetras à l'Hongroise.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,083
I shall ask the hotel
to cook us some tomorrow.

10
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,458
It's not like ordering them
in a shop, Poirot --

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,249
I've got to shoot
the damn things.

12
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,124
I have every faith in your
marksmanship, Hastings.

13
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,916
You ready, old man?

14
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,291
Ah, Roger.

15
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,208
Mr. Poirot, it's taken me
10 years to get him up onto

16
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,624
Uncle Harry's moor -- I don't
want you missing the drive.

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,249
I'm ready.

18
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,999
For God's sake, Harry,
it's not much.

19
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,458
It'll mean I can marry again.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,333
£300 is nothing to you.

21
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,083
Look bloody odd,
wouldn't it, Jack?

22
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,791
Me putting that sort of money

23
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,666
the way of my maid
and my gamekeeper?

24
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,041
Damn you!

25
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,541
I sometimes wonder which of us
was born a bastard.

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,874
Jack?

27
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:49,916
Stoddard.

28
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,291
Yes, Mr. Roger.

29
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,208
Look after Mr. Archie, will you?

30
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,083
Aye-aye, sir.

31
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,624
Right, Mr. Archie,
let's have a look here.

32
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,791
Now, what do you think?

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,833
Good luck, darling.

34
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,833
Mm.

35
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,458
-Bonne chance, mon ami.
-Thanks, old man.

36
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,208
Good shooting, Archie.

37
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,124
Thanks, eh.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,499
Poor old Archie.

39
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,208
Hasn't a clue, I'm afraid.

40
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,749
He's your cousin, isn't he?

41
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,708
Yes. You've seen the guns
he turned up with?

42
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,583
Still, he's only
a schoolteacher,

43
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,124
so on his salary,
what could you expect?

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,041
Now, this is you, old man.

45
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,708
-Good shooting.
-Thanks.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,249
Into your shoulder, tight.

47
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,041
Stroke the cheek,
stroke the cheek, tight,

48
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,499
right, 90° angle.

49
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,624
Now, break!

50
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,874
Well, let's hope for a good bag.

51
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,374
They're breaking, Mr. Pace.

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,999
Here they come.

53
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,791
Damn it.

54
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,791
M. Poirot?

55
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,458
-M. Poirot?
-Oh!

56
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:20,541
Pardon, madame.

57
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,291
The popping, you know.

58
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,999
Why did you come, M. Poirot?

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,208
The red grouse,
it must be eaten fresh,

60
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,166
while the gun is still smoking,
as we say.

61
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,291
Ah, a gourmet?

62
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,208
You are too kind, Mme. Havering,

63
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,666
but it is most rare
in my country, the tetras.

64
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,166
We make do with la gelinotte,
the wood grouse,

65
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,833
with a flavor -- it is piney.

66
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,791
Piney?

67
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,374
Yes, this is
not a word, "piney"?

68
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,124
Like -- Like a pine tree?

69
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,541
Oh, "piney."

70
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,666
Yes!

71
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,999
It's a very good word.

72
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,166
Here we are, sir.

73
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,499
Let's load, quick.

74
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,249
Watch him, Stoddard!

75
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,583
Ah!

76
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,458
You've hit Mr. Pace!

77
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:22,833
Mr. Pace!

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,124
You bloody fool!

79
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,624
You bloody, bloody fool!

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,916
You damn near killed me!

81
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,333
And what the hell
were you doing, Stoddard!

82
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,874
You were supposed to be
looking after him!

83
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:43,208
Call yourself a gamekeeper?

84
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,791
You can't even pass muster
as a nursery maid!

85
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,749
Argh! Will you give me
a handkerchief?

86
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,791
Mr. Archie is a complete idiot.

87
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,333
It looks like
Uncle Harry is all right.

88
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,124
Well, I'd better get back to
Hunter's Lodge --

89
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,833
make sure Mrs. Middleton

90
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,291
has everything under control
for lunch.

91
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:14,916
She's only with us pro tem.

92
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,916
M. Poirot,

93
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,833
may I entrust you with a task?

94
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:23,416
Madame?

95
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,291
Look after cousin Archie
for me, will you?

96
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,666
I couldn't bear it

97
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,124
if he went back to his little
cottage and brooded.

98
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,708
He will not be able to brood

99
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,208
in the company of
Hercule Poirot, madame.

100
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:36,708
You are a treasure.

101
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,124
Oh.

102
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,583
Ellie, where's Mrs. Middleton?

103
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,208
Up in her room, mum.

104
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:13,249
She done most of it.

105
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,124
She left us a note
to get on setting it out.

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,749
She's impossible.

107
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,291
Still, it all looks very nice.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,833
-Thank you, mum.
-Thank you, mum.

109
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,791
I'm going to lie down
for a moment.

110
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,291
I've got a wretched earache.

111
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,083
The wind up there
is like a knife.

112
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,624
It's been snowing
up on the moor, you know.

113
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,458
Others will be here
in about half an hour.

114
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,666
Mrs. Middleton?

115
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,458
For two hours, I am
waiting in the snow, Hastings!

116
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,708
The ice, it is
forming on my bones!

117
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,833
Ah, a log fire --

118
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,833
one of the better provisions
of the English.

119
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,041
Roger was saying

120
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,374
you keep an eye on the place
for the family.

121
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,583
Yes, I'm local -- the poor
relation that's available.

122
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:27,208
Damned invidious it is, too.

123
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,583
What is?

124
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,374
Some of my pupils' families live
six to a room.

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,791
This place lies empty
40 weeks of the year.

126
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,874
They only come up here
for the shooting.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,166
Mrs. Middleton, where's my wife,
do you know?

128
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,416
-She's up in her room, sir.
-Her room?

129
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,083
She has an earache,
sir, I'm told.

130
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,791
Well, she damn well
ought to be here.

131
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,124
That sort of thing
won't get him very far,

132
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:50,708
not with Zoe.

133
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,958
Will you have
some more punch, girls?

134
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,458
Thank you, Mr. Payne.

135
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,999
Ah -- excuse me.

136
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,749
Uncle Harry, I'm really sorry
about your hand.

137
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,416
Don't think I'll take up
grouse shooting as a career.

138
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,916
Delighted to hear it.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,874
A fellow asked me
the other day --

140
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,291
a Bolshie, you know --
asked me,

141
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,999
had I actually made anything
during my workless life.

142
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,958
"Certainly," I said.

143
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,208
"I made a lot of friends,
I made a lot of enemies,

144
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,083
and I've made a lot of money."

145
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,541
You all right, Poirot?

146
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,124
My feet, Hastings,

147
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,666
are still blocks of ice,

148
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,999
my lungs, they are full of
the gunpowder on the fresh air,

149
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,791
and my ears are
full of the popping,

150
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:41,999
and I am ill.

151
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,208
No, I am not all right,
Hastings.

152
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,583
Not at all.

153
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,333
Um, au revoir, M. Poirot.

154
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,291
Au revoir.

155
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,916
-Good to have met you.
-Thank you.

156
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,041
I have to be off.

157
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,541
It's a six-mile bike ride
for me, I'm afraid.

158
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:54,916
You are leaving?

159
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:57,833
One can leave?

160
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,749
Mr. Poirot, goodbye.

161
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,666
Ah, M. Havering,

162
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,124
goodbye, thank you.

163
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,458
Next year, we'll put you up
at the house.

164
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,624
No, the hotel's fine.
It's very comfortable.

165
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,458
-Bye, Roger.
-Goodbye.

166
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,624
Cheerio, thanks.

167
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,124
Hope his hand gets better.

168
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,958
I'm sure it will.

169
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,249
Bye, Archie. Take care.

170
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:21,958
Oh!

171
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:23,333
Oh, I'm sorry!

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,749
It's all right.
I'm all right.

173
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,249
Are you all right, Zoe?

174
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,041
Oh, yes, I had a filthy earache.
I'm fine now.

175
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,416
Take care of yourself, Archie.

176
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,499
Yes... yes, indeed.

177
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,124
Well, uh...

178
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,999
Bye, then.

179
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,208
I'll get myself ready,
then I'll be off to London.

180
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,749
I should make the 5:00.

181
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,416
Darling, couldn't
you catch the 6:15?

182
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,916
-Why?
-Mrs. Middleton wants to go

183
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,124
down to Stoddard's place
to pick up some game.

184
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,499
Oh, darling.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,291
She makes such a fuss.

186
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,333
Bloody temporary staff.

187
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,833
Don't know what that agency's
playing at.

188
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,541
Ellie has to walk four miles,

189
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,041
and you never hear
her complaining.

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,874
It would be so much easier
if you gave her a lift.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,458
She'd only have to walk back.

192
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,458
All right, all right,
I'll do it.

193
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,791
Mrs. Middleton?

194
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,291
Joan, would you like
a lift, too?

195
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,749
Mr. Havering could drop you off
on the way to Mr. Stoddard's.

196
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,958
Oh, thank you, mum.

197
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,624
Come along, then.

198
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm sorry
you didn't enjoy it, Poirot.

199
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,749
My enjoyment is yet to come,
Hastings.

200
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,208
I have given to the chef
his instructions.

201
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,583
What's that?

202
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,166
Mon Dieu.
Look at this, Hastings!

203
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,999
I am a corpse waiting to die.

204
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,624
I shall not survive to enjoy
my Tetras à l’Hongroise.

205
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,916
All aboard!

206
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,374
It's the 6:15 going to all
stations to London King's Cross.

207
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,666
Now, you stay there.

208
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,624
You stay.

209
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,458
Hey, that's my bike!

210
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,124
Mr. Stoddard!
Mr. Stoddard!

211
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,749
Fetch the police.
There's been a shooting.

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,958
Go!

213
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:35,499
And you can confirm that
this is Mr. Harrington Pace?

214
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,708
Yes, sir.

215
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,374
Mrs. Havering's in
a terrible state.

216
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,958
I've given her something
to help her sleep.

217
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,833
I let the killer in --
that's what I can't get over.

218
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,666
Describe this man.

219
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,291
He was wearing a big overcoat,

220
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,749
and he had a beard --
a great, bushy thing.

221
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,083
He said he wanted
to see Mr. Pace,

222
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,791
so I showed him into
the gun room

223
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,416
like I always do
with visitors.

224
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,791
Yes?

225
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:03,374
I went back
into the living room

226
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,041
and started clearing up,
and then heard the sound.

227
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,416
The shot.

228
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:13,083
Like someone knocking on
the door of hell, it was.

229
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,666
Who is it?

230
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,874
It's me.

231
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,499
Come in, Hastings.

232
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,458
There's been a murder.

233
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,791
Who has been murdered?

234
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
Harrington Pace,
up at Hunter's Lodge,

235
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,458
shot with one of
his own revolvers.

236
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,874
Mon Dieu!

237
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,208
Oh!

238
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,208
You're still not well, Poirot.

239
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,583
Oh, I must confess,
I feel a little weak.

240
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,041
You get back into bed now.

241
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,749
You can leave this to me.

242
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,749
-Comment?
-This investigation.

243
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,124
You can leave it to me.

244
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
I'll report back to you,
of course.

245
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,583
I know these people, Poirot,

246
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:10,958
and I've got
one or two ideas already.

247
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,999
What are these ideas, Hastings?

248
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,416
You just relax.

249
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,083
Hastings, will you please stop
tapping your nose

250
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,624
in that theatrical manner,

251
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,124
and tell me all that you know?

252
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,083
I don't seem to be able to find
that Mrs. Middleton, Sarge.

253
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,208
What do you mean,
"can't find her"?

254
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,833
Oh, this is
the Scotland Yard fellow.

255
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,749
Find her!

256
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,624
Right ho, Sarge.

257
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,541
Japp, Scotland Yard.

258
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,374
Sergeant Forgan, Ashby Pickard.

259
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,166
Pleasant drive, sir?

260
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,749
Are you trying to be funny?

261
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,124
No, sir.

262
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,041
Rich, was he, the victim?

263
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,666
Oh, yes, sir,
Harrington Pace --

264
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,291
owned a stud outside
Newmarket,

265
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,041
a house in Belgravia,
and mooring in Monte Carlo.

266
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,666
And who stands to benefit?

267
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,541
Practically all of it goes to
his nephew, Roger Havering.

268
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,916
And where is he?

269
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:19,333
Spent the night at
his club in London.

270
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,208
Yeah, we phoned him there.

271
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,999
He's coming back
on the first train, sir.

272
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,708
He was shot by a man
who just turned up at the door

273
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:31,916
asking to see him.

274
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,291
Must have got away
through that window.

275
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:35,499
Hmm.

276
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,916
It was the gamekeeper
who came and got us.

277
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,708
Oh, he stood to gain, too, sir.

278
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,083
He's the only other
real beneficiary.

279
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,541
-Oh, yes?
-Pace left him £4,000.

280
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,874
Did he, by God?

281
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:49,041
Excuse me, Sergeant,
but she's not on the premises.

282
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,666
She's definitely gone.

283
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,041
Who's that?

284
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,083
The housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton.

285
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,666
She showed the killer
into the house.

286
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,374
She's our chief witness.

287
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,874
Better initiate a search.
How many men have you got?

288
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,249
Men, sir?

289
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,083
Just the one, sir -- him.

290
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,541
Well, you'll have to make
optimum use of your resources,

291
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,916
won't you?

292
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,833
Sir.

293
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,958
Roger, what a terrible thing.
I'm awfully sorry.

294
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,166
Thank you. I must go straight
to the lodge. Zoe needs me.

295
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,916
I think we ought to pop in
and see Poirot on the way.

296
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,666
He's feeling a bit poorly,
so I'm handling the case,

297
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,499
but we must keep him informed.

298
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,624
I am profoundly ill,
as you can see, but...

299
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,249
-I will do my best to assist.
-Thank you.

300
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,041
Uh, one thing, M. Havering,

301
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,416
-if you please.
-Yes?

302
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:03,624
Pardon, but what were you doing
when your uncle was killed?

303
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,708
Oh, it's all right.
Roger was on his way to London.

304
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,374
I spent the night at my club.

305
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:09,458
Police rang me there.

306
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,374
It's a horrible business.

307
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,041
You went to London by train?

308
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,124
Yes, I caught the 6:15.

309
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,791
You talk to anyone
on that train?

310
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,166
No.

311
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,666
You arrived at your club
at what time?

312
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,458
Oh, about 10:00 --
Actually, it was a bit later,

313
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,583
I walked down from King's Cross.

314
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,583
Ah, that's fine.
Thank you.

315
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,124
Hastings?

316
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,583
We'll get on up
to the lodge, Poirot.

317
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:39,874
Very well, Hastings.

318
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,499
Hello, reception desk.

319
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,208
Hello, yes,
this is Hercule Poirot,

320
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:03,583
room number 5,

321
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,166
I require, if you please,
a railway timetable.

322
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,333
I was in here with Mr. Pace

323
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,916
when there was
a knock at the door.

324
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,666
I heard Mrs. Middleton
go to answer it,

325
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,249
so I got up to see who it was.

326
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,666
Yes.

327
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:24,666
It was a man I didn't recognize,
so I waited for Mrs. Middleton

328
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,374
to show him into the gun room
and come and announce him.

329
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,291
What did he look like?

330
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,791
Average-ish height, hat,

331
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,666
specs, I think.

332
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,041
I couldn't be sure.

333
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,374
Beard.

334
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,749
What sort of beard?

335
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,416
Bushy.

336
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,833
He looked like
one of those anarchists

337
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,874
in a cartoon in "Punch."

338
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:51,541
Do you remember what time
this man arrived?

339
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,083
About a quarter to 7:00.

340
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,374
Please go on.

341
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,416
Well, Mrs. Middleton
knocked a minute later,

342
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,249
said the man
wouldn't give his name,

343
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,291
but wanted to see Mr. Pace.

344
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,708
Harry said

345
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,458
he'd see what he wanted.

346
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,166
He got up, and a few minutes
later, we heard the shot.

347
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,666
The housekeeper,

348
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,374
Mrs. Middleton, she was
in the room with you, was she?

349
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,916
Yes, she was clearing
the drinks glasses.

350
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,666
Did this man arrive by car?

351
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:28,333
I don't know.
I didn't hear anything.

352
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,874
Would you normally
hear a car arriving?

353
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,249
Oh, yes.

354
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:38,374
Yes, if he came by car, he
didn't bring it up to the house.

355
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,583
You carry on here.

356
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,208
Yes, sir.

357
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,249
This hotel of yours
presentable, is it?

358
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,624
Not too bad.

359
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,249
I'll book myself in.
What are their sandwiches like?

360
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,874
Sandwiches?
No idea.

361
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,333
Tell you what, I put my money
on this Middleton woman

362
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:04,958
being in league
with the killer.

363
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,166
On her own admission,
she shows the fellow in.

364
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,666
The next morning, she's gone.

365
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,124
Yeah, but she's the only person

366
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,958
who's had a proper look
at the killer.

367
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:13,791
What if she saw through
his disguise?

368
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:14,999
Disguise?

369
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,374
What disguise?

370
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,166
Bushy beard and glasses?

371
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:25,333
And suppose she saw who it was
under the disguise.

372
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:29,833
Perhaps we better start looking
for another body, not a witness.

373
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,124
Well, Mr. Poirot,
you get that down you,

374
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,999
and I reckon you'll live
to fight another day.

375
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,666
Oh.

376
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,124
Thank you very much,
Mr. Anstruther.

377
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,916
Come in.

378
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,124
Ah, Chief Inspector Japp.

379
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,041
Hastings, this is Mr. Anstruther

380
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,916
of the London, Midland,
and Scottish Railway.

381
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,458
Afternoon, gents.

382
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,166
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back.

383
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:07,416
A railway don't run itself,
you know.

384
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:08,916
I'll drop in tomorrow

385
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,499
with some more blackberry tea.

386
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,916
Thank you very much.

387
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,291
Oh, and don't forget
my bike, will you?

388
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,541
Certainly not.

389
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,083
That bike means a lot to me,
that bike does.

390
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,958
Man and boy, I've had that bike.

391
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,791
Au revoir.

392
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,499
Pauvre Mr. Anstruther.

393
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,999
He is a man obsessed.

394
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,791
Obsessed with what?

395
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,499
His bike?

396
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,333
Yes, indeed, Chief Inspector.

397
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,708
It has been stolen.

398
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,208
He is also obsessed
with other things.

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,499
He knows every final detail

400
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,541
about the movements
of the trains

401
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,624
in and out of
his little station.

402
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,708
Oh, yes? Been doing some
investigation, have we?

403
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:50,041
How can I, Chief Inspector?
I am prostrated.

404
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:53,041
I toy with the little lines
of inquiry, that is all.

405
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,874
You, of course,
will be well ahead of me.

406
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,249
Well, we've got a description
of the murderer.

407
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:04,124
Yes, a man of medium height
wearing a broad-brimmed hat,

408
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,166
sporting a beard
that is large and fluffy.

409
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,583
How did you know that?

410
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,166
That is a description of the man

411
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,083
who stole the bicycle
of M. Anstruther.

412
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,624
It is essential
that we find it, Hastings.

413
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,666
Oh, right.

414
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,124
Find what?

415
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,249
The bicycle!

416
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:22,916
Also, I am most anxious

417
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,124
to establish whether or not

418
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,041
M. Archie Havering had an alibi

419
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:29,499
for the time
that M. Pace was shot.

420
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,291
You didn't really like
your uncle, did you?

421
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,833
What are you implying?

422
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,624
Look, I'm sorry about this.

423
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,666
I'm afraid I have to ask you.

424
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,999
Poirot wants to know what
you were doing yesterday evening

425
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,541
at the time of
your uncle's death.

426
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,249
How dare you?

427
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,458
What on earth makes you think

428
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,916
I'd want to kill a man
like my Uncle Harry?

429
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,249
I tell you,
he was beneath contempt.

430
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,958
Mean and selfish.

431
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,499
You know Stoddard the gamekeeper
is his half-brother,

432
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,374
one of his father's bastards.

433
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,499
Good lord!

434
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,166
His own blood,
and he used him like a servant.

435
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,833
How did he get his money
in the first place?

436
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:14,958
I'll tell you.

437
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,874
He cheated his partner
in County Mayo,

438
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,374
then used the money
for profiteering on the war.

439
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,958
And people liked him!

440
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,208
He boasted about it,
and people applauded!

441
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,624
Clear off!

442
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,541
Hello?

443
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,333
Chief Inspector?

444
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,124
Ah, how's the cold, Poirot?

445
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,833
It is not a cold.
It is a deadly fever!

446
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,499
Hmm, nasty.

447
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:10,208
However, I have asked
M. and Mme. Havering

448
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,749
to come to the hotel.

449
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,458
I am now convinced
that M. Roger Havering

450
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,708
has not been telling the truth.

451
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,541
You say, M. Havering,

452
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,499
that you arrived at London
at 9:00.

453
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,999
The only witness
that you can produce

454
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:27,208
is the doorman at your club
where you arrived at 10:00.

455
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,083
You say that you spent this hour

456
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,708
walking between King's Cross
at St. James', and yet,

457
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,458
you can describe
none of your movements,

458
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:38,124
no events, no street names,
rien -- nothing.

459
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,249
This isn't the line I've been
following at all, Poirot.

460
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,624
What are you driving at?

461
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,999
I am driving at

462
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,374
a curve in the line
of the local railway.

463
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,874
A loop of iron
which connects Ashby Pickard

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,374
with the little station
of Ashby le Walken.

465
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,749
What?

466
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,624
It is quite possible,
M. Havering,

467
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,791
for a man to catch
the 6:15 train at one station

468
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,166
and get off at the next.

469
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,583
With the aid of a bicycle,
he returns to Hunter's Lodge

470
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:02,708
disguised with a beard

471
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,499
and wearing
a broad-brimmed hat.

472
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,708
He shoots the man
he wishes to shoot.

473
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:08,874
Then he catches the 7:20
from Ashby Pickard,

474
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,749
a train that is
faster than the 6:15,

475
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,708
which will get him to London in
time to be at his club by 10:00.

476
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,916
My God.
You're serious, aren't you?

477
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,666
It is a serious affair!

478
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,749
A man has been killed

479
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,208
and you are about to be
accused of his murder.

480
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,499
Me?

481
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,874
You, sir.

482
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,666
Do you not see it, monsieur?

483
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:31,166
You must tell us of your
movements that night.

484
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,374
Absolutely not.

485
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,041
I can't.

486
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,999
For God's sake, Roger, why not?

487
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,166
I just can't.

488
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,916
Well, Poirot?

489
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,333
Carry on, Chief Inspector.

490
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,833
I would like you to accompany me

491
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,458
to the local police station,
sir.

492
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:51,833
What?

493
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:55,041
I wish to question you in
connection with the murder

494
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,208
of your uncle,
Mr. Harrington Pace,

495
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:00,999
and with the disappearance of
the housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton.

496
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:10,166
Yes? It's for you,
Chief Inspector.

497
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:16,291
Japp.

498
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,124
Right.

499
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,749
What is it?

500
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,999
They found Mrs. Middleton.

501
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,249
We're not late, are we?

502
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,124
No, she hasn't arrived yet.

503
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,041
Shouldn't you be in bed?

504
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,458
Possibly,
but, please, do not fuss.

505
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,541
You looked like you were
at death's door last night.

506
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,124
Unfortunately, Chief Inspector,

507
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,124
it was my appetite
that was dead.

508
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:12,874
My Tetras à l’Hongroise,
it was fed to the cat.

509
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,166
Mrs. Middleton?

510
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,458
Yes, I'm Mrs. Middleton.

511
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,374
Well, what have you
brought me here for?

512
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,124
The instructions from the agency

513
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,708
were to go to Ashby Pickard
by train and I'd be met there,

514
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,041
and the engagement
would be for one month.

515
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,416
So, I did.

516
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,583
And I was met by a very nice
Irish lady who --

517
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,874
Irish? You sure?

518
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,458
Oh, yes!
She said she was Mrs. Pace.

519
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,458
And she said there'd been
an embarrassing mix-up.

520
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,666
What sort of mix-up?

521
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,416
She said they were
canceling the shooting this year

522
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,791
and there was no household
for me to keep.

523
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:11,124
So, anyway, she said
she'd be grateful

524
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,833
if I didn't say anything
to the agency

525
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,166
because she didn't want them

526
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,666
to think she was unreliable,
you know?

527
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:20,749
And she was very generous.

528
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,083
She said she'd give me
two months' wages in lieu

529
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,291
if I'd agree not to put myself
back on the agency books

530
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,666
for a full month.

531
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,166
And you agreed?

532
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,874
Yes!
She seemed very nice.

533
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,999
You kept very quiet
through all that.

534
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:45,958
I am unwell --
and it changes everything,

535
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:47,999
this testimony
of Mme. Middleton.

536
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,208
Well, it all seems
pretty straightforward to me.

537
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:51,999
We still have to find
this other woman

538
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,583
who pretended to be
a housekeeper.

539
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:54,958
Agreed?

540
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,249
I think it would be
more fruitful

541
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,499
to find the bicycle
of M. Anstruther.

542
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,083
What on earth for?

543
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,083
Because, Hastings,
it was stolen

544
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,291
to transport a murderer
to Hunter's Lodge.

545
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,916
Why has it disappeared?

546
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,499
Sir, sir?

547
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,874
What is it, Forgan?

548
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,458
It's Mr. Havering, sir.

549
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,416
He's asking to see you.

550
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,833
I'll tell you what I was doing
if you promise not to tell Zoe.

551
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,791
Well, let's hope
it won't be necessary.

552
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,374
I'll make no promises.

553
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,916
Very well, then.

554
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,249
I was with Lord Quamby.

555
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,708
Lord Quamby?
The racing earl?

556
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,874
Yes, he's chairman of the board
in charge of on course betting.

557
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,916
I wanted him to get me
off the hook.

558
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,666
Well, buy me some time
on a couple of my debts.

559
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,083
Why were you so reluctant
to tell us this?

560
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:44,458
A few months ago, you see,
I promised Zoe

561
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,708
that I'd never back another
horse as long as I lived.

562
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,708
And will Lord Quamby
verify that you were with him?

563
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,291
Of course he will.

564
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:02,208
Tell me, Mlle. Joan,
on the night of the murder,

565
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,833
when was the last time
that you saw Mme. Middleton?

566
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,916
She was in the car
with Mr. Havering

567
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,833
when they dropped me off
at home.

568
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,749
He was on his way
to the station,

569
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,624
and he gave her a lift
over to Mr. Stoddard's house.

570
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,124
Mr. Stoddard the gamekeeper?

571
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,499
Yes, sir.

572
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,583
Ah, yes, of course,
M. Stoddard.

573
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,333
You hope to be his wife one day,
do you not?

574
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,458
No one's supposed to
know that, sir.

575
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,999
I comprehend.

576
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,833
Tell me more about
Mme. Middleton.

577
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,166
Oh, she was that strict.

578
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:38,708
Always leaving little notes
about the place, criticizing.

579
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,458
Mr. Stoddard didn't like her.

580
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,374
They used to be
quite sharp with each other.

581
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:48,958
Did Mme. Middleton ever talk
to you about herself?

582
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,624
No, not really.

583
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:53,041
She said she were from Ireland.

584
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,624
Mayo, I think.

585
00:35:56,417 --> 00:36:00,333
She always kept herself
to herself, like.

586
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,749
Mlle. Joan, this apron?

587
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,624
Oh, that's
Mrs. Middleton's, sir.

588
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,541
Oh. Thank you.
That will be all.

589
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:16,958
So, when Harrington Pace
was living in Ireland,

590
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:19,541
he cheated his partner
and ruined him.

591
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:23,166
Then this mysterious woman,
who was also from County Mayo,

592
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,124
turns up
and replaces Mrs. Middleton.

593
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,083
She was probably a relation
of the ruined man.

594
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,333
She opens the door
to her accomplice,

595
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,208
the fellow with the bushy beard,

596
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,791
they kill Pace,
and both of them disappear.

597
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:38,291
Absolument, mon ami.

598
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,874
You have the story exact.

599
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,249
Oh.

600
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,291
In your
hunt countries, of course,

601
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,124
they use your gazehound,

602
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,708
hunts by sight.

603
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,666
For the moistness in our air,

604
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,833
we favor a dog
that hunts by scent.

605
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:03,541
And I tell you,

606
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,999
she's a prime example of that,
aren't you, huh?

607
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,583
She's the best of her kind,
she is.

608
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,333
That is most interesting.

609
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,833
Tell me, M. Stoddard,
if you please,

610
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,999
on the night
that M. Pace was killed,

611
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,916
Mme. Middleton
came to your house

612
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,041
to collect some game birds,
did she not?

613
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:24,416
No.

614
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,333
Oh, you're right.
I was expecting her,

615
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,499
but she never arrived.

616
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,416
I didn't see her
till much later,

617
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,791
when she came running down lane
to tell me about the shooting.

618
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,458
Chief Inspector,
there is at Hunter's Lodge

619
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,874
a telephone, is there not?

620
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,249
Yes, there is.

621
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,791
Then why did not
Mme. Middleton herself

622
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:48,624
telephone to the police?

623
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,999
Aye, it crossed my mind then.

624
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,541
What she said was

625
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,333
that Mrs. Havering was near
hysterical at the horror of it.

626
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:01,208
She wanted to get her to sleep
before the police got there,

627
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,083
so she sent me to fetch them.

628
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,749
Ah, yes, she needed the time
alone in the house.

629
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,541
Yes, of course, of course.

630
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,666
M. Stoddard,

631
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,999
would you consider to involve
your excellent dog

632
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,583
in a little experiment?

633
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,791
She is clever with her nose,
you say?

634
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,791
She's got a nose that would

635
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,708
scent a poppy in
a bit of slurry, she has.

636
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:32,833
Eh bien, M. Stoddard,
our poppy, it is in here.

637
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,666
It is essential
that we determine

638
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,583
the whereabouts of the person

639
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,833
who calls herself
Mme. Middleton.

640
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:46,166
Easier said than done.
Not a glimmer.

641
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,374
Road, rail, local gossip,
nothing.

642
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,999
-That's why I think --
-Eh-up, eh-up!

643
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,083
What's it, girl?

644
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,749
What's the matter, girl, huh?

645
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,249
What's it, girl, huh?

646
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,083
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

647
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,749
So it's been buried?

648
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:05,916
Some thing.

649
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,208
It's a coat.

650
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,958
And a hat.

651
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,291
Hey, look at this.

652
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:34,833
Swipe me.

653
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,666
Bon! M. Anstruther,
he will be most pleased.

654
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:46,708
What a clever dog.

655
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,458
Everyone here?

656
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,416
In the gun room, sir.

657
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,791
M. Harrington Pace
was not a likeable man.

658
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,374
He used his wealth to control
his friends and his family.

659
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:55,249
For example, M. Stoddard,
his unacknowledged brother,

660
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,708
he employed as a gamekeeper,

661
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:00,333
but refused to lend him
the £300 necessary

662
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,708
to purchase his house
and to get married.

663
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,916
His nephew, M. Archie Havering,

664
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,333
he used as an estate manager,

665
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:14,333
paying him not with money,
but with promises of a legacy.

666
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:16,458
His other nephew,
M. Roger Havering,

667
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,708
was also made to dance
the attendance

668
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,083
by assurances of wealth to come.

669
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,999
There are, I think, here
motives for murder.

670
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,333
N'est-ce pas?

671
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,333
Now, look here, Poirot --

672
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:31,166
No, no, no, please, M. Roger,

673
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:34,041
I make not the accusations.
I merely speculate.

674
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,833
For instance, we know that

675
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:38,666
you could not have possibly
committed the murder,

676
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,458
because at 6:15 on that night,

677
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,291
you were boarding a train
for London.

678
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,416
But what we did not know

679
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,124
was that there was
another passenger

680
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,583
who also boarded that train.

681
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:09,874
This person

682
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,791
alighted from the train
at the very next stop

683
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,958
and stole the bicycle
of my friend,

684
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:18,541
M. Anstruther --
a curious thing to do, huh?

685
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:21,874
Hey, that's my bike!

686
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,833
But the next thing
that this person did

687
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,249
was even more curious.

688
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,666
He buried the bicycle.

689
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:37,333
Then he buried all
the necessary accoutrements

690
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,791
of the bearded man...

691
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,291
...and turned himself
back into Mme. Middleton.

692
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,041
Mrs. Middleton
was the bearded man?

693
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:52,333
But, yes, Hastings.

694
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:55,541
You see, we only had the word
of Mme. Middleton herself

695
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,708
that a bearded man came to
the house that night,

696
00:42:57,834 --> 00:42:59,749
but, of course,
that was not true.

697
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,999
No, I saw him.

698
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,083
Mme. Havering, if you please,

699
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:03,333
we will come to that
in a minute.

700
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:04,874
It's as I've said all along,

701
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,208
we've got to find
this Mrs. Middleton.

702
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,999
Well, may I suggest

703
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,916
that you get on
and do just that.

704
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,499
So far, all you've done is ask
impertinent questions

705
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,208
and treat respectable people
like a lot of criminals!

706
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:19,666
Please, M. Roger,
do not be in such haste.

707
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:21,999
We may know that you did not
commit a murder,

708
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:24,666
but there are other things
which are not yet so clear.

709
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:27,458
This crime was of a daring
most extraordinary.

710
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:32,333
It had to be like clockwork.

711
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,791
And the spurious Mme. Middleton

712
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,583
had to have an accomplice
to wind the spring.

713
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,624
Sorry, Mrs. Middleton.

714
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,249
At a quarter to 6:00
on the night of the murder,

715
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,458
this spring,
it was ready for release.

716
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:48,166
The guests had departed,

717
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,249
Mlle. Ellie
had already gone home,

718
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,374
and Mlle. Joan
had been offered a lift

719
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,291
in your car, M. Havering.

720
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,708
Mlle. Joan was duly dropped
at her cottage.

721
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,374
Mme. Middleton
was then to be driven to

722
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,166
the home of M. Stoddard
to collect some game birds,

723
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,291
but, of course,
she never arrived.

724
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:10,916
She was undergoing
a transformation.

725
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,083
It was essential, you see,

726
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,208
that a suspect should be seen
to alight from the train

727
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:18,624
at the very next stop,

728
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,499
a suspect that could well be

729
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,708
M. Roger Havering in disguise.

730
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,833
Why should I try to
incriminate myself?

731
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,624
Because, M. Havering,
you had planned most carefully

732
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,999
your alibi --
your meeting with Lord Quamby,

733
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,208
which you would seem to have
every reason for keeping secret,

734
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,874
but once you were forced to
reveal it and were released,

735
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,083
it was most unlikely
that the police

736
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,374
would suspect you
for a second time.

737
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,583
You're talking complete rubbish.

738
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:47,833
No, no, no,
I think not, M. Havering.

739
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:50,958
You see, while you continued
your journey to London,

740
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,999
Mme. Middleton
returned to Hunter's Lodge.

741
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,249
Your uncle was
a very wealthy man.

742
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,416
In time, you would
inherit his fortune,

743
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,958
but your gambling debts
grew heavier,

744
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:12,208
and M. Pace refused
to bail you out.

745
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:15,166
You desperately needed
the money now,

746
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,541
and so on that fateful night,

747
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:19,458
M. Pace was shot

748
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,166
in cold blood.

749
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,916
Prove it!

750
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:28,916
You just prove it.

751
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:32,374
That is a lying slander.

752
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,708
You're going to find yourself
in court, Mr. bloody Poirot!

753
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,208
And who is this Mrs. Middleton

754
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,166
I'm meant to have been
an accomplice of?

755
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:40,541
You can't even find her.

756
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,874
So you busy yourself
accusing everybody else!

757
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,666
You think that Hercule Poirot
is unable to find

758
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,999
this mysterious Mme. Middleton?

759
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:50,874
Hercule Poirot knows a way

760
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,208
to make Mme. Middleton

761
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:58,583
appear in our midst
as if by magic.

762
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,958
You do not believe in magic?

763
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,124
Very well.

764
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:07,166
I have only to tap with my cane

765
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,833
on the floor three times,

766
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:13,874
thus.

767
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,374
Un...

768
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,708
...deux...

769
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,083
...trois.

770
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,083
Can we not stop this charade,
Chief Inspector?

771
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:58,583
I don't know, sir.
I've always enjoyed party games.

772
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,541
Silly dog, what's it doing?

773
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,708
Will somebody take it away?

774
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,541
Stop it!

775
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,999
-Stop it!
-It's all right, Zoe.

776
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,833
Come on, girl.
Come on, heel!

777
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,458
That's it.
Good girl. Come.

778
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:34,416
I don't know
what your silly game is,

779
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,374
but it seems to have gone
horribly wrong.

780
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,874
Now, leave her alone!

781
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:41,208
Zoe had nothing whatever to do
with this Mrs. Middleton!

782
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:42,999
On the contrary, M. Archie,

783
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:45,958
Mme. Havering had
a very close relationship

784
00:47:46,084 --> 00:47:48,124
with the housekeeper,
Mme. Middleton.

785
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,791
The odd thing about it being

786
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,208
was that they were never once
seen together.

787
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:58,916
This temporary housekeeper
had only recently been employed

788
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,708
for the family's stay
at Hunter's Lodge.

789
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:06,124
She left little notes
for the servants

790
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,624
and kept herself to herself.

791
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,541
If the mistress was at home,
the housekeeper was absent.

792
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,874
When the housekeeper
was downstairs,

793
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:18,916
the mistress was in her room.

794
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,999
And that is where,
on the night of the murder,

795
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:26,166
after she had been interviewed
by the police,

796
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:29,708
Mme. Middleton
disappeared forever

797
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:32,541
from the face of the Earth.

798
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,583
Because it was you,
Mme. Zoe Havering,

799
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,208
together with your husband,
you planned and carried out

800
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:50,916
this murder ingenious.

801
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:54,499
Together, you plotted
to rid yourselves

802
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,166
of your uncle that was hated

803
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,749
and to lay your hands,
at last, on his money.

804
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:02,333
I must ask you both to come
with me to the police station.

805
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:05,166
How dare you?
This has gone far enough.

806
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,999
I do not intend to stand
idly by --

807
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,416
Oh, shut up, Roger!

808
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,791
But why did she have to
bury the bicycle?

809
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,499
How could she leave it lying
around, Hastings?

810
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,291
If it was found and identified
by M. Anstruther

811
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,499
as the bicycle that was stolen
outside the railway station,

812
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,624
then it would show
that the murderer

813
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,749
was still close
to Hunter's Lodge.

814
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,499
Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.

815
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:54,541
M. Anstruther.

816
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,124
The blackberry tea
did the trick, then?

817
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,458
It did, indeed, monsieur.

818
00:49:57,584 --> 00:50:00,833
it also stimulated the little
gray cells to such an extent

819
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,708
that it enabled me
to track down your bicycle.

820
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:07,749
It's a bit of
a blooming mess, isn't it?

821
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:10,291
-Yes, it got buried.
-Buried?

822
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:11,916
Buried.

823
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:14,541
It's all covered
in mud and mold.

824
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:16,999
And I regret that
I did not have the time

825
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,791
to clean it for you, monsieur.

826
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:20,541
I don't know as I could be seen

827
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:21,916
riding about
on a thing like that.

828
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:23,749
That mud guard's all bent, too.

829
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,124
M. Anstruther,

830
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,249
do you or do you not
want your bicycle?

831
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,333
Oh... Oh, just leave it there.

832
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,249
I'll see if the boy
can do anything with it.

833
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,791
Is this gratitude, Hastings?

834
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,416
Is it for this
that Hercule Poirot

835
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,791
exerts his talents
on behalf of the world?

836
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,499
Do you expect gratitude?
Don't make me laugh.

837
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,208
Now you know what
a real detective feels like.

838
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:54,833
"A real detective"?

839
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,083
The Chief Inspector Japp
is truly most amusing,

840
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:00,708
-do you not think, Hastings?
-Oh, yes.

841
00:51:00,834 --> 00:51:02,083
Most amusing.

842
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,791
For a policeman.
