1
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,833
The train now
arriving on Platform 1

2
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,666
is the 5:30 from Ilfracombe,
Barnstaple, Exeter, and Yeovil.

3
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,541
The train now arriving
on Platform 1

4
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:40,833
is the 5:30 from Ilfracombe,
Barnstaple, Exeter, and Yeovil.

5
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,166
Good evening, Countess.

6
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,499
It's an honor to have you
with us again.

7
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,208
Your usual suite is ready.

8
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,166
Thank you.

9
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,333
Thank you, Countess.

10
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:19,791
Doesn't the town look good

11
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,416
at this time of year, Poirot?

12
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,541
Yes, one can always tell
when the summer, it is arrived.

13
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:25,791
It's in the air, eh?

14
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,333
No, Hastings, it is in the speed
of your driving.

15
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,124
Come on, Poirot,
we're only pushing 30.

16
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,541
Sorry, old chap.

17
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,333
Red light.

18
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,708
I prefer the winter.

19
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,083
It is safer.

20
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:49,374
Now, there's a pleasant sight

21
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,916
for you on a summer's day.

22
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:52,624
You ever thought about it?

23
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,374
In my experience,
I have known of five cases

24
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,208
of women murdered
by their devoted husbands.

25
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,874
Yes?

26
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:04,874
And 22 husbands murdered
by their devoted wives.

27
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,833
So, thank you, no.

28
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,666
The marriage,
it is not for me, ah?

29
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,333
And now I think the light,
it is green.

30
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,041
We can proceed -- gently.

31
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,458
Righto.

32
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,916
But I'm not
going to have a crash.

33
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,374
Anyway, we saw a bride.

34
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:31,458
That's supposed to be good luck.

35
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,458
Mr. Poirot, you're back.

36
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,749
The chief inspector's
waiting inside.

37
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,749
Chief Inspector Japp?
Here?

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,874
That must be the luck of which
you speak, Hastings.

39
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,458
I think he's worried
about something.

40
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,958
He hasn't said a word.

41
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,124
Chief Inspector.

42
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,541
Good afternoon, Poirot.

43
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,249
Captain Hastings.

44
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,291
Chief Inspector.

45
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,249
Please, seat yourself.

46
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,833
What matter is it
that brings you here today?

47
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,458
The matter of my job,
if you want the honest truth.

48
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,874
They'd never dismiss you,
would they, Chief Inspector?

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,499
They will if I don't get results
soon, Captain Hastings.

50
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,541
Three robberies
in as many weeks.

51
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,333
Jewelry each time.

52
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,791
The Atterton diamonds
were the first to go.

53
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,458
Lady Atterton?

54
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,874
In the West Country?

55
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,541
Happened during dinner.

56
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,666
Two dukes, a duchess,
and some Russian countess

57
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,374
around the table.

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,291
Not your usual run of witnesses.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,083
They're high society.

60
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,291
Can't get much higher.

61
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,749
That's the trouble.

62
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,208
The commissioner's
come down on me.

63
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,583
He wants action.

64
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,499
If not, he's going to have to
give them a scapegoat.

65
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,874
A goat?

66
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,791
Me.

67
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,583
When was this last robbery?

68
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,624
Three days ago.

69
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,999
Three days?

70
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,541
But it is too late.

71
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,749
It is better to strike
while the metal is warm, yes?

72
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,791
So what can we do?

73
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,708
We wait.

74
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,499
Already the thief,
he is planning his next crime.

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,749
The next crime,

76
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:27,333
it will be his last.

77
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:10,416
This way, Countess.

78
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,124
Lady Runcorn.

79
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,874
How good of you to come.

80
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,708
And how exquisite you look.

81
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,958
Your parties are always
an experience, Marcus.

82
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,458
And tonight is no exception.

83
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,999
We have Nacora the pianist
playing for us.

84
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,208
And you know Katherine Bird.

85
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,708
The contralto?

86
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:45,666
My dear Marcus, one can't get
tickets to hear her

87
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,166
for love or money.

88
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,749
No need for either.

89
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,249
Oh, let me introduce you
to a colleague of mine

90
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,458
from South Africa.

91
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,708
Martin Johnstone, Lady Runcorn.

92
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:56,458
How do you do?

93
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:57,833
Excuse me.

94
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,666
Are you also a collector,
Mr. Johnstone?

95
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,791
What?

96
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,124
Jewelry.

97
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,999
Mr. Hardman has one of the
finest collections in England.

98
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,916
Is Lady Runcorn here?

99
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,541
Yes, I was just talking to her.

100
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,916
Oh, good!

101
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,041
She's quite attractive, really.

102
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,708
I wonder if she misses
the late Lord Runcorn.

103
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,499
For heaven's sake,
do try to be discreet.

104
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,124
You know me, Marcus.

105
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,499
Yes.

106
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,999
Who's that?

107
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,416
Countess Vera Rossakoff.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
She came over from Russia
quite recently.

109
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,499
Yes.

110
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,708
I suggest you keep your hands
off of her, my dear boy.

111
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,208
Why?

112
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,041
You're not in her league.

113
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:57,499
I wonder.

114
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,458
And where have you been?

115
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,208
Busy.

116
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,208
Have you seen my gloves?

117
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,999
No, I haven't.

118
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,999
You couldn't ask
for the trail

119
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,749
to be much fresher
this time, Poirot.

120
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,791
I only heard myself
this morning.

121
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,958
I've been chasing
all over the country

122
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,666
on the other three robberies.

123
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,583
This is the first one
that's been close to London.

124
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,999
Tell me about
this M. Marcus Hardman.

125
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,208
He's a jewelry collector.

126
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,749
Something of a celebrity
in his own way.

127
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,916
Throws a lot of parties,
that sort of thing.

128
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,458
A collector, do you say?

129
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,749
Yes.
Natural target, I suppose.

130
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,624
And yet, in other circumstances,

131
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,166
perhaps also
the natural suspect.

132
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,833
They were in the garden
when it happened.

133
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,333
Some sort of concert.

134
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,833
In the garden?

135
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,374
There's a marquee.

136
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,749
Sir.

137
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,249
You were the constable
on duty last night?

138
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,291
Yes, sir.

139
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,958
Tell us what happened, then.

140
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,333
I was on my beat, sir.

141
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,708
I walked past Mr. Hardman's
house about half past 10:00.

142
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,124
And?

143
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,749
Well, sir, I did see something.

144
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,124
A vagrant.

145
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,624
He was going the other way.
Down there.

146
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:13,249
That vagrant could have had a
£10,000 necklace in his pocket.

147
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,999
I wasn't to know, sir.

148
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,208
Indeed not.

149
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,249
Thank you, Officer.

150
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,499
You've been most assiduous
in your duties.

151
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,916
It's a ghastly thing.
Just ghastly.

152
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,291
I mean, the publicity
will destroy me.

153
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:34,499
When did you notice

154
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,166
that the jewelry was absent,
M. Hardman?

155
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,458
It was this morning.

156
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,124
I got up late
after last night's concert.

157
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,499
We had Nacora play,
and Katherine Bird.

158
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,083
I came into the room --

159
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,708
my beautiful emerald necklace.

160
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,749
But it is insured, Mr. Hardman?

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,166
-Insured?
-Is it?

162
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,708
Well, of course it's insured!

163
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:52,874
That's not the point.

164
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,499
It's irreplaceable.

165
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,499
It used to belong to
Catherine de Medici, you know.

166
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,458
It's through here.

167
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,958
M. Hardman?

168
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,708
This window,
it is kept locked, yes?

169
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:15,333
Of course.

170
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,583
I'll show you the safe.

171
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,916
What's different
about this window?

172
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,958
It looks just like
all the others.

173
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,499
But there is one significant
difference, mon ami.

174
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,958
It is at this point
the climbing plant outside

175
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,333
almost reaches the sill.

176
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,916
And M. Hardman is, I think,

177
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,583
a little overconfident
about the latches.

178
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,541
Has anything been touched?

179
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,458
No, Chief Inspector.

180
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:48,416
This is just how it was
when I came in.

181
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,124
The safe was open,
and the emeralds were gone.

182
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,291
So what's this, then?

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,666
Is this yours, Mr. Hardman?

184
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,083
No.

185
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,749
What do you make of this,
Poirot?

186
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,666
It is a glove of a man --

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,958
a man with small hands.

188
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:24,166
What have we here?

189
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,499
Cigarette case.

190
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,874
Empty.

191
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,249
With the initials B.P.

192
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,208
B.P.

193
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,541
Is that of any significance
to you, M. Hardman?

194
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,791
Well, yes, I suppose it could
belong to Bernard Parker.

195
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,208
And who is he, sir?

196
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,249
Young friend of mine.

197
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,041
Uh, a business associate.

198
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,333
The glove could be his, too.

199
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,666
What makes you say that?

200
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,749
Well, he'd lost it.
He'd lost both his gloves.

201
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,541
At least, that's what he said.

202
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,166
Excuse me.

203
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,874
So what do you think, Poirot?

204
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,874
I think that it is strange.

205
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,166
The glove and the cigarette
case, it is,

206
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,166
as you might say,
the double clue.

207
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,958
Twice as much for us to work on.

208
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,916
It is too much, Hastings,
too much.

209
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,374
To leave the glove
inside the safe...

210
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,291
Perhaps he was in a hurry.

211
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,958
Someone could have
disturbed him.

212
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,999
Poirot?

213
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,874
May I introduce you?

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,124
This is
the Countess Vera Rossakoff.

215
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,541
She was here at the party
last night.

216
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,666
Enchanté, madame.

217
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:58,041
Et moi aussi, monsieur.

218
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:05,999
Hercule Poirot at your service,
madame.

219
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,124
What beautiful gardens,
M. Poirot.

220
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,416
It is so good of you
to escort me.

221
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,124
I wanted to bring you somewhere
that was worthy of you.

222
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,249
You mustn't flatter me,
M. Poirot.

223
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,624
You will make me cry.

224
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,874
I have been so lonely
since I arrived,

225
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,958
and it's been a lovely day.

226
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,499
Yes. I also know what it is

227
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,208
to come to a new country
and to know no one.

228
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,958
Of course.
You yourself are a refugee.

229
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,458
Yes.

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,999
I was head of the police
in Belgium.

231
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,791
But then came the Great War.

232
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,166
I was forced to leave.

233
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,416
I came to England -- to
the village of Styles St. Mary.

234
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,499
But it was a sad and painful
time for me --

235
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,791
so far from my family
and my home.

236
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,374
Poor M. Poirot.

237
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,041
Oh, no, I have had
a good fortune.

238
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,166
My talent,
it has been recognized.

239
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,041
It is reported that I am

240
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,583
the most famous detective
in England.

241
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,333
Is Poirot here?

242
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:17,708
No, actually not.

243
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:18,916
-Hastings?
-Yes.

244
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,624
Excuse me.

245
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,291
Where is he?

246
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,458
You all right, Chief Inspector?

247
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,708
No.
I'm not all right.

248
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,458
I'll be lucky
to be chief inspector

249
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:31,833
by the end of the week.

250
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,083
As bad as that, eh?

251
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,833
It's been three days,
Captain Hastings.

252
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,416
Three days, and nothing!

253
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,666
Well, Poirot is on the case,
you know.

254
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,958
Then why aren't you with him?

255
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,458
I don't know.

256
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,083
I suppose he wanted to pursue
his own line of inquiry.

257
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:50,208
This jewelry business
is going to be the end of me.

258
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,749
Don't worry, old chap.

259
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,208
You know Poirot.

260
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,791
He really is getting somewhere?

261
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:01,708
Oh, yes, I'm sure he's
on the right track.

262
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,291
And so you are investigating
the case of the stolen jewelry?

263
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,041
It seems a simple matter,
madame.

264
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,333
To England's most famous
detective, of course.

265
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,624
Do you suspect me?

266
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,874
Ha!
Should I?

267
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,374
I was there.

268
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
That is true.

269
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,458
So, tell me, madame, why did you
return the following day?

270
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,666
I had an appointment
with Mr. Hardman.

271
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,916
I was considering selling
some of my own jewelry.

272
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:50,416
I had a house like this
once in Petrograd.

273
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,041
First the house.

274
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,499
Then a wing in the house.

275
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,916
Then a room in the wing.

276
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,458
And now nothing.

277
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,874
But that does not make you
the thief, madame.

278
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,166
No.

279
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,874
Life itself is the thief.

280
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:21,624
It has taken everything I had.

281
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,958
Well, I suppose it had to happen
one day.

282
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,458
He's really quite taken,
you know.

283
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,916
Are you sure, Captain Hastings?

284
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,541
You should have seen him.

285
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,249
Well, anyway, we haven't seen
him, not for three days.

286
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
That's not like him.

287
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,624
What about poor old Japp?

288
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,416
Looks like he could be
for the chop.

289
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,958
If only we could help.

290
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,208
Maybe we can.

291
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,583
How?

292
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,708
Look, according
to Marcus Hardman,

293
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,499
only four people went into
the house during the concert.

294
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,458
That's when the jewels
were taken.

295
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,499
Bernard Parker,
Martin Johnstone,

296
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,624
Lady Runcorn,
and the countess.

297
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,416
Suppose it was her!

298
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,999
No, it can't have been her.

299
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,791
I mean, I hope to God it wasn't.

300
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,749
So what can we do?

301
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,458
Well, we can talk
to the other three

302
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,999
and solve the case ourselves.

303
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,499
I know old Japp suspects that
tramp the constable spotted,

304
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,208
but I think we should speak
to them all,

305
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:44,041
starting with Mr. Johnstone.

306
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,624
How dare you, sir?

307
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,541
If I want a jewel necklace,

308
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,124
I can afford to go into a shop
and buy one!

309
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,874
In fact, I can afford
to buy the shop.

310
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,541
So why did you go back
into the house, Mr. Johnstone?

311
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,749
The call of nature,
if you must know.

312
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,333
Were there any witnesses?

313
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,208
So, Lady Runcorn,

314
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,833
you don't deny that you went
back into the house.

315
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,416
But I just told you that,
Captain Hastings.

316
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,624
Hmm.

317
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,666
Did you see anyone else inside?

318
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,166
Yes, there was someone coming
out of the downstairs bathroom.

319
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,749
But I didn't see who it was.

320
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,124
Why were you in the house,
Lady Runcorn?

321
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:47,541
I went to fetch my handbag.

322
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:53,166
I'd left it inside.

323
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,499
Eh bien, Countess.

324
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,749
Tomorrow I will take you
to the Tate Gallery

325
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,124
to see their collection
of the Turners.

326
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,583
But I find these expressionist
painters so exciting.

327
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,333
Don't you, Hercule?

328
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,583
In part, yes.

329
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,374
Do you know, I do not believe

330
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,708
that there is anyone
of my acquaintance

331
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,249
who calls me by that name.

332
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,208
Oh.

333
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,583
I am so sorry.

334
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,208
Excuse me.

335
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,124
Madame.

336
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,458
Now, this I find most pleasing.

337
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,291
Marc Chagall.

338
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,083
Another Russian in exile.

339
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,499
He lives in Paris, I believe.

340
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,666
A constructivist, they call him.

341
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:45,208
But one only has to look
at his work to see --

342
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,208
Yes?

343
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:50,374
He is still in Russia.

344
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,166
He never left.

345
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,333
Like you, Countess.

346
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,124
Oh, no.

347
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,124
It's another world now.

348
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,208
Stalin, Hitler.

349
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,333
Everywhere you look,
it's all changing.

350
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,166
Goodbye, Lady Runcorn.

351
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:19,374
Goodbye, Captain Hastings.

352
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:25,166
Captain Hastings, look.

353
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,166
"B.P."

354
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,624
Bernard Parker!

355
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:33,874
Yes, I do some work
for Marcus --

356
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,791
Mr. Hardman.

357
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,999
I arrange his more
insalubrious deals.

358
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,083
What do you mean by that?

359
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:48,166
When the client doesn't
want his or her name

360
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,166
dragged through the mud,
I act as a sort of...

361
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,916
go-between.

362
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,208
I don't --

363
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:57,124
In high society, Captain,
nobody is ever hard up.

364
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,041
At least,
they don't admit to it.

365
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,916
So when they are hard up,
they come to me.

366
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,083
And I go to Marcus.

367
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,499
Have you lost a glove,
Mr. Parker?

368
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:09,874
Oh, the glove.

369
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,208
That simply loathsome
Inspector Snapp

370
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:15,666
has already been on to me
about the glove.

371
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,708
Do you know
he wanted to arrest me?

372
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,249
Was it yours?

373
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:21,791
Yes,

374
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,708
but I've told him, I had both my
gloves when the concert began,

375
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,916
and that was the last time
I saw them.

376
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,083
And as for the cigarette case,

377
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:31,374
I've never seen it before
in my life.

378
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,458
It had your initials.

379
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:36,416
Oh, my dear, I'm sure you'll
find plenty of people in London

380
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,958
with the initials B.P.

381
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:41,333
By the way,

382
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,624
have you ever done
any embroidery?

383
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,499
Embroidery?

384
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,833
You know -- needlework.

385
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,166
That sort of thing.

386
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,541
No.

387
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,291
No.

388
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,541
And what of the perfect crime?

389
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,999
It is an illusion, Countess.

390
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,249
Maybe.

391
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,458
But let me tell you
something I heard.

392
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:16,291
It was a robbery
like the one at Mr. Hardman's,

393
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,791
but this time, it was diamonds.

394
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,541
Please go on.

395
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,874
Twelve people sat down
to dinner.

396
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,541
The safe was in the next room.

397
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,166
The hostess herself had checked
that the diamonds were in place

398
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,833
before the meal had begun.

399
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,333
And after?

400
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,708
The safe was open

401
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,541
and empty.

402
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,541
And there were no clues?

403
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,833
None.

404
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,583
It is strange
that you should choose

405
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:43,749
to relate this to me, Countess.

406
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:44,833
I also have read of it.

407
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:45,874
Yes?

408
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,499
Oh, yes.
The Atterton diamonds.

409
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,499
And it is true that the police,
they were confounded,

410
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,499
but that is because they look
with the eyes that is too...

411
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,874
English.

412
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,708
I don't understand.

413
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,416
Well, they see the dukes
and the duchesses,

414
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,374
the lords and the ladies,
but they fail to ask themselves

415
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,083
the one simple question.

416
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,833
Which is?

417
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,624
What person was at that dinner

418
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,874
who was also at the soiree
of M. Hardman

419
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:12,249
and on two other occasions
when some jewels were stolen?

420
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,583
So you are saying
the police cannot solve it

421
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,958
because they are too English?

422
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,708
Or because the culprit,
he is not English enough.

423
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,124
Thank you for
a really lovely day.

424
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,749
Countess.

425
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,874
Will I see you tomorrow?

426
00:28:58,834 --> 00:28:59,791
For a déjeuner?

427
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,166
Oui.

428
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:05,208
The Carlton Hotel.

429
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,124
Bernard Parker must have been
in love with Lady Runcorn.

430
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,958
He gave her the embroidery,
but lied about it to us.

431
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:29,083
I think Johnstone
was lying, as well.

432
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,458
I'm sure it's him.

433
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:35,083
I say, Poirot.

434
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:36,999
Learning Russian?

435
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,208
I wonder why.

436
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:42,291
It has been an invaluable aid,
mon ami.

437
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,416
Yes, I couldn't get past
the alphabet, myself.

438
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,666
No, it is indeed complicated.

439
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,666
Yes, like this case.

440
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,458
The stolen jewels?

441
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,999
We've been investigating,
Mr. Poirot.

442
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,124
You're not the only private
detective in London, you know.

443
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,541
This is true, mon ami.

444
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:07,624
Eh bien, tell me all
that you have discovered.

445
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:15,333
So we think Bernard Parker
is blackmailing Lady Runcorn.

446
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,874
We've discovered
she has huge debts,

447
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,708
and she's recently sent
four paintings to auction.

448
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,958
She must have sold them
to pay him off.

449
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:25,208
So you say Lady Runcorn
requires money?

450
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,416
Yes.

451
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,874
So is it not more likely
that Lady Runcorn

452
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,458
would meet with
M. Bernard Parker

453
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,499
to discuss the selling
of her jewels?

454
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,958
That is his occupation,
is it not?

455
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,208
Ah, but what about
the embroidery?

456
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:40,374
He signed it "B.P."

457
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,083
But then I wonder
what Lady Runcorn was called

458
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,958
before she became Lady Runcorn.

459
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,666
Oh.

460
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,624
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

461
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,791
If you are to be Hercule Poirot,
you must think of everything.

462
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,791
Lady Runcorn.

463
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,083
Born Beatrice Palmerston.

464
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,666
B.P.

465
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:12,333
He's right.

466
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,999
So, all right, then, Poirot.

467
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,583
What do you think?

468
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:23,916
I think, Hastings, you must ask
yourself one question.

469
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:25,291
Yes?

470
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,416
The tramp.

471
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,958
What was he doing there?

472
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,374
And the answer?

473
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,916
You will find only by returning
to the home

474
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:33,458
of M. Marcus Hardman.

475
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,666
I suggest that you go tomorrow.

476
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:36,791
Well, what about you?

477
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,833
This case does not
interest Poirot.

478
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,374
I have no enthusiasm for it.

479
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,749
And it is as you yourself say,
Hastings.

480
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,583
There are other
private detectives.

481
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:48,583
Yes, I'm sure.

482
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,958
What about poor old Japp?

483
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:55,333
Hmm.

484
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,916
No, sir, nothing as yet, sir.

485
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,916
But I am following up
a few leads.

486
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,708
Uh, well, no, sir, they haven't
actually led anywhere yet.

487
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,541
Well, if you could just give me
a little bit more time --

488
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,666
48 hours?

489
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:19,166
Well, I was hoping for a little
bit more time than that, sir.

490
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,791
I can assure you, sir,
your wife is perfectly safe.

491
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:29,291
If you'd like to put her on,
I can assure her myself, sir.

492
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,624
No, sir, I didn't mean that,
sir.

493
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,458
Right, sir.

494
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,124
Yes, sir.

495
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,666
I am working on it, sir.

496
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,749
I'll do that, sir.

497
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,249
Thank you.

498
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:05,833
Good evening.

499
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:10,083
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

500
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,791
Poirot?

501
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,124
Not the Hercule Poirot?

502
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,541
The very same.

503
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,833
Please, sit down, sir.

504
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,124
No, thank you.

505
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,499
What can we do for you?

506
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,541
I have a friend who requires
my immediate help.

507
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,791
But I cannot help,
and so I turn to you.

508
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,541
You mean you want us to sort of
deputize for you?

509
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,499
Oui, c'est ça.

510
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,666
You must act on my behalf.

511
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,958
It must be something important

512
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,208
for you to ask for our help,
M. Poirot.

513
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,291
It is a matter of the utmost
importance, monsieur.

514
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,916
There is a reputation --

515
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,708
No, there is a life
that is at stake.

516
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:59,041
But Hercule Poirot
is not involved.

517
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,083
The tramp.

518
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,749
What was the tramp doing here?

519
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,249
I can't see how wandering around
the grounds

520
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,041
is going to give us the answer.

521
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,333
Let's be methodical,
Captain Hastings.

522
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:17,249
Mr. Poirot must have a reason
for sending us here.

523
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,458
Four people went
into that house.

524
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:22,416
You'd have thought one of them
must have done it.

525
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:24,041
How about Lady Runcorn?

526
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,499
If her name was
Beatrice Palmerston once,

527
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,041
the cigarette case
could have belonged to her.

528
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,416
B.P.

529
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,499
Maybe she was working
with Bernard Parker.

530
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,958
They were in the house
at the same time.

531
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:37,916
What about that wretched tramp?

532
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,916
I just don't see
where he fits in.

533
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,374
Miss Lemon, look!
Over there.

534
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,583
It's him.

535
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,791
Wait here.

536
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:48,166
Hey, you!
Stop!

537
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,749
Captain Hastings!
He's got a gun!

538
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,541
Are you all right?

539
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,833
I think so.

540
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,749
Listen.

541
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,916
Well, that's the first tramp
I've seen

542
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,374
behind the wheel of an MG.

543
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,374
Ow!

544
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,541
It's iodine, Captain Hastings.

545
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,333
I said it'd sting.

546
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,333
It is me who suffers, my friend,

547
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,791
to think that I sent you.

548
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:27,916
Oh, it's not your fault, Poirot.

549
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,374
But, yes, Hastings.

550
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,791
It was me who sent you
to the house,

551
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,499
and but for your speed
and agility --

552
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,416
He fired four times, Mr. Poirot!

553
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:37,999
I know, Miss Lemon.

554
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,249
Did you know the tramp
would come back?

555
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,708
No, but I am an imbecile.

556
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,708
I see only half of the picture.

557
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,124
I don't even see that.

558
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,874
Miss Lemon, would you be so good

559
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:50,749
as to telephone
the Chief Inspector Japp?

560
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:53,708
Ask him to meet us at the home
of Marcus Hardman.

561
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,166
What about your lunch
with the countess?

562
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,541
Ah! Well...

563
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:00,833
we will meet after lunch.

564
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,249
At 3:00.

565
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:03,833
Where are you taking her?

566
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:07,833
It is the countess who takes me.

567
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,958
You astonish me, madame.

568
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,499
I am lost in admiration.

569
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,208
It's just a picnic.

570
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,416
We used to have such picnics.

571
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,291
Suppose he --

572
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,916
Poirot and the countess...

573
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,583
He wouldn't.

574
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,833
Would he?

575
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,333
I don't know.

576
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,624
I've never seen him
like this before.

577
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:04,458
And now a toast.

578
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,291
I shall propose one, if I may.

579
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,374
To crime.

580
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,583
That is a strange toast,

581
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,499
coming from a detective.

582
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,374
And yet it is my raison d'être.

583
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,874
My life is ruled by it.

584
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:25,124
And it is crime
that has brought us together.

585
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:31,541
Then, to crime.

586
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,416
He couldn't.

587
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:38,208
He just couldn't.

588
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,249
You'd be out of a situation.

589
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,666
And what about you?

590
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,249
Oh, I could travel.

591
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:56,333
I've always had a dream about
South America, you know.

592
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:57,583
Farming.

593
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,916
You'd miss him, though,
wouldn't you?

594
00:38:01,084 --> 00:38:02,333
Of course I would.

595
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:08,291
What about you?

596
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:20,083
I don't want to talk about it.

597
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:23,833
And now, I think --

598
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,208
Yes.

599
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,874
I have an investigation
with the Chief Inspector Japp.

600
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,749
And it must be resolved.

601
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,791
Is there anything I can do?

602
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,916
This time I fear
the culprit may escape,

603
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,333
or this time,

604
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,249
the culprit may never be named.

605
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,291
That depends entirely upon you.

606
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,499
Me?

607
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,916
I think so.

608
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:15,124
Could this help?

609
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:37,499
Only four people came into
the house during the concert.

610
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,416
The countess, M. Johnstone,

611
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,291
Lady Runcorn,
and M. Bernard Parker.

612
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:46,833
The thorough investigation
of my colleagues

613
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,999
eliminated M. Johnstone
and Lady Runcorn.

614
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:51,499
M. Johnstone,
because he's a very wealthy man.

615
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,708
And Lady Runcorn?

616
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,291
Lady Runcorn because

617
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,249
she came to the house
in order to meet

618
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,999
with M. Bernard Parker.

619
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,374
Is that not so, M. Hardman?

620
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,166
Yes.

621
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:06,958
But no one must know.

622
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,374
My whole business --

623
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,958
it thrives on nobody knowing.

624
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:15,041
D'accord.

625
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,249
And finally,
there is the countess,

626
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,958
who entered the house
in order to get her coat.

627
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,708
Her coat?

628
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,583
I thought it was a warm evening.

629
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:26,874
Yes, it was, Chief Inspector.

630
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:30,541
But I had been outside
for more than an hour.

631
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,083
Well, yes, but --

632
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,624
And forgive me,

633
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,874
but if that Japanese contralto
had sung one more high note,

634
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,791
my head would have shattered.

635
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:41,374
And while you were
inside, Countess,

636
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,874
you caught sight of a figure,
non?

637
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,958
And you disturbed him,
n'est-ce pas?

638
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:46,666
Yes, but I only glimpsed him.

639
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,291
Going where?

640
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,249
From this room to the window.

641
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,499
Ah, yes.

642
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,583
The window
with a climbing plant.

643
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,416
That brings us to the tramp

644
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,583
and one very important
question --

645
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,999
why did he come back?

646
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,499
Yes, and how could he afford
an MG, for that matter?

647
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,041
The tramp who was no tramp

648
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,583
used the climbing plant

649
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,416
in order to enter the house.

650
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,874
Now, for him,
the window was no obstacle.

651
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,291
The safe, also,
he opened with ease.

652
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,458
So what about the clues?

653
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:24,291
The glove belonged
to M. Bernard Parker.

654
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:26,499
It was put there
to incriminate him.

655
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,208
The case belonged
to Lady Runcorn --

656
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:32,083
or Beatrice Palmerston,
as once she was called.

657
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,541
But always, I think,
she will deny it.

658
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,624
Why?

659
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,958
Because she brought it here
in order to sell it.

660
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:39,666
She'll never admit that.

661
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,124
She's too proud.

662
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,749
That is quite true, Miss Lemon.

663
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,041
So the tramp took the jewels?

664
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,541
What did he do then?

665
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:52,249
He returned to the window,

666
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,624
where he was disturbed
by the countess.

667
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,666
He slipped, and he fell.

668
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,166
And the necklace?

669
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,791
The necklace, he dropped,

670
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,166
which is why
he had to come back.

671
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,666
Wait a minute.

672
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:43,708
I've got it.

673
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,749
Voilà.

674
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:54,041
Green against green.

675
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,291
My necklace.

676
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,583
What about the tramp?

677
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:05,374
I'd still like to collar him,
you know, Poirot.

678
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:09,749
Oui, d'accord, but I fear
it is too late.

679
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,083
What's the matter?

680
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,374
Just something she said.

681
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:53,958
Who?

682
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:55,291
The countess.

683
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,333
She said the singer
was Japanese.

684
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,083
It was the pianist
who was Japanese.

685
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:02,208
What of it?

686
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:05,749
Well, if she really had been
in the garden for an hour,

687
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:08,624
surely she would have known.

688
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:22,916
Good night.

689
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:26,541
Miss Lemon, I thought
you had already gone.

690
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,333
No, I had some letters
to finish.

691
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:38,041
You're working late, Mr. Poirot?

692
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:41,124
Yes, I have from
the Chief Inspector Japp

693
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,333
the reports
of the jewelry thefts.

694
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:45,958
This work, Miss Lemon --

695
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:49,124
sometimes it is not
so straightforward.

696
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,083
You do work so hard,
Mr. Poirot.

697
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,124
Sometimes I think,
really, you ought --

698
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,624
Yes, Miss Lemon?

699
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:00,541
Nothing, Mr. Poirot.

700
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,458
Good night, Miss Lemon.

701
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:05,958
Good night.

702
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,124
Ten minutes until your train.

703
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,749
Yes.

704
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,541
And then your ship to America.

705
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:49,666
Yes.

706
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,041
Thank you.

707
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:05,958
Madame, you are
the most remarkable,

708
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,041
the most unique woman
that I have ever met.

709
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,999
But also --

710
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,208
Opposites.

711
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:17,333
C'est ça.

712
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,583
You must continue your work,
and I must continue mine.

713
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:29,041
But not in the same country.

714
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,374
Countess, please allow me
to introduce

715
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:44,041
two colleagues of mine --

716
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,041
Messieurs Redfern and Blake.

717
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:48,499
Good evening, ma'am.

718
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,166
They are, like myself,
private detectives.

719
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,916
Do you really think
I need an escort?

720
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,791
No, no, no, no.

721
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,708
They are for your protection.

722
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,541
During your short visit
in England,

723
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:03,791
there have been four
very clever robberies.

724
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:06,458
I would not wish you to be
involved in a fifth.

725
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:08,333
Of course.

726
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,083
Are they armed?

727
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,916
I believe that M. Redfern
does carry a gun.

728
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:25,916
Yes, loaded with blanks,
of course.

729
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,874
Ah, yes.

730
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,124
M. Redfern played the tramp

731
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,499
more convincingly
than I had expected.

732
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,624
But pauvre Hastings.

733
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,583
I am afraid
that it was necessary

734
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:39,041
to lead him off the scent.

735
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,249
But I forget.

736
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,624
I have something for you.

737
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,083
A parting present?

738
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,999
A souvenir.

739
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:20,791
The cigarette case?

740
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,833
The double clue.

741
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,499
It's of no use to me.

742
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:31,041
It's inscribed "B.P."

743
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,416
Yes.

744
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,374
And yet,
in the Russian alphabet,

745
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:40,124
a "B" is a "V,"
and a "P" is an "R," is it not?

746
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:44,916
Vera Rossakoff?

747
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,833
You've been studying.

748
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,541
You will keep it, I hope?

749
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,499
Something to remember me by.

750
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:02,041
Oh.

751
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,333
I won't forget you.

752
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,874
Hercule.

753
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:15,666
Nor I you,

754
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:20,916
Countess.

755
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,208
Au revoir.
