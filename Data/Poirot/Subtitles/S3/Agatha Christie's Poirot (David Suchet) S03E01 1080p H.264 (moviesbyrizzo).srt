1
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,166
You go straight up to the ward.
They'll see you there.

2
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,541
The idea.

3
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,833
I'd like to see
Lieutenant Hastings, please.

4
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,541
-Hastings.
-When's the next ambulance --

5
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,124
Just a moment, nurse.
I'll be with you in a moment.

6
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,499
Royal Fusiliers.
The new film has arrived.

7
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,333
You'll probably find him
upstairs, watching.

8
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,708
Thank you.

9
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,999
Excuse me, Lieutenant Hastings.
There's a gentleman to see you.

10
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,874
Right. Thank you.

11
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,458
Don't you recognize
your old friends?

12
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:44,999
Good Lord! John Cavendish!

13
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,874
How wonderful to see you.

14
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,208
I tried to join up,
but they said I was too ancient.

15
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,374
What about
your brother Lawrence?

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,999
-Is he practicing medicine yet?
-Well, he wasn't until the war.

17
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,041
I don't know why
he bothered to qualify.

18
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,541
Then they made him go to work
at the local hospital.

19
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,458
He's still writing, though.

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,583
Anything published?

21
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,249
Stories, poems.
Bits and pieces in magazines.

22
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,541
I suppose you heard
Mother married again.

23
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,249
Good heavens!
No, I didn't know that.

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,458
Some fellow turned up
on the pretext

25
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,958
of being Evie's second cousin
or something.

26
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:25,999
You remember Evie.

27
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,708
-Evie?
-Evie Howard.

28
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,999
She's Mother's factotum,
companion, jack-of-all-trades.

29
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,499
Great sport, old Evie.

30
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,999
Must have been after my time.

31
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,583
Well, anyway, this fellow
Inglethorp turned up,

32
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,458
and about a month later
the mater suddenly announced

33
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,499
that she and Alfred
were engaged.

34
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,749
I mean, he must be
20 years younger than she is.

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,624
Good Lord.

36
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,708
Difficult situation
for all of you.

37
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:49,958
Difficult?

38
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,333
It's damnable.

39
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,374
Can you get away
from this place?

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,291
Well, I'm not a prisoner here,
you know.

41
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,124
But you're up to traveling,
aren't you?

42
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,333
I mean, I was going to suggest
you come down for a few days.

43
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,499
I'd love to.

44
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,708
I could do with a break
from the army.

45
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,041
I could come down on Saturday
if that's all right.

46
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,833
That's marvelous.

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,708
Styles St. Mary!
Styles St. Mary!

48
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,541
-Hastings.
-John. Good of you to meet me.

49
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,541
Come on.

50
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,999
Still got a drop or two
of petrol, you see.

51
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,958
Thanks to
the Minister of Agriculture.

52
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,499
Do you have to do
a lot of driving?

53
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,541
Quite a bit.

54
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,791
I have to visit every farm

55
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,041
within a 20-mile radius
once a month.

56
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,999
I wonder if we've got time
to pick up Cynthia and Lawrence.

57
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,833
No, they'll have started
from the hospital by now.

58
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,333
Is Cynthia your wife?

59
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,083
No, no. Cynthia's a protégée
of my mother's.

60
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,749
Daughter of an old schoolfellow.

61
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,583
She was left penniless, and my
mother came to the rescue.

62
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,124
She works at the same hospital
as Lawrence in Malmesbury.

63
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,416
Come on.

64
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,208
I'm afraid you'll find it
very quiet down here.

65
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,666
My dear fellow,
after the joys of France,

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,041
that's just what I want.

67
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,499
-Is that one of your neighbors?
-Hmm?

68
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,833
Girl on the horse.
Beautiful girl.

69
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,374
Yes, I suppose she is.

70
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,541
No, that's Mrs. Raikes, widow of
one of the farmers hereabouts.

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,499
Hello, Evie.

72
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,458
Here's our wounded hero.

73
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,166
Lieutenant Hastings,
Miss Howard.

74
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,166
How do you do?

75
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,874
Better be careful,
Lieutenant Hastings,

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,333
or I'll recruit you
for the weeding.

77
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,833
Oh, only too delighted.

78
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,291
Don't be polite.
You'll regret it later.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,249
In case of refusal,

80
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,374
Lady Tadminster might open
the fete on the first day

81
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,833
and Mrs. Crosbie on the second.

82
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,791
But what about the duchess?

83
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,166
Lieutenant Hastings has arrived,
Mother.

84
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,583
Why, Mr. Hastings!

85
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,291
After all these years.

86
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,166
Are you quite recovered
from your wound?

87
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,333
Oh, yes, pretty well, you know,
Mrs. Inglethorp.

88
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,374
Just a scratch.

89
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,333
Alfred, darling,
this is Mr. Hastings.

90
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,708
Mr. Hastings, my husband.

91
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,999
I'm delighted to meet you,
Lieutenant Hastings.

92
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,666
How do you do?

93
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,999
Mary.
Lieutenant Hastings.

94
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,291
Lieutenant Hastings,
I've heard so much about you.

95
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,999
And I you, Mrs. Cavendish.
John's a lucky man.

96
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,916
Ahh. Seedcake.

97
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:34,916
-Bye, Cynthia.
-Bye.

98
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,041
Bye, Lawrence. Bye!

99
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,291
We're late.

100
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,249
Your mother hates us
being late for tea.

101
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,499
She just likes to get us
all on parade.

102
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,624
Emily.

103
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,749
Oh, well.
One keeps busy, you know.

104
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:52,541
Comforts for the troops.
Armament drives.

105
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,458
How many events
have we got arranged

106
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:57,458
over the next three months,
Alfred?

107
00:08:57,584 --> 00:08:59,291
Three bazaars and two fetes.

108
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,791
Yes, and of course
the sale of work.

109
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,624
You know, my dear,
I'm sure that cushion is damp.

110
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,458
-Oh.
-Allow me.

111
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,833
There.

112
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,624
That's better, dearest.

113
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,124
Can't have you sitting
on damp cushions, can't we?

114
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,791
You're so thoughtful, Alfred.

115
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,458
-Dashed good seedcake.
-Thank you, Dorcas.

116
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,124
Ah. Here's Cynthia.

117
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,083
You're very late today, Cynthia.

118
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,291
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
The bus was late.

119
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,916
This is Mr. Hastings.
Miss Murdoch.

120
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,291
How do you do?

121
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,333
-Where's Lawrence?
-Oh, he's just gone upstairs.

122
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,374
He'll be down in a minute.

123
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,708
He'd better hurry up.
There won't be any cake left.

124
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,791
I've got a cousin who's nursing.

125
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,583
She seems to spend most of
her time placating the sister.

126
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh, they're terrifying.
You've no idea.

127
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,708
But I'm not a nurse,
thank heaven.

128
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,124
I work in the dispensary.

129
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,458
Oh. How many people
have you poisoned?

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,166
Oh, hundreds.

131
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:56,958
Don't talk such nonsense,
Cynthia, please.

132
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,374
What will you do after the war,
Lieutenant Hastings?

133
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,958
Well, you may laugh at me,

134
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,666
but I've always had a secret
hankering to be a detective.

135
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,458
I was in Belgium before the war,

136
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,041
and I ran across
a very famous detective there.

137
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,374
What were you doing in Belgium?

138
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,249
Duck shooting, actually.

139
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,291
This detective
was down from Brussels,

140
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,208
investigating a murder
in the village.

141
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,041
I think I was a suspect
for a time

142
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,874
because the victim was shot with
the same sort of gun as I had.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,916
How frightful.

144
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,333
Oh, no.
Not really.

145
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,041
My system's based on his.

146
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,124
Though, of course,
I've progressed rather further.

147
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,666
He was a funny little man.

148
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,249
A great dandy
but wonderfully clever.

149
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,958
I love a good detective story.

150
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,124
Dr. Wilkins was saying yesterday

151
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,749
that owing to the ignorance
of the more uncommon poisons

152
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,833
among the medical profession,

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,041
there are probably
countless cases of murder

154
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,041
that went quite unsuspected.

155
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,249
Can we talk about
something else?

156
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,374
My brother's a bit sensitive
about this,

157
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,874
being a medical man himself.

158
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,916
Hold your fire!

159
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,458
Another example
of the English bucolic beliefs.

160
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,041
Anagallis arvensis.

161
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,416
In English,
the scarlet pimpernel.

162
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,958
It is believed that when
this flower is open,

163
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,374
it is a sign of a prolonged
spell of the fine weather.

164
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,624
It is seldom seen open
in this country.

165
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,791
Something the matter,
M. van der Stadt?

166
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,624
He wants to know why we have to
speak English all the time.

167
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,666
He finds it tiring.

168
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:15,874
Hmm.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,458
Because, M. van der Stadt, in
this country, we are the guests.

170
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,999
If we are to gain the confidence
of the natives,

171
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,624
we must learn their ways.

172
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,624
You men -- Where are
the rest of your platoon?

173
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,374
They're -- They're dead, sir.

174
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,083
Least, they said they wasn't,

175
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,749
but the umpire said
they had to be.

176
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,041
Well, get rid
of these civilians anyway.

177
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,708
Styles Court really is
a glorious old place.

178
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,791
Yes.
Yes, it is.

179
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,499
It will be mine someday.

180
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,583
And our house in London, too.

181
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:01,874
I managed to persuade Mother

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,958
that Inglethorp's
got no right to them.

183
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,583
No moral right, anyway.

184
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,416
As it stands at the moment,
I get the houses,

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,249
but Inglethorp
gets all the money.

186
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Can't your brother help out?

187
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,749
Lawrence? No.

188
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,833
We're an impecunious lot.

189
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:23,166
My mother's always been awfully
good to us, I must say.

190
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,916
That is, up to now.

191
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,666
Since her marriage, of course.

192
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,999
Come on.
Let's go back to the house.

193
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:41,958
Do you remember the song

194
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,791
that the British soldiers
taught us?

195
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,041
Why don't we try
and sing it together?

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,249
Keep in tune!

197
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,416
Ohh!

198
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,999
-Good afternoon, M. Poirot.
-Good afternoon, Dr. Wilkins.

199
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,416
Good afternoon, messieurs.

200
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:14,374
I see you have
joined the cavalry, eh?

201
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,749
Yes. I'm on my way home.

202
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,041
It's the second time
I've been killed in a month.

203
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,083
Ah.

204
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,208
I say, do you fancy a pint
of beer, if there's any left?

205
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,708
Non, merci.

206
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:29,041
I cannot yet bring myself to
enjoy the English public house.

207
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,999
All those bottles
of the different size,

208
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,208
all in the wrong order.

209
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:32,916
Eh!

210
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:37,208
Doesn't seem to bother
your compatriots.

211
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:43,541
Oh, what is the use?

212
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,541
I try to instill in them
a sense of order, method, but...

213
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,083
always they disappear
into the public house.

214
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:04,458
Jolly good horse.

215
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,541
I thought they'd
commandeered anything decent

216
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,666
for military service.

217
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,916
Agricultural use is one of
the exemptions, fortunately.

218
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,124
I hack 'round the estate
nearly every day.

219
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,666
There's really so little to do
'round here.

220
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,249
You work on the land, though,
don't you?

221
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,833
Yes. Though it's frightfully
early in the morning.

222
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,416
I'm usually finished at the farm
by midday.

223
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,374
I wouldn't have
thought it was woman's work.

224
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,208
There's a war on.
We've all got to do what we can.

225
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,291
Well, the uniform
looks jolly nice anyway.

226
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,749
That cream-colored overall.

227
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,541
There. Good boy.

228
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,624
Thank you.

229
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,374
Lieutenant Hastings, your leg.

230
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,999
I didn't think.
Are you all right?

231
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,874
No, no, no.
It's fine now, really.

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,624
I don't think
I need this anymore.

233
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,416
Here you are.
Compliments of the British Army.

234
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,958
I've never known it so hot
in June before.

235
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:56,166
What we need
is a cool glass of lemonade.

236
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,208
Lemonade?

237
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,583
I haven't seen a lemon
since 1914.

238
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,166
-Game of tennis later?
-Love to.

239
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,624
Mary, Hastings, come into my
study for a moment, will you?

240
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,291
What's the matter?

241
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,958
There's a deuce of a mess.

242
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:23,541
Evie's had a row
with Inglethorp, and she's off.

243
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,708
-Off?
-She's leaving.

244
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,874
Given in her notice.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,624
You see, she went to see
the mater, and they had --

246
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,749
Well, I've spoken my mind,
anyway.

247
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,416
-Evie, this can't be true.
-True enough.

248
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,166
I'm afraid
I said some things to Emily

249
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,291
she won't forget or forgive
in a hurry.

250
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,666
Oh, Evie.

251
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,499
"You're an old woman, Emily,"
I said.

252
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,041
"And there's no fool
like an old fool.

253
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,666
The man's 20 years younger
than you."

254
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:46,958
Oh, no.

255
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:48,374
Well, I'm sorry.
I had to do it.

256
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,749
I had to tell her.

257
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,916
I said,
"I'm going to warn you, Emily,

258
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,999
whether you like it
or whether you don't.

259
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,541
That man would as soon as murder
you in your bed as look at you.

260
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,833
He's a bad lot."

261
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,958
Good God.
What did she say?

262
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,041
Oh, "Wicked calumnies.

263
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,374
Wicked lies. Wicked woman.

264
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,166
Darling Alfred."

265
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,916
Et cetera, et cetera.

266
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,583
Ended up by saying the sooner
I left her house, the better.

267
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,416
So I'm off.

268
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,874
Mr. Hastings, you're honest.
I can trust you.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,208
Well, I, uh...

270
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,874
Look after her, Mr. Hastings.
My poor Emily.

271
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,249
They're a lot of sharks.
All of them.

272
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,166
Of course I'll do everything
I can, Miss Howard.

273
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,374
I only ask you
to keep your eyes open.

274
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:51,999
Above all, Mr. Hastings,
watch that devil.

275
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,916
It's almost too hot, isn't it?

276
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:04,749
Too hot?

277
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,666
I shouldn't be surprised
if we had a thunderstorm.

278
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,083
That'll be 2 and threepence,
please, sir.

279
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,249
And don't you go telling anyone
about that, sir.

280
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
There's them 'round here
who'd do more than murder

281
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,416
for that much cocoa in one week.

282
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,708
I am very grateful to you,
Mme. Dainty.

283
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,083
And I give you my word

284
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,666
that I will be
the soul of discretion.

285
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

286
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,583
Mme. Dainty, has it
ever occurred to you

287
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,916
to organize the goods
by the country of origin?

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,666
Well, no, I-I can't say it has.

289
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,541
Ah, you would be amazed, madame.

290
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,416
Now, let me see.

291
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,958
North, south, east, west.

292
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:00,708
Yes.

293
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,458
The spices which come
from the Orient

294
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:04,708
we could place over there
by the door,

295
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,124
which represents the East, eh?

296
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,208
Voilà.

297
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:15,583
All you would need to remember
is from where came each article

298
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,083
to lay your hand on it
quickly and with efficiency.

299
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:19,666
I can do that already, sir.

300
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,708
And, anyway,
as far as I'm concerned,

301
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,291
everything comes
from the wholesaler.

302
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,624
In Malmesbury.

303
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,416
Ah, yes, Mme. Dainty, but --

304
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,499
-Half a dozen stamps, please.
-Very good, sir.

305
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,124
Hastings?

306
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,791
Good Lord!
M. Poirot!

307
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,333
It is indeed mon ami Hastings!

308
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,624
I was talking about you
only the other day.

309
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,041
Oh, mon ami, mon ami!

310
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,666
This is my old friend M. Poirot.
We haven't met for --

311
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,041
We know M. Poirot.

312
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,958
I didn't know
he was a friend of yours.

313
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:10,708
Oh, well, it is only by
the charity of Mme. Inglethorp,

314
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,833
the mother to M. Lawrence,
that I am here.

315
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:15,583
She has kindly extended
her hospitality to, what,

316
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,333
seven of my countrypeople

317
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,666
who are refugees
from our native land.

318
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,416
En effet, she has provided us

319
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,541
with a delightful house
over there.

320
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,499
You must come to the house.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Pardon.

321
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,333
You must come to tea.

322
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Now, that is the proper
English expression, no?

323
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,708
Yes, very proper.

324
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,624
Bon.
I improve, eh?

325
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,291
Excuse me.

326
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,666
-Oh, M. Poirot.
-Oh!

327
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,249
Mme. Raikes.

328
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,374
I told you before!

329
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,666
None of your own business.

330
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,333
It is my business!

331
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:05,083
Not content with carrying on
a sordid affair with this woman,

332
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:08,166
I now find you are squandering
large sums of money on her!

333
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,208
It's not a large sum of money.

334
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,916
And it was a loan, anyway!

335
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:14,291
No, no!
My mind is made up!

336
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,916
And you need not think
that any fear of scandal

337
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,791
between husband and wife
will deter me!

338
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,583
I have fed you and clothed you.

339
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,833
I've given you a roof
over your head,

340
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,916
and this is the way
you repay me!

341
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,333
He's such a dear little man.

342
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,499
You've been entertaining
a celebrity unawares.

343
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:35,916
Oh, it's you.

344
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,999
Is there anything the matter,
Aunt Emily?

345
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,374
Of course not!

346
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,249
Oh, uh, Dorcas,
bring me some stamps, will you?

347
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,583
Yes'm. You're looking
awfully tired, ma'am.

348
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:45,874
Didn't you ought to be resting?

349
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,249
Yes. No! Not now!

350
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,458
I've some letters I must finish
before post time.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,583
Have you lighted the fire
in my bedroom?

352
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,958
Yes'm.

353
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:58,291
I'll go to bed
directly after supper.

354
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:04,958
Then you won't show it to me?

355
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,416
My dear Mary, this has
nothing to do with the matter.

356
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,749
Show it to me, then!

357
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,874
I tell you,
it is not what you imagine!

358
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,958
It does not concern you
in the least.

359
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,708
I say, there's been
a most frightful row.

360
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,624
I got it all out of Dorcas.

361
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,583
Yes, I know. I just overheard
Mary and Mrs. Inglethorp.

362
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,499
No!
Between Aunt Emily and him.

363
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,666
Oh, I do hope
she's found him out at last.

364
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,999
I'm sure he's a fortune-hunter.

365
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,249
Well, Dorcas happened to be
near the door.

366
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,249
Apparently, it was
a real old bust-up.

367
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,333
Oh, I wish I knew
what it was all about.

368
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,916
-Where are you going?
-Just down to the village.

369
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,291
You're going to see

370
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,124
your precious Mrs. Raikes,
aren't you?

371
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,624
For God's sake, Mary!

372
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,083
I warn you, John --

373
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,791
I'm not gonna stand for this
much longer.

374
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,624
I'll have my coffee in my room.

375
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,958
I still have some papers
to see to.

376
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,624
I read in the newspaper

377
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,916
the first American divisions
are due in France next week.

378
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:09,374
Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp
her coffee, Cynthia?

379
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,333
Shall we have our coffee
in the drawing room?

380
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,666
Come in.

381
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,166
Put it by the bed, dear.

382
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,374
I'm turning in soon, too.
I'm exhausted.

383
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,999
I'll take some sleeping powders,
I think.

384
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,041
Just light the lamp
before you go.

385
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,541
Yes.

386
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,624
It will be dark soon.

387
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,291
Oh, no.

388
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:11,874
Oh.

389
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:17,249
Thank you, Dorcas.

390
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,291
I have to go down
to the village.

391
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,624
To see our agent
about those estate accounts.

392
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,374
And no one need sit up for me.

393
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,458
I'll take the latchkey.

394
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,624
Dashed funny time of night
to go and see Denby.

395
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,999
Mother!

396
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,124
Mother!

397
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,708
Mother!

398
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,041
Mother!

399
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,833
Mother!

400
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,749
Open the door!

401
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,791
Mother!

402
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,208
Mother!

403
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:48,916
Open the door!

404
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,833
-What are we gonna do?
-What's the matter?

405
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:52,458
Mother seems to be having
some kind of fit.

406
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,666
She's locked herself in, though.

407
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,458
Try going through
Mr. Inglethorp's room, sir.

408
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:57,999
Oh, Alfred.

409
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,124
Alfred.

410
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,541
Alfred!

411
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:04,791
Locked.

412
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,166
Oh, the poor mistress.

413
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,791
Let's try
and break the door down.

414
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:09,999
Beth, go and get Dr. Wilkins
at once.

415
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,083
There's a door on the other side
from Cynthia's room.

416
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,499
But it'll be bolted, sir.

417
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,124
Worth a try.

418
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:22,416
-Mary!
-Have you got the door open yet?

419
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,374
No.

420
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,916
That one's locked, too.

421
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,916
-Damn!
-I can't wake Cynthia.

422
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,999
She must have taken
a sleeping powder.

423
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,999
Cynthia!

424
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,166
Try again. 1, 2, 3.

425
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,624
-Once more. 1, 2, 3.
-Help me!

426
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,666
Annie, get some brandy
from the dining room.

427
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:57,374
Let us in.
I've managed to wake Cynthia.

428
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,583
-Are you all right?
-I took a sleeping powder.

429
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:01,874
What's the matter?

430
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,999
Oh, better now.

431
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,458
Very sudden.

432
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,583
Stupid of me.

433
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,541
Stupid of me to lock myself in.

434
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:16,166
It's all right.

435
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,083
It's all right.

436
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,083
Feeling a little better now.

437
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,166
Out of my way.
Out of my way.

438
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:51,249
Alfred.

439
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:03,249
No.

440
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,041
Is she dead?

441
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,374
Oh, God.

442
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,208
Where is Mr. Inglethorp?

443
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,916
He's not in the house.

444
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:56,874
Where is he?

445
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,874
Mr. Cavendish, I would like your
consent to a postmortem, then.

446
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,749
But that's not necessary.
Surely it was a heart attack.

447
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,124
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

448
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,749
Mrs. Inglethorp
showed classic symptoms

449
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,166
of strychnine poisoning.

450
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,208
That can't be.

451
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,999
Do whatever you think necessary,
Dr. Wilkins.

452
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,208
These are your mother's keys.

453
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,041
I've locked both the rooms.

454
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:33,583
I suggest they remain locked
for the time being.

455
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,541
You remember my speaking
of my friend Poirot --

456
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,333
the Belgian in the village?

457
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,541
Oh, the one
who used to be a detective?

458
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,416
Yes.

459
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:23,416
I want you to let me call him in
to investigate this business.

460
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,208
This is all rubbish, you know.

461
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,249
Wilkins has got a bee
in his bonnet about poisons.

462
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,291
Poisons are his hobby, so of
course he sees them everywhere.

463
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,416
I'm inclined to give Hastings
a free hand, Lawrence.

464
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,874
Though I should prefer
to wait a bit.

465
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,999
We don't want
unnecessary scandal.

466
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,041
No, no, no, no, no.

467
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,458
You need have no worry
about that.

468
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,833
Poirot is discretion itself.

469
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,041
All right.

470
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,249
No, John!

471
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,166
I'm sorry, Lawrence.

472
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,208
Dear God. This is terrible.
My poor wife.

473
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,916
Well, where have you been?

474
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,708
Denby kept me late last night.

475
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,499
Then I discovered
that I'd forgotten the latchkey.

476
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,124
Denby gave me a bed

477
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,458
so that I wouldn't have to
arouse the household.

478
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,916
Oh, my poor Emily.

479
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,874
She was so self-sacrificing.

480
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,083
She overtaxed herself.

481
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,083
Now I'd better get on my way.

482
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:45,333
Yes.
Yes, of course.

483
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,416
Oui?

484
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,916
M. Poirot.
Good morning.

485
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:21,083
Ah, Hastings!
You rise early.

486
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:24,583
Mrs. Inglethorp is dead.

487
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,416
One moment.

488
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,874
I am pleased with you, Hastings.

489
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,999
You have a good memory

490
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:51,249
and have given to me faithfully
the facts.

491
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,124
But of the order in which you
present them, I say nothing.

492
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,833
Truly, it is deplorable.

493
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,458
Oh, but I make allowances.
You are upset.

494
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:02,374
Later, when you are calmer,

495
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,541
we will
arrange the facts neatly,

496
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,166
each in his proper place.

497
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,083
And those of importance,
we will place on one side,

498
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,999
and those of no importance...

499
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:15,791
...we blow them away.

500
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,333
But whatever allowances I make,

501
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,749
I cannot escape the fact

502
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,249
that you have omitted
one piece of evidence

503
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,249
of the paramount importance.

504
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,124
And what's that?

505
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,249
You did not say to me

506
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,583
if Mme. Inglethorp
ate well last night.

507
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,833
Ah, well, as far as I can
remember, she hardly ate at all.

508
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:40,124
She was obviously upset, and it
had taken away her appetite.

509
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:42,416
I see.

510
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,583
Bien.

511
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,666
Uh, Hastings,
you dressed in haste.

512
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,374
Your tie is to one side.

513
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,458
One must not let oneself go,
Hastings.

514
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,041
Why did you want to know

515
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,416
if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well
last night?

516
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,833
The contention at the present

517
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:29,249
is that Mme. Inglethorp died
of the strychnine poisoning, no?

518
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,624
It looked like it to me.

519
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,208
Bon.

520
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:34,999
At what time did Mme. Inglethorp
retire for the night?

521
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,416
Oh, very early.
About 8:00.

522
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,124
And yet the symptoms
did not manifest themselves

523
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,749
until 5:00 in the morning.

524
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,124
Nine hours.

525
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,374
Now, a heavy meal taken at about
the same time as the poison

526
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,249
might retard its effect,
but hardly to that extent.

527
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,499
And you say to me
that Mme. Inglethorp

528
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,624
ate very little for supper.

529
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,166
Yes.

530
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,041
Hmm.

531
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,458
One of those
curious little facts, mon ami.

532
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,083
We put it here.

533
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:13,374
This is a very dreadful
business, M. Poirot.

534
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,749
Hastings has explained

535
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,958
that we're anxious
to avoid publicity.

536
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:18,791
I comprehend perfectly.

537
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,249
You know Inglethorp's back?

538
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:22,708
Yes, I met him.

539
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,499
It's damn difficult
to know how to treat him.

540
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,958
That difficulty
will not exist for long.

541
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,166
The key to the room,
if you please, monsieur.

542
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,916
Oh, of course.

543
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:38,999
Merci.

544
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:11,999
Hastings, we must leave this

545
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,833
until the lawyer
of Mme. Inglethorp is present.

546
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,666
This goes through
to Cynthia's room.

547
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,208
What is it?

548
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,166
We shall see.

549
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,874
I think that this is cocoa,
mon ami,

550
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,416
but we will now send it
for analysis.

551
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,333
Ah.

552
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,333
Regardes, mon ami.

553
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,083
The chimney piece of the lamp
is broken in two places only,

554
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:45,999
and yet the coffee cup
next to it

555
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,291
is ground almost to the powder.

556
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,416
I suppose somebody
must have stepped on it.

557
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,791
Yes, mon ami.

558
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,541
Somebody must have stepped
on that coffee cup

559
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,666
and ground it
almost to the powder.

560
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,624
And the reason that they did so

561
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,583
was either because
it contained the strychnine

562
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,583
or -- which is
far more serious --

563
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,833
because it did not contain
the strychnine.

564
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,374
I wonder what is that.

565
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:34,249
Hmm. This, I think, is a coffee
stain that is quite fresh.

566
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:36,916
Eh bien, Hastings,

567
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,624
we have in this room
now six points of interest.

568
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,541
Shall I catalog them
or will you?

569
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,666
Oh.

570
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,124
Uh... well, um, you.

571
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,874
Very well.

572
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,958
Number one, a coffee cup that is
ground almost to the powder.

573
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,583
Number two, the dispatch case
with the key in the lock.

574
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:59,041
Number three, the coffee stain
on the carpet.

575
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,333
Number four, a thread or two
of dark-green material

576
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,583
caught on the bolt of that door.

577
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,958
Ah, that's what you put
in the envelope.

578
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,499
Oui. D'accord.

579
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,166
And number five, this.

580
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,458
What is it?

581
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,249
Candle grease, my friend.

582
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,791
It must have dropped
to the floor since yesterday.

583
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,874
Otherwise, the good housemaid
would have removed it.

584
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,874
Lawrence Cavendish
brought a candle

585
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,749
into the room this morning.

586
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,874
He seemed very agitated.

587
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,041
He seemed
to see something over there

588
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,208
that absolutely paralyzed him.

589
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:33,958
At the door, do you think?

590
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:35,624
No, at the fireplace.

591
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,416
That is most interesting,
mon ami.

592
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,999
But his candle, it is pink.

593
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,541
And that candle grease
over there, it is white.

594
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,916
And the sixth point?

595
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:48,708
No, the sixth point I prefer to
keep to myself at the present.

596
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,916
Alors, there is nothing more
to do here, I think.

597
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,041
Unless...

598
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:02,541
A bedroom fire in midsummer,
Hastings?

599
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:16,458
The fire warms,
but it also destroys.

600
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,833
There might be...

601
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:22,624
Ah!

602
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,708
Voilà!

603
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:30,124
What do you think of that,
mon ami?

604
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,416
Very thick paper.

605
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,874
Much thicker
than ordinary writing paper.

606
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,249
And?

607
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:37,624
A will.

608
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,499
This could be a fragment
of a will.

609
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,124
That could be
"will and testament."

610
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,833
Exactement.

611
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,791
Just as I expected.

612
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,291
Tell me, mademoiselle,

613
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,416
did your mistress
have in her wardrobe

614
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,916
a dress that is dark green?

615
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,041
No, sir.

616
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,499
Does anyone in the house possess
a dress that is dark green?

617
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:00,708
No, sir.
Not that I know of.

618
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:03,624
Very well.

619
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,208
We will leave that and pass on.

620
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,958
I would like to ask you,
if I may,

621
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,791
one or two questions about
the afternoon of yesterday.

622
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,166
Yes, sir.

623
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,999
Your mistress --
She had a quarrel?

624
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,624
I don't know that I ought --

625
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,416
My good Dorcas,
Mme. Inglethorp lies dead,

626
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:27,041
and it is necessary
that we must know all

627
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,749
if we are to avenge her.

628
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,208
Amen to that, sir.

629
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,374
Uh, naming no names,

630
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,791
there's one in this house
none of us could ever abide.

631
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,166
Ah.

632
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:46,624
Now, as to this quarrel...

633
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,208
It was about 4:00.

634
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:54,749
I happened to be passing
the study, and I heard voices --

635
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:59,958
loud, angry ones --
coming from there.

636
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:02,249
I didn't mean to listen.

637
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:07,499
Continue, mademoiselle.
What happened next?

638
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:11,499
At 5:00,
Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell

639
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:14,791
and told me to bring her
a cup of tea.

640
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:24,249
She looked dreadful, sir.

641
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,249
Your tea, mum.

642
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,749
I've had a great shock, Dorcas.

643
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,791
I'm sorry for that, mum.

644
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:34,833
I don't know what to do.

645
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:39,791
Scandal between a husband
and wife is a dreadful thing.

646
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:43,291
These few words
and everything's changed.

647
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:49,166
Never trust a man, Dorcas.
They're not worth it.

648
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:55,291
Tell me, mademoiselle,

649
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,791
this paper
that she had in her hand --

650
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:01,166
What would she likely do with it
afterwards, do you think?

651
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:04,499
I expect she'd lock it up
in that purple case of hers.

652
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,291
If it was important.

653
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,291
I see.

654
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,874
Tell me, mademoiselle,
do you think it likely

655
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,666
that your mistress
would have taken

656
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:17,999
a sleeping powder last night?

657
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,333
Not last night, sir.
I know she didn't.

658
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,999
She took the last dose
of her tonic,

659
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,166
but she never took
a sleeping powder.

660
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,874
How is that you're so positive?

661
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,874
The box was empty, sir.

662
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,833
She took the last one
two days ago.

663
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,458
And she didn't have
any more made up.

664
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:02,249
Oh, Miss Howard.
It's so good to see you again.

665
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,999
Terrible time
to come back, Dorcas.

666
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:08,749
Evie.

667
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:14,499
Started the moment
I got the wire.

668
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:23,333
Dorcas will make us some tea.

669
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:25,249
I don't want tea.

670
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,708
Ah, here's Mr. Poirot.

671
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,624
Mr. Poirot's helping us
with our investigation.

672
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,458
Nothing to investigate!

673
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,374
Have they taken him
to prison yet?

674
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,708
Taken who to prison?

675
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,791
Alfred Inglethorp, of course.

676
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:39,166
Poor Emily was never murdered
till he came along!

677
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:41,708
Evie, don't shout so.

678
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,708
Whatever we may think
or suspect,

679
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,583
it's better to say as little
as possible for the present.

680
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,041
The inquest isn't until Friday.

681
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,499
Inquest? Fiddlesticks.

682
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,749
The man will be
out of the country by then!

683
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,208
He won't stay here
tamely waiting to be hanged.

684
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:56,166
Mademoiselle...

685
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,874
It's no good trying all that.

686
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:00,916
Mr. Alfred Inglethorp
is going to hang!

687
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,041
Even if I have to drag him
to the gallows myself!

688
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:19,583
How did you know
that Mrs. Inglethorp

689
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:20,708
took sleeping powders?

690
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,416
Ah, because, Hastings,

691
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:26,166
I found this in the drawer of
the wash stand in her bedroom.

692
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:29,999
It was this that was
the number six of my catalog.

693
00:47:32,584 --> 00:47:34,666
But if the last powder
was taken two days ago,

694
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:35,958
it can't be that important.

695
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:37,333
Probably not.

696
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,291
Mr. Poirot,
my mother's lawyer is here.

697
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:48,208
I don't know
if you'd like to talk to him.

698
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:50,291
He's also the coroner,
you understand?

699
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:52,249
Yes.

700
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,916
Yes.
Thank you, M. Cavendish.

701
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,999
M. Wells, there is one thing
that I should like to ask you --

702
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,374
that is, if it is not against
the professional etiquette.

703
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:09,041
In the event of the death
of Mme. Inglethorp,

704
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,874
who would inherit her money?

705
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,916
It's all right.

706
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:19,499
By her last will,
dated two months ago,

707
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,833
she left this
and her house in London

708
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:27,249
to her eldest son,
Mr. John Cavendish.

709
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,124
The remainder of her fortune
goes to Mr. Inglethorp.

710
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:35,791
And suppose that, unknown to
you, she made a new will?

711
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,999
It's always possible, of course.

712
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,208
There was a new will.

713
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,124
-What?
-Where is it now?

714
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,624
Burned.

715
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,916
What an
extraordinary coincidence

716
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:54,791
that my mother
should have made a will

717
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,458
on the very day of her death.

718
00:48:57,917 --> 00:48:59,916
Are you so sure
it's a coincidence?

719
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:01,958
What do you mean?

720
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:05,333
Your mother, you tell me,
had a violent quarrel

721
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,666
with someone
yesterday afternoon.

722
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,666
And the consequence
of that quarrel?

723
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:12,583
She very suddenly and hurriedly
makes a new will.

724
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,499
She told no one
of its provisions.

725
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:22,958
The will disappears, and she
takes its secret to her grave.

726
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:27,291
I fear there is
no coincidence here.

727
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:30,624
What do you mean?

728
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,374
You've got the keys still,
haven't you, Mr. Poirot?

729
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,083
Oui. Voilà.

730
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:53,124
My mother kept some things
in this.

731
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,333
You will need the key because
I locked it this morning.

732
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,791
It's not locked now.

733
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:00,499
Mais c'est impossible.

734
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,833
But I have had the key
in my pocket for all of the day.

735
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:07,999
En voilà une affaire.

736
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,458
This lock, it has been forced.

737
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,749
This door, it is unbolted.

738
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:24,874
Why?

739
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,041
When?

740
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,833
There must have been something

741
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:31,874
of great importance
in that case.

742
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,499
Something that connected
the murderer with the crime.

743
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:35,874
-What?
-Ach!

744
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:38,999
That I do not know.

745
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:01,583
An intriguing case, this,
mon ami, do you not think?

746
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,708
It seems quite straightforward,
really.

747
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:06,749
Everything seems to be tied up
with Mrs. Inglethorp's money.

748
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,666
And her two houses, Hastings.

749
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,791
Well, yes.

750
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:14,124
They go to John, and everything
else goes to her husband.

751
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:16,499
But then they had
that dreadful row --

752
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:17,833
the one that Dorcas overhead --

753
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:19,874
and Mrs. Inglethorp
changes her will.

754
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,999
And what about her two sons,
Hastings?

755
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,249
Oh, no. I don't imagine
they're involved.

756
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,666
No, what happens is,

757
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,833
Inglethorp finds out
that the will has been changed,

758
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,083
leaving everything to her son
rather than him,

759
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:32,541
and poisons her.

760
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,249
-And the new will she has made?
-He burns it.

761
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:39,166
That was the scrap of paper
we found in her bedroom grate.

762
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:42,083
Ah. You have a good grip
on this affair, Hastings.

763
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:44,791
-Grasp.
-Yes?

764
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,374
You know, Hastings,
there are in this case

765
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,583
only two points
of any significance.

766
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:55,458
Oh, really?
What are they?

767
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:00,458
The first is the state
of the weather on Tuesday.

768
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,749
But it was a beautiful day.

769
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,416
Must have been
80 degrees in the shade.

770
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:04,666
Not a cloud in the sky.

771
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,333
Do not forget that, mon ami.

772
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:07,791
It is the key
to the whole riddle.

773
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,124
I don't see why.

774
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,999
All right, then.
What's the second point?

775
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,291
The second point
is the important fact

776
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:15,833
that M. Inglethorp
wore the peculiar clothes,

777
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:18,208
wears the black beard,
and uses the spectacles.

778
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:19,249
That's ridiculous.

779
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,291
No, mon ami.
It is momentous.

780
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:25,541
Dr. Wilkins, can you tell us

781
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,374
exactly how much poison
Mrs. Inglethorp had consumed?

782
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,916
Judging from
the amount recovered,

783
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:34,291
Mrs. Inglethorp had ingested

784
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,666
about three-quarters
of a grain of strychnine,

785
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:38,041
possibly a grain.

786
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,624
I took a sample of the cocoa
remaining in the cup

787
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,208
in Mrs. Inglethorp's room.

788
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:45,999
There was no strychnine in it.

789
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,583
Then you consider it more likely

790
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,166
that the drug was administered
in her after-dinner coffee

791
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,874
and that,
for some reason unknown,

792
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,916
its action was delayed?

793
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:02,458
Yes.

794
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,958
But the coffee cup
was so completely smashed,

795
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:08,416
there was no possibility
of analyzing its contents.

796
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,833
It seems to me
that my mother's death

797
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:15,083
may be accounted for
by natural means.

798
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:16,458
Really?

799
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,249
Well, my mother was,
for some time before her death,

800
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,791
taking a tonic
containing strychnine.

801
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:24,874
That was dealt with
in previous evidence.

802
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:27,791
But is it not possible
that she may have taken

803
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,208
an overdose of the medicine
by accident?

804
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:32,333
I think not, Mr. Cavendish.

805
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:35,458
The maid, Dorcas,
has already told us

806
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:39,374
she had only one dose left
on the day before her death.

807
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,041
I should be obliged
if you would tell us

808
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,499
all you overheard of the quarrel

809
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:47,958
the day before
Mrs. Inglethorp's death.

810
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:49,916
I overheard?

811
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:52,958
Yes.

812
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:55,916
I understand you were sitting,

813
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:59,166
reading on a bench outside
the open window of the study.

814
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,083
Is that not so?

815
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:04,958
Yes.

816
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:09,749
Will you repeat what
you overheard of the quarrel?

817
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:14,249
I really don't remember
hearing anything.

818
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,541
You mean to say
you did not hear voices?

819
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:21,874
W-Well, yes.

820
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:24,333
I heard the voices.

821
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:27,499
But I didn't hear
what they said.

822
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:31,374
Not one stray word or phrase?

823
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,666
Yes. I remember.

824
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:40,708
Mrs. Inglethorp said something.

825
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:44,833
Something about
causing a scandal

826
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:46,666
between husband and wife.

827
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,499
She sounds as if
she's trying to hide something.

828
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,708
-That is true, Hastings...
-Call Mr. Mace.

829
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,416
...and is of some interest.

830
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,458
I swear by almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

831
00:55:06,584 --> 00:55:08,499
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

832
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,458
and nothing but the truth.

833
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,041
Mr. Mace, as a qualified
dispensing chemist

834
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:22,083
with a shop in the village
of Styles St. Mary,

835
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:28,041
have you lately sold strychnine
to any unauthorized person?

836
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,291
Yes, sir.

837
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,541
When was this?

838
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,499
M-Monday, the 18th of June.

839
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,208
At about 6:00.

840
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:44,208
Would you tell us to whom
you sold it?

841
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,916
Yes, sir.

842
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,083
It was Mr. Inglethorp.

843
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:52,124
He -- He said
it was to poison a dog.

844
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,541
He signed the poison book
and everything.

845
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,333
Very well.

846
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:09,749
Thank you, Mr. Mace.

847
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,166
Call Mr. Alfred Inglethorp.

848
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,499
I swear by almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

849
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,749
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

850
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,874
and nothing but the truth.

851
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:51,208
-Are you Alfred Inglethorp?
-Yes.

852
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,208
On Monday evening last,

853
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:58,166
did you purchase strychnine for
the purpose of poisoning a dog?

854
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:00,458
No.
I did not.

855
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,124
There is no dog at Styles Court.

856
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:07,583
Do you also deny
that you signed this register?

857
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:12,124
Yes.

858
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:23,333
Hmm.
That is not my signature.

859
00:57:24,834 --> 00:57:26,791
I see.

860
00:57:28,209 --> 00:57:30,999
Would you mind telling us,
Mr. Inglethorp, where you were

861
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,416
on the evening
of Monday, June the 18th?

862
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:34,791
I don't recall.

863
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,041
Were you in company with anyone?

864
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,166
No.

865
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,166
I am to take it, then, that you
decline to say where you were

866
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:49,374
at the time that Mr. Mace
positively recognized you

867
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,416
as entering the shop
to purchase strychnine?

868
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:54,666
If you'd like to take it
that way, yes.

869
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,458
Does he want to be arrested?

870
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:02,041
You had a discussion with
your wife on Tuesday afternoon.

871
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:04,166
Pardon me.
You are misinformed.

872
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,833
I had no quarrel
with my dear wife.

873
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:12,249
I was absent from the house
the entire afternoon.

874
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:15,624
Have you anyone
who can testify to that?

875
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:18,958
You have my word.

876
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,333
There are two witnesses
who have sworn

877
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,916
to having overheard
your disagreement

878
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:27,291
with Mrs. Inglethorp.

879
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:31,166
Then those witnesses
are mistaken.

880
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,874
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Inglethorp.

881
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,833
That will be all for now.

882
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:50,833
Members of the jury...

883
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,166
He's put a noose
right 'round his neck.

884
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,999
Perhaps.

885
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,749
Hastings, do you know
who is that man by the door?

886
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:02,124
...of Dr. Wilkins that
the deceased, Mrs. Inglethorp...

887
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,083
That is Detective Inspector
James Japp from Scotland Yard.

888
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,541
And if I am not mistaken,

889
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:09,666
the man next to him
is also from Scotland Yard.

890
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,416
Things are moving quickly,
my friend.

891
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:15,208
Perhaps too quickly.

892
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:21,666
Gentlemen of the jury...

893
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:23,916
How do you find?

894
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,249
Willful murder by some person
or persons unknown.

895
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,833
And is that the verdict
of you all?

896
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,291
It is.

897
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:44,624
Mon Dieu. I had some warm
moments in the court, Hastings.

898
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,958
I did not figure to myself that
the man would be so pigheaded

899
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,999
as to refuse to say
anything at all.

900
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:53,041
I can't understand why the jury
didn't name Inglethorp.

901
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,249
You surely can't still believe
he's innocent.

902
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:57,583
Why not, mon ami?
Nothing has changed.

903
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,416
Ah.

904
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,541
I see you do not remember me,
Inspector Japp.

905
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:05,499
Well, if it isn't M. Poirot.

906
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:09,249
This is
Superintendent Summerhaye.

907
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,166
You've heard me speak
of M. Poirot, sir.

908
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,208
Yes, the Abercrombie
forgery case, wasn't it?

909
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:14,833
-Just before the war.
-That's right, sir.

910
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,624
M. Poirot caught our villain
for us in Antwerp.

911
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,874
What are you doing
in England, Poirot?

912
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,124
The Boche has made my own
country temporarily unhabitable

913
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,208
by their presence, Inspector.

914
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:28,833
But I would like you to meet
my friend Lieutenant Hastings.

915
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,833
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

916
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:32,874
Excuse us.

917
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,083
Well, one need
hardly ask the reason

918
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:37,041
for your presence here,
Inspector.

919
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,249
No.
Pretty clear case, I should say.

920
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,916
There I differ from you.

921
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,999
From the evidence I heard
at the inquest,

922
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,666
Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife
as sure as I'm standing here.

923
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:48,124
I don't know, sir.

924
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,083
Me and M. Poirot
have met before,

925
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:53,333
and there's no man's judgment
I'd sooner take than his.

926
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,833
If I'm not greatly mistaken,

927
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:57,291
he's got something
up his sleeve.

928
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,166
Well, I will tell you this --

929
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:02,708
If you arrest
M. Alfred Inglethorp,

930
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,708
it will bring you no kudos.

931
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:07,749
The case against him
will be dismissed comme ça.

932
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:11,124
I'd take your word, but there's
others above me might not.

933
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,416
Me, for one.

934
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,541
Alfred Inglethorp must not
be arrested, Superintendent.

935
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,458
That I have sworn.

936
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,916
Have you ever been
to New York, Hastings?

937
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,291
New York? No.

938
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:47,374
It is a beautiful city.

939
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,124
Beautiful.

940
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,791
There each street is
at right angles to each avenue,

941
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:57,124
and each avenue is numbered
nicely -- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

942
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:58,708
Man is in command there.

943
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:02,624
But here, how does one live
with the fact that, au fond,

944
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:06,666
nature is untidy, uncontrolled,
anarchic, inefficient?

945
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:10,124
But that's what I like about it.

946
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,708
Hastings, did it not strike you
as peculiar

947
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,999
that M. Lawrence Cavendish
has suggested

948
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,666
that his mother might have
been poisoned by accident?

949
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:25,499
Oh, it seemed quite a natural
suggestion for a layman to make.

950
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:26,624
But he is not a layman.

951
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,999
You have told me yourself that
he has a degree in medicine.

952
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,124
Yes, that's true.
I'd forgotten about that.

953
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,458
And then there is
also Mme. Cavendish.

954
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,541
What did you make
of her attitude?

955
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,541
Well, it seems inconceivable

956
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,374
that she should be
shielding Inglethorp,

957
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,958
but that's what it looked like.

958
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:43,333
Oui. D'accord.

959
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:47,624
A great deal that was peculiar
showed itself today.

960
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,749
Where are we going, Poirot?

961
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,291
To see the beautiful
Mme. Raikes, Hastings.

962
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:56,874
She's an absolute corker,
you know.

963
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:01,666
Thank you.

964
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,624
No, no, no, no, no, Hastings.

965
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,124
I am going to see
the beautiful Mme. Raikes.

966
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,958
You, I fear,
are far too impressionable

967
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,249
for this particular task.

968
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:25,249
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

969
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,333
I'll go out the back way.

970
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:41,333
Bonjour, Mme. Raikes.

971
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,458
We'd like you
to come into Malmesbury

972
01:03:51,584 --> 01:03:52,916
with us, Mr. Inglethorp.

973
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,291
Malmesbury?

974
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:55,708
To the station.

975
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:58,374
You're arresting him, are you?
About time to.

976
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,333
We'd just like Mr. Inglethorp to
answer a few questions, madame.

977
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,249
Madame.

978
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,833
One moment, if you please,
Inspector Japp.

979
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,416
Now, you just leave well alone,
Mr. Poirot.

980
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,166
Sorry, M. Poirot.

981
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:19,249
I understand.

982
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,541
Superintendent, I beg of you to
allow me to ask to M. Inglethorp

983
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,374
just one question.

984
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:32,999
Go on, then.

985
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:35,416
Thank you, Superintendent.

986
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,791
M. Inglethorp, do you still
refuse to say where you were

987
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,999
at 6:00 on Monday afternoon?

988
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,124
Speak.

989
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:52,041
Very well.
Then I must speak for you.

990
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,749
You? How can you?

991
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:56,791
I speak.

992
01:04:57,959 --> 01:04:59,208
Listen!

993
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:01,708
I, Hercule Poirot, affirm

994
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:04,999
that the man who bought
the strychnine poison

995
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:08,666
on Monday afternoon at 6:00
was not Alfred Inglethorp.

996
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:11,374
For at 6:00 on that day,

997
01:05:12,334 --> 01:05:16,583
M. Alfred Inglethorp
was at Tadminster.

998
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,541
I can produce
no less than five witnesses

999
01:05:25,209 --> 01:05:28,333
who swear to have seen him
and to have spoken to him there

1000
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:30,333
at 6:00 or just after.

1001
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:32,916
And, as you may know,

1002
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:36,041
Tadminster is at least
eight miles from the village.

1003
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,249
My word, Poirot.
You're the goods.

1004
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:40,666
Didn't I tell you, sir?

1005
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:45,666
These witnesses of yours
are all right, I suppose?

1006
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,166
Voilà.

1007
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:51,166
I have made a catalog of them.
Names and addresses.

1008
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:54,708
You will find them all
perfectly genuine.

1009
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,541
They even include
the charming Mme. Raikes.

1010
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,041
Didn't I tell you, sir?

1011
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:39,583
So we're back
to square one, then.

1012
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,291
Well, not quite, mon ami.

1013
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:44,791
We now know there is one person
who did not buy the poison.

1014
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,791
Eh bien, we have cleared away
the clues manufactured.

1015
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:49,208
Now for the real ones.

1016
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:11,083
"...is cut down, like a flower;

1017
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,458
he fleeth as it were a shadow,

1018
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,333
and never continueth
in one stay.

1019
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,083
In the midst of life
we are in death:

1020
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:24,124
of whom may we seek for succor,
but of thee, O Lord,

1021
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,874
who for our sins
art justly displeased?

1022
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,999
Yet, O Lord God most holy,
O Lord most mighty,

1023
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:38,208
O holy
and most merciful Savior,

1024
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:45,249
deliver us not into the bitter
pains of eternal death."

1025
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,666
-Lieutenant Hastings, sir?
-Yes, Dorcas?

1026
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:55,083
I know this is hardly
the time or the place,

1027
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:57,541
but you remember
this foreign gentleman

1028
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,458
particularly asked
if my mistress

1029
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:03,041
or anyone else in the house
had got a green dress?

1030
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:04,166
Yes. Go on.

1031
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:05,541
I've just remembered --

1032
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,874
what the young gentleman
used to call a dressing-up box.

1033
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,833
It's up in the front attic.

1034
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:30,208
This is green.

1035
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,249
No, it is too dark.

1036
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:41,666
Good Lord.

1037
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:45,333
Aha.

1038
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:49,999
Hold it up to your face,
Hastings.

1039
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,833
Do you think it's the one?

1040
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,124
I do.

1041
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,583
It is trimmed
exactly to the same shape

1042
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,291
as the beard of M. Inglethorp.

1043
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:14,874
The question is,
who put it there?

1044
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:20,958
Someone with a great deal
of intelligence, Hastings.

1045
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,791
He chose to hide it
in the one place

1046
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,541
where its presence
would not be remarked.

1047
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,333
But we must be
even more intelligent.

1048
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,833
We must be so intelligent

1049
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:35,708
that he does not suspect us
of being intelligent at all.

1050
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:36,874
Absolutely.

1051
01:09:38,042 --> 01:09:40,416
And there you will be
invaluable, mon ami.

1052
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:41,999
Come.

1053
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:03,791
Well, he took the hint at last.

1054
01:10:04,584 --> 01:10:05,833
Comment?

1055
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,249
He's moved out.

1056
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:10,583
Gone to the hotel at Malmesbury.

1057
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,124
-Oh, Lieutenant Hastings.
-Hello, Cynthia.

1058
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,374
Just the man I was looking for.
I want to talk to you.

1059
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,499
Can I steal him away from you,
Mr. Poirot?

1060
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:52,874
Steal him away?

1061
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,708
Ah! Pardon. Yes.

1062
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,458
By all means, Mlle. Murdoch.

1063
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,333
Hastings, how I envy you, eh?

1064
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:04,124
To be stealed away
by such a charming young lady.

1065
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:07,291
Excuse me.

1066
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:13,041
What do you want to talk about?

1067
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,458
Let's sit down first, shall we?

1068
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:16,166
Oh. Right.

1069
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,833
Lieutenant Hastings...

1070
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,791
You've always been so kind.

1071
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:36,166
And you know such a lot.

1072
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,041
Oh. Well.

1073
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:41,624
You know.

1074
01:11:42,917 --> 01:11:45,166
I want to ask your advice.

1075
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:52,083
You see, Aunt Emily always said
I should be provided for.

1076
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,458
Well, I suppose she forgot.

1077
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:59,833
Or didn't think
she was likely to die.

1078
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:05,958
Anyway, I'm not provided for.

1079
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:09,916
I don't know what to do.

1080
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,041
Do you think I ought to
go away from here?

1081
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,541
Oh, good heavens, no.

1082
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:18,624
They don't want to part
with you, I'm sure.

1083
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,249
Mary does.
She hates me.

1084
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:23,041
-Hates you?
-I don't know why.

1085
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,166
And he can't bear me, either.

1086
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:28,041
Oh, well, now,
there I know you're wrong.

1087
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,374
John's very fond of you.

1088
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,749
Oh, yes, not John.

1089
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:33,333
I meant Lawrence.

1090
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:36,916
Not that I care whether Lawrence
hates me or not.

1091
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,124
Still...

1092
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,124
It's rather horrid when no one
loves you, isn't it?

1093
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,499
But they do, Cynthia.

1094
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,833
I'm sure you're mistaken.

1095
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,333
There's John and Miss Howard.

1096
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:53,416
Lawrence never speaks to me
if he can help it.

1097
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:55,458
And Mary
can hardly bring herself

1098
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,166
to be civil to me, and...

1099
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,041
I don't know
what to do.

1100
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:11,374
Marry me, Cynthia.

1101
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:12,874
Oh!

1102
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:15,208
Oh, don't be silly.

1103
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:16,708
I'm not being silly.

1104
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,874
I'm asking you to do me
the honor of becoming my wife.

1105
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,249
Oh, that's perfectly sweet
of you.

1106
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:27,166
I don't think
there's anything to laugh at.

1107
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:29,624
There's nothing funny
about a proposal of marriage.

1108
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,791
No, there isn't.

1109
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:33,916
And you ought to be careful.

1110
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:38,458
Because somebody might
accept you next time.

1111
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:42,708
Goodbye, Lieutenant Hastings.

1112
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:46,291
You've cheered me up no end.

1113
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:54,166
I don't know.

1114
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:57,374
Perhaps I just don't
understand women or something.

1115
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,333
No.
I'm just joking, of course.

1116
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,124
It's Inspector Japp.

1117
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:16,999
Hastings, who is that with him
in the back of the car?

1118
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,958
Looks like Lawrence Cavendish.

1119
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,874
What's the matter, Dorcas?

1120
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,999
Those wicked detectives.

1121
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:40,541
They've arrested Mr. Cavendish!

1122
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,124
Arrested Lawrence?

1123
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,666
No, not Mr. Lawrence.

1124
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,666
Mr. John!

1125
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,999
Old Bailey murder trial!

1126
01:15:03,334 --> 01:15:04,583
Read all about it!

1127
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,416
Cavendish in dock!

1128
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,999
Old Bailey murder trial!

1129
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:37,374
John Wendover Cavendish,

1130
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,374
you are charged
with murder of your mother,

1131
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,291
Mrs. Emily Rose Inglethorp,

1132
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:43,833
on Tuesday,
the 19th day of June, 1917.

1133
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,749
How do you plead?

1134
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:50,083
Not guilty.

1135
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:57,208
Members of the jury,
as you all know,

1136
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,458
willful murder
is a hanging matter,

1137
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,041
and the murder
which you will hear described

1138
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,041
is a most horrible,
premeditated,

1139
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,874
and cold-blooded one.

1140
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:18,541
The poisoning of a fond and
trusting woman by her own son.

1141
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:23,958
The accused and his wife
lived in some luxury

1142
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:27,208
at his mother's house,
Styles Court.

1143
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,791
Entirely supported by her,

1144
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:34,083
Mrs. Inglethorp had been their
kind and generous benefactress.

1145
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:37,166
I will call witnesses
to show how the prisoner

1146
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,124
was at the end
of his financial tether.

1147
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,166
You will also hear
how the accused

1148
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:45,749
had been carrying on an intrigue

1149
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,666
with a certain Mrs. Raikes,
a local farmer's widow,

1150
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:52,583
and how he had plotted
to get his mother

1151
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,624
to make a will in his favor
and how,

1152
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:58,041
when he believed
that she had changed that will,

1153
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:01,374
he murdered her
and destroyed the new one.

1154
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,749
You will hear...

1155
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,624
I cannot bring myself to listen
to any more of this, Hastings.

1156
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,333
It sounds very bad,
n'est-ce pas?

1157
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:12,166
It'll probably sound better
when the defense gets going.

1158
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:15,291
I don't know how Mary Cavendish
can bear to sit there.

1159
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:17,333
Ah, well,
she is one of those women

1160
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:19,999
who show at their best
in adversity.

1161
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,041
Her jealousy
and her pride have --

1162
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,916
-Jealousy?
-Yes.

1163
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:25,791
Have you not yet realized,
Hastings,

1164
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:28,708
that Mme. Cavendish is a woman
of unusual jealousy?

1165
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,541
You overheard the fragment
of conversation

1166
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,124
that she had
with her mother-in-law

1167
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,999
when she demanded
that Mme. Inglethorp

1168
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,291
show to her something?

1169
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,666
Yes.

1170
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,583
Mme. Cavendish believed

1171
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:41,041
that the letter
her mother-in-law was concealing

1172
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,958
was proof of the infidelity
of her husband, John.

1173
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,833
But she was wrong, Hastings.
There was no such letter.

1174
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:52,666
What Mme. Inglethorp
had discovered...

1175
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:56,291
...was that her son John
had loaned to Mme. Raikes --

1176
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:59,333
and I heard this from
Mme. Raikes herself, Hastings --

1177
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:01,374
had loaned her
a large sum of money

1178
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,208
in order that Mme. Raikes
might purchase

1179
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:05,041
the freehold of her cottage.

1180
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,249
You deny that there was
anything improper

1181
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,833
in your relationship
with John Cavendish.

1182
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:13,708
Yes.

1183
01:18:13,834 --> 01:18:15,083
I see.

1184
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:18,958
Did you receive money
from Mr. Cavendish?

1185
01:18:19,584 --> 01:18:21,041
No.

1186
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:24,708
You also deny, then, that
Mr. Cavendish gave you a check

1187
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,708
for £200
on the 21st of June last?

1188
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,208
That was a loan.

1189
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,749
Thank you, Mrs. Raikes.

1190
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:36,041
I have no further questions,
my lord.

1191
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,166
Very well, Mr. Philips.

1192
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:41,541
That seems a convenient time
to adjourn.

1193
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:42,958
The court will rise.

1194
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:12,499
Is this your first
time in London, Poirot?

1195
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:21,208
Mrs. Inglethorp must have
been very wealthy,

1196
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:24,541
with this beautiful house
and Styles Court.

1197
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:28,999
Are you gonna be doing this
all day?

1198
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,541
I steady my nerves.
That is all.

1199
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:38,083
This employment...

1200
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:44,958
...requires precision
of the fingers.

1201
01:19:46,167 --> 01:19:47,666
And with precision
of the fingers

1202
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:50,124
goes precision of the brain.

1203
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:54,083
And never have I needed that
more than now.

1204
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,541
Absolutely.

1205
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:58,208
I can build a house of cards
seven stories high

1206
01:19:58,334 --> 01:20:00,416
by placing one card
on top of another

1207
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:02,458
with a mathematical precision,
eh?

1208
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:07,791
But I cannot find the last link
in this so-mysterious case.

1209
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,708
Well, you've got a steady hand,
Poirot, I must say.

1210
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:30,958
I think I've only ever seen
your hand shake once.

1211
01:20:32,334 --> 01:20:34,791
On an occasion when
I was enraged, no doubt.

1212
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,791
It was
in Mrs. Inglethorp's room.

1213
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,166
Just after we discovered

1214
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,916
that the locks on the dispatch
case had been forced.

1215
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:43,958
Ah, yes.

1216
01:20:44,084 --> 01:20:45,333
You stood by the mantelpiece --

1217
01:20:45,459 --> 01:20:47,458
rearranging the ornaments,
as you always do --

1218
01:20:47,584 --> 01:20:49,333
and your hand shook like a leaf.

1219
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:51,124
Because I was enraged.

1220
01:20:52,292 --> 01:20:54,374
I was enraged at...

1221
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,833
-Oh, mon Dieu!
-What is it?

1222
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,208
I have an idea.
That is all. But...

1223
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:06,458
Mon Dieu!

1224
01:21:10,209 --> 01:21:11,458
garage! garage!

1225
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:16,041
For the love of heaven, madame,
direct me to the garage!

1226
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,416
Someone must drive me!

1227
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:20,499
I must hire a car immediatement!

1228
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:41,416
Can you go no faster, driver?

1229
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,749
Not unless you want us
to have an accident, sir.

1230
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,124
No, no, no.
No. No.

1231
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:51,041
Just as you please.
You know best.

1232
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:10,499
The correct position for your
hands on the steering wheel

1233
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,708
is 10 minutes to 2:00,
is it not?

1234
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,916
Mlle. Dorcas!

1235
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:08,541
Tell me, mademoiselle,

1236
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:10,624
has anyone been in the bedroom
of Mme. Inglethorp

1237
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,708
since we left the house?

1238
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:14,124
No, sir, it's locked. And we all
kept a good lookout on it.

1239
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,499
-Good.
-Mr. Poirot?

1240
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:16,874
-Yes?
-The keys.

1241
01:23:17,084 --> 01:23:18,333
Ah.

1242
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:20,791
Thank you.

1243
01:23:57,667 --> 01:23:58,916
There. You see?

1244
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,958
Already the strychnine
is beginning to precipitate

1245
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:03,416
and fall to the bottom.

1246
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:06,541
In a few hours, it'll form
colorless crystals...

1247
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,666
Which remain at the bottom
of the liquid?

1248
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:12,333
Which remain at the bottom
of the liquid.

1249
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:28,999
Inspector Japp, when, in the
course of your investigations,

1250
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:33,874
you searched the bedroom
of the accused at Styles Court,

1251
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:35,041
did you find anything?

1252
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:36,333
I did.

1253
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:38,666
Will you tell the court
what you found?

1254
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:41,916
In the chest of drawers
in Mr. Cavendish's room,

1255
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:46,541
underneath some clothing,
I found a small poison bottle.

1256
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,749
It was empty.

1257
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,541
Will you introduce Exhibit D?

1258
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:58,791
Is this the bottle?

1259
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,249
Yes, sir.

1260
01:25:01,584 --> 01:25:03,499
Did you have
the bottle examined?

1261
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:05,374
I did.

1262
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,083
It was examined by
the laboratory at Scotland Yard

1263
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:10,541
and was found to contain
traces of strychnine.

1264
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,083
Ah.

1265
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:28,708
Where is he?

1266
01:25:29,459 --> 01:25:30,749
He telephoned earlier

1267
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,124
to say he'd be back in London
this evening.

1268
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,333
He asked me to arrange
for everyone to be here.

1269
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:39,791
What did he mean?

1270
01:25:40,584 --> 01:25:41,833
I don't know.

1271
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,124
Oh, it really is too bad of him.

1272
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,083
Here he is now.

1273
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:57,208
-No.
-Oh, that's Inspector Japp.

1274
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:01,708
Evening.

1275
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:03,833
Where's Poirot?

1276
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:06,208
We don't know.
He ran off this afternoon.

1277
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:09,583
Well, I got a phone message
saying I should be here at 7:00.

1278
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:12,208
You better go up, then.

1279
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:19,958
Haven't had my tea yet,
you know.

1280
01:26:30,834 --> 01:26:32,083
Oh. Good evening.

1281
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,416
May I ask what's going on?

1282
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:36,083
You may ask, madame.

1283
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:39,166
If you get any reply,
you might let me know.

1284
01:26:59,334 --> 01:27:00,833
Here he is.

1285
01:27:09,459 --> 01:27:10,874
What on earth is he doing?

1286
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,999
He seems to be giving the driver
a driving lesson.

1287
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,874
Where on earth
have you been, Poirot?

1288
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:28,791
Good evening, Hastings.

1289
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:31,541
Good evening, Mme. Cavendish.

1290
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,041
We are assembled, yes?

1291
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:49,124
Bon.

1292
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,249
Please.

1293
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:59,083
We are all assembled, yes?

1294
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:01,124
With one exception.

1295
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:05,541
Pardon, but I must ask you all
to wait a few moments longer

1296
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,541
for the arrival
of M. Inglethorp.

1297
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,124
If that man comes
into the house, I leave it.

1298
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:11,791
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
Mlle. Howard.

1299
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,624
You must not do this.

1300
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:17,124
Remember, mademoiselle,
that this is for the sake

1301
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,916
of your dear friend,
the late Mme. Inglethorp.

1302
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,708
Why have I been summoned?

1303
01:28:35,834 --> 01:28:39,166
-What's going on?
-Wish I knew, old boy.

1304
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,916
Ah, voilà, M. Inglethorp.

1305
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,791
Asseyez-vous, monsieur.

1306
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:15,291
Mesdames et messieurs,
good evening.

1307
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:20,749
As you all know, I was invited
to investigate this case

1308
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,874
by M. John Cavendish,

1309
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:25,374
who, tonight,
in his prison cell,

1310
01:29:26,459 --> 01:29:28,208
awaits the verdict of the jury.

1311
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:32,541
I at once examined
the bedroom of the deceased,

1312
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:35,166
and I found
several things indicative.

1313
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:38,874
To take first, a fragment
of dark green material.

1314
01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:44,833
I found it caught on the bolt
of the communicating door

1315
01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:47,708
between that room
and the room of Mlle. Cynthia.

1316
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,416
Now, for a long time,

1317
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,791
I did not recognize it
for what it was, this material.

1318
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:55,374
It was a piece torn
from a green land armlet.

1319
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:02,499
At Styles, there was only one
person who worked on the land.

1320
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:05,833
Mme. Cavendish.

1321
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:11,374
Therefore, it had to be
Mme. Cavendish

1322
01:30:13,334 --> 01:30:15,249
who entered the room
by that door.

1323
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,499
But that door was bolted
on the inside.

1324
01:30:19,625 --> 01:30:21,958
When I examined the room,
Hastings, yes.

1325
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:23,958
But in the first place,

1326
01:30:24,084 --> 01:30:25,333
we only have the word
of Mme. Cavendish

1327
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:27,208
to say that the door was locked.

1328
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:29,666
And in the confusion
that followed,

1329
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:32,333
there was ample time
for her to bolt it again.

1330
01:30:32,834 --> 01:30:34,083
No, I am convinced

1331
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,166
that Mme. Cavendish
was actually in the room

1332
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:42,124
when the deceased was taken ill.

1333
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:48,499
Her reasons for entering
the bedroom of Mme. Inglethorp

1334
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:50,541
are to do with
her terrible jealousy,

1335
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:53,124
for she had learned of
the existence of a letter.

1336
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,416
But it was this letter

1337
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:56,999
that she had confronted
Mme. Inglethorp about

1338
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,624
and which she believed
would show the proof

1339
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,624
of the infidelity of her husband
with Mme. Raikes.

1340
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:06,666
At that moment, she was quite
literally mad with her jealousy.

1341
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,916
Mad enough to creep into the
bedroom of her mother-in-law

1342
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,833
in order to retrieve that paper.

1343
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:24,874
Alfred!

1344
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,958
Am I not right, madame?

1345
01:31:38,334 --> 01:31:40,166
So it was you
who destroyed the will!

1346
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,999
No, no, no, no, no, M. Lawrence.

1347
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:43,041
There was only one person

1348
01:31:43,167 --> 01:31:45,458
who could have possibly
destroyed that will.

1349
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:47,333
Mme. Inglethorp herself.

1350
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,541
But she only made it out
that very afternoon.

1351
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:54,166
Nevertheless, mon ami.

1352
01:31:56,959 --> 01:32:00,208
The temperature that day was
80 degrees in the shade, hmm?

1353
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:02,958
Oh, yes.
It was very hot.

1354
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:06,249
And yet Mme. Inglethorp
ordered a fire

1355
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:08,958
to be lighted in her room.

1356
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:10,999
Why?

1357
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,874
Because she wanted
to burn something.

1358
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,083
Précisément, Inspector Japp.

1359
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,499
Now...

1360
01:32:18,084 --> 01:32:20,749
At 4:00, Mme. Inglethorp
quarrels with her son

1361
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,166
and threatens to denounce him
to his wife.

1362
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:25,499
...large sums of money on her.

1363
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:28,208
It's not a large sum of money!
And, anyway, it's a loan.

1364
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:29,583
No!
My mind is made up!

1365
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:32,708
And you need not think
that any fear of scandal

1366
01:32:32,834 --> 01:32:34,874
between husband and wife
will deter me!

1367
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,083
It was this argument
which Dorcas overheard,

1368
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:43,249
but she mistook John Cavendish
for M. Inglethorp.

1369
01:32:45,667 --> 01:32:47,208
At 4:30, she makes a new will

1370
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:51,749
eliminating John Cavendish
from his inheritance.

1371
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,166
Now I must conjecture.

1372
01:33:01,459 --> 01:33:04,583
But I believe my conjecture
to be correct.

1373
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:08,249
She writes a letter
to her lawyer, M. Wells,

1374
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:12,374
asking him to call on her
to finalize the new will.

1375
01:33:16,042 --> 01:33:19,458
She finds she has no stamps
in her desk.

1376
01:33:20,834 --> 01:33:22,624
So she goes to the desk
of her husband

1377
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,999
to see if he has any stamps.

1378
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:32,624
It is locked, so she opens it
using her own key.

1379
01:33:34,084 --> 01:33:35,583
She discovers a paper --

1380
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:39,374
that very paper
that Mme. Cavendish

1381
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:42,208
believed to be a written proof

1382
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:44,874
of the infidelity
of her husband, John,

1383
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:49,916
but was in fact
far more serious.

1384
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,458
Is this really necessary?

1385
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,624
All we need to know is who put
the poison in my mother's coffee

1386
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:58,583
and why the poison
took so long to act!

1387
01:33:58,709 --> 01:33:59,916
Yes, that is very true,
M. Lawrence,

1388
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,458
but here we have
the little problem, you see,

1389
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:04,124
because Mme. Inglethorp,
she did not drink the coffee.

1390
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,333
What?

1391
01:34:05,459 --> 01:34:06,583
No.

1392
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:08,916
The stain on the carpet
was the coffee.

1393
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,749
She must have spilled it
before she could drink it.

1394
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:13,499
But feeling in need
of a hot drink,

1395
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:15,833
she heated up her cocoa
and drank that.

1396
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:19,208
If the strychnine
wasn't in the coffee,

1397
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,166
and we know it wasn't
in the cocoa, where was it?

1398
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:25,208
Ah.

1399
01:34:25,917 --> 01:34:28,708
Now I will pose to you all
the little question, eh?

1400
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:32,583
What third medium
was there readily to hand,

1401
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,791
a medium so suitable for the
disguising of the strychnine

1402
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:39,208
that it is
absolutely extraordinary

1403
01:34:39,334 --> 01:34:41,249
that no one has thought of it?

1404
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:44,666
Hastings?

1405
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:46,499
I've no idea.

1406
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:51,874
No?

1407
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,833
Inspector Japp?

1408
01:34:57,834 --> 01:34:59,708
Her medicine.

1409
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:03,374
Somebody put strychnine
in her tonic?

1410
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:06,833
No, there was no need, Hastings.
It was already there.

1411
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:09,374
The strychnine
that poisoned Mme. Inglethorp

1412
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,749
was the same strychnine
prescribed quite legitimately

1413
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,124
by Dr. Wilkins.

1414
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:18,208
The addition of bromide to a
solution containing strychnine

1415
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:20,499
precipitates all
the strychnine

1416
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:21,958
into colorless crystals

1417
01:35:22,084 --> 01:35:25,374
which fall to the bottom
of the mixture.

1418
01:35:27,667 --> 01:35:33,541
It is likely that the last dose
is fatal.

1419
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:40,499
Someone added her sleeping
powders to her tonic?

1420
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,624
Yes, Inspector.

1421
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:46,833
But the last link in the chain
was a paper one, eh?

1422
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:49,791
But it was not her will.

1423
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:53,999
You see,
our murderer wrote a letter.

1424
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,416
And that letter excepted,

1425
01:35:57,542 --> 01:36:00,749
there was nothing to connect
the murderer with the crime.

1426
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:03,083
But Mme. Inglethorp
found the letter,

1427
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,833
locked it in her dispatch case,
and took it to her room.

1428
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,333
It became essential that
that letter should be retrieved.

1429
01:36:17,209 --> 01:36:19,791
Without it, certain doom
faced our murderer.

1430
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,624
But I had already locked
the briefcase of Mme. Inglethorp

1431
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,291
on the morning of her death.

1432
01:36:25,417 --> 01:36:28,333
At the very moment of trying
to retrieve the letter,

1433
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:30,916
I was approaching the room
with M. John Cavendish

1434
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,541
and M. Wells, the lawyer.

1435
01:36:33,709 --> 01:36:37,708
Desperately, the murderer looks
for somewhere to conceal it.

1436
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:42,749
But there is no way in the room
of destroying the letter.

1437
01:36:43,084 --> 01:36:46,291
In a moment, the letter is torn
into three long strips...

1438
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,874
...got the keys still...

1439
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,458
...rolled into the spills,

1440
01:36:50,584 --> 01:36:53,916
and placed amongst the other
spills on the mantelpiece.

1441
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,999
The murderer then unbolts
the door

1442
01:36:57,292 --> 01:36:59,624
to the room of Mme. Cynthia
and gets away.

1443
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:03,249
My mother kept some things
in this.

1444
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:08,958
And there, mes amis,
they remained

1445
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:15,083
until they were found...
by Poirot.

1446
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,749
Oh, yes.

1447
01:37:19,084 --> 01:37:22,374
The little gray cells
have done well today.

1448
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:28,249
Un...

1449
01:37:30,959 --> 01:37:32,333
...deux...

1450
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:36,458
...trois.

1451
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:42,916
"Tonight is the night.

1452
01:37:44,334 --> 01:37:45,833
There is a good time coming

1453
01:37:45,959 --> 01:37:48,958
once the old woman is dead
and out of the way.

1454
01:37:51,084 --> 01:37:54,916
No one can possibly bring home
the crime to me.

1455
01:37:56,667 --> 01:38:01,458
That idea of yours about the
bromide was a stroke of genius.

1456
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:04,291
We must..."

1457
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:09,041
And here the writer breaks off.

1458
01:38:10,209 --> 01:38:11,541
It must warm your heart

1459
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:15,583
to know that your lover
thought so fondly of you

1460
01:38:15,709 --> 01:38:18,208
that he could not bear but to
bring himself to write to you

1461
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:20,208
at this so important moment...

1462
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:22,291
Mlle. Howard.

1463
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:28,083
Me?

1464
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:30,749
Nothing to do with me.

1465
01:38:31,292 --> 01:38:34,374
Oh, but it is everything
to do with you, mademoiselle.

1466
01:38:34,834 --> 01:38:37,374
Did I omit to read
the greeting on this letter?

1467
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,958
Forgive me.

1468
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,416
"My dearest Evelyn."

1469
01:38:50,334 --> 01:38:51,999
You fool!
You bloody fool!

1470
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,416
Be quiet, Evie.

1471
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:57,124
No, it is too late for silence,
M. Inglethorp.

1472
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:00,999
The handwriting on this letter
shouts your guilt.

1473
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:04,999
You are a heartless murderer.

1474
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:08,583
How dare you?

1475
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,041
How dare you make
such an accusation?!

1476
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:19,791
Oh, M. Inglethorp.
You do disappoint me.

1477
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:29,666
All right!

1478
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:32,708
We love each other.

1479
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,499
Take them away, Inspector Japp.

1480
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,249
Did you think we were
going to sit and wait

1481
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:46,999
for the old bitch to die?

1482
01:39:48,792 --> 01:39:50,499
We deserve the money anyway.

1483
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:52,499
And I'm not sorry.

1484
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,749
I'm not
the least little bit sorry.

1485
01:39:59,417 --> 01:40:00,666
Mr. Inglethorp?

1486
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,124
Madame?

1487
01:40:20,417 --> 01:40:23,166
How horrible.

1488
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:27,166
How horrible.

1489
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:32,041
But why did he keep the letter?

1490
01:40:32,584 --> 01:40:33,749
Ah.

1491
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:36,333
He never finished writing it,
you see, mon ami.

1492
01:40:36,459 --> 01:40:38,874
Possibly Mme. Inglethorp
returned early,

1493
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,666
interrupted him,
and, caught in the act,

1494
01:40:40,792 --> 01:40:42,874
he hastily shuts
and locks his desk.

1495
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:44,999
The rest we know.

1496
01:40:46,084 --> 01:40:48,166
Mme. Inglethorp
finds the letter,

1497
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,499
decides to say nothing about it
to her husband,

1498
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:51,999
but determines
to destroy the will

1499
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:54,416
she had just made in his favor.

1500
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:58,374
Probably the next day
she intends to make a will

1501
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,083
in favor of her son John again,
but...

1502
01:41:03,084 --> 01:41:04,624
...death intervened.

1503
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:24,458
I can't tell you how awful
it's been M. Poirot.

1504
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,541
I've had
the worst six weeks of my life.

1505
01:41:26,667 --> 01:41:28,583
I never for one moment believed
you did it.

1506
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:30,583
Inspector Japp
and the whole of Scotland Yard

1507
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:32,291
believed it, Hastings.

1508
01:41:32,917 --> 01:41:34,833
-Poor Mother.
-It's all over now.

1509
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:37,999
t's a good thing we have
M. Poirot.

1510
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:41,874
I really don't know
how to thank you, M. Poirot.

1511
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,499
-It was nothing, monsieur.
-I thought I was done for.

1512
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:47,499
You must learn
to have faith in Poirot.

1513
01:41:48,209 --> 01:41:50,749
-M. Poirot.
-Madame.

1514
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:53,124
Come on, John.

1515
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:55,874
I want to hear
everything about it.

1516
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:07,874
Do you know, Hastings,

1517
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:12,541
I owe the final discovery
of the spills entirely to you.

1518
01:42:13,042 --> 01:42:14,249
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

1519
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,291
Do you remember telling me
that my hands shook

1520
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:18,583
when I straightened the
ornaments on the mantelpiece?

1521
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:21,291
Oh, that's right.
You jumped up and rushed off.

1522
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:22,666
Exactement.

1523
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:24,791
I remembered that when
you and I were together

1524
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,333
in the room of Mme. Inglethorp

1525
01:42:26,459 --> 01:42:28,791
that I already straightened
the ornaments.

1526
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:30,416
When?

1527
01:42:32,584 --> 01:42:33,916
Now, if they were
already straightened,

1528
01:42:34,042 --> 01:42:34,958
there would be no reason

1529
01:42:35,084 --> 01:42:36,499
for me to have to
straighten them again...

1530
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:39,249
...that would have connected
the murderer with the crime.

1531
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:44,791
...unless someone in
the meantime had touched them.

1532
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,041
Good Lord.

1533
01:42:48,334 --> 01:42:50,208
You know,
one thing I don't understand

1534
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:53,583
is why Inglethorp seemed so keen
to get himself arrested.

1535
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:56,708
Because, mon ami,
it is the law of your country

1536
01:42:56,834 --> 01:42:57,999
that once acquitted,

1537
01:42:58,125 --> 01:43:00,958
a man cannot be tried
for the same offense again.

1538
01:43:01,084 --> 01:43:02,499
No, he wished to be tried.

1539
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:04,874
He would then produce
his irreproachable alibi

1540
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,958
and be safe
for the rest of his life.

1541
01:43:07,084 --> 01:43:09,291
So it was him
who bought the strychnine

1542
01:43:09,584 --> 01:43:10,749
from the chemist's shop?

1543
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,833
No, no, no, no, no, Hastings.

1544
01:43:15,209 --> 01:43:17,541
Have you not yet realized
that it was Mlle. Howard

1545
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:18,583
who went to the chemist's shop?

1546
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:19,708
Miss Howard?

1547
01:43:19,834 --> 01:43:20,999
Mais oui.

1548
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:23,124
Of course
she was heavily disguised.

1549
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:26,541
The clever devils.

1550
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:31,541
It is good to see them reunited,
is it not?

1551
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:34,666
That silly entanglement
with Mme. Raikes forgotten.

1552
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,708
The things
men and women do for love.

1553
01:43:36,834 --> 01:43:37,916
Ah, oui.

1554
01:43:38,042 --> 01:43:39,541
One thing you haven't explained

1555
01:43:39,667 --> 01:43:42,458
is the peculiar behavior
of Lawrence Cavendish.

1556
01:43:42,584 --> 01:43:44,041
I'll never forget
the way he looked

1557
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:45,749
when we went
into Mrs. Inglethorp's room.

1558
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:47,208
That is because you thought

1559
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,458
he was staring at
the mantelpiece, yes, Hastings?

1560
01:43:49,584 --> 01:43:52,041
Whereas, in effect,
he was staring at the door

1561
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:53,624
to the room of Mlle. Cynthia...

1562
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:55,624
right next to the mantelpiece.

1563
01:43:57,709 --> 01:43:59,916
He saw that that door,
it was unbolted.

1564
01:44:02,459 --> 01:44:03,916
But he swore it was bolted.

1565
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:06,999
Exactement.
He was shielding her.

1566
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,666
When M. Lawrence saw

1567
01:44:09,792 --> 01:44:12,333
that the door to the room of
Mlle. Cynthia, it was unbolted,

1568
01:44:12,459 --> 01:44:13,708
he jumped to the conclusion

1569
01:44:13,834 --> 01:44:15,833
that she knew something
about the murder.

1570
01:44:15,959 --> 01:44:18,291
But why? Why would
he want to protect her?

1571
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:20,333
Because he's in love with her,
of course.

1572
01:44:20,459 --> 01:44:22,958
Well, now, that's just
where I know you're wrong.

1573
01:44:23,084 --> 01:44:26,416
I happen to know for a fact
that he positively dislikes her.

1574
01:44:27,084 --> 01:44:27,999
Indeed?

1575
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:30,124
Then let me enlighten you,
mon ami.

1576
01:44:30,584 --> 01:44:33,041
He succeeded in crushing
the coffee cup beneath his feet

1577
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:36,166
because, Hastings, he remembered
that it was in fact

1578
01:44:36,334 --> 01:44:39,041
Mlle. Cynthia who took up
the coffee for Mme. Inglethorp

1579
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:40,333
on the previous night.

1580
01:44:40,459 --> 01:44:44,124
Now, from that moment, he quite
uselessly and quite strenuously

1581
01:44:44,459 --> 01:44:47,958
upheld a theory of death
by natural causes.

1582
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,083
Well, I know you're wrong
about this, Poirot --

1583
01:44:53,209 --> 01:44:56,458
Mr. Poirot!
Lieutenant Hastings!

1584
01:45:01,792 --> 01:45:03,041
Oh!

1585
01:45:03,959 --> 01:45:05,624
Oh, you're both such dear men.

1586
01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:08,458
Well, we want to
tell you something.

1587
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:09,333
We?

1588
01:45:09,459 --> 01:45:11,666
You are both
to be offered congratulations.

1589
01:45:11,792 --> 01:45:14,041
-Is that not so?
-Congratulations?

1590
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:16,541
Well, Cynthia and I
are to be married.

1591
01:45:16,667 --> 01:45:18,083
Where are Mary and John?

1592
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:20,249
Oh, uh, they're, um...

1593
01:45:20,875 --> 01:45:22,249
Come on.

1594
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:31,916
Hastings.

1595
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:40,291
What a wonderful girl.

1596
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,166
I shall never understand women.

1597
01:45:42,292 --> 01:45:44,208
Ah.
Console yourself, mon ami.

1598
01:45:44,584 --> 01:45:47,458
Perhaps one day, when this
terrible war has ended,

1599
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:50,124
we shall
work again together, huh?

1600
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:52,416
And Poirot
will explain all to you.
