1
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,249
Damn pests.

2
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,666
Aah!

3
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:00,291
Jack?

4
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,041
I'm here, darling,
I'm here.

5
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,791
It's all right, Susan.

6
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,666
I just stumbled, that's all.

7
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,583
You shouldn't be out here.

8
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,708
You know what Dr. Bernard said.

9
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,499
So soon after the operation.

10
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,624
Yes, I know what
Dr. Bernard said --

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,916
stay inside,
get plenty of sleep.

12
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,374
Well, that may be good advice
for a tortoise, Susan...

13
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:54,833
but not for --

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,666
Oh, damn this infernal ulcer.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,791
Darling, you're still weak.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,291
It'll mend itself.

17
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,708
It just takes time.

18
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,249
You've just got to
learn to be patient.

19
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,749
What is it?

20
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,749
Susan?

21
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,333
It's up there again.

22
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,333
That face!

23
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,416
You heard it
that time, Jack.

24
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,416
Don't tell me
you didn't hear it.

25
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,416
That mad, horrible cackling.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,249
She was up there --

27
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,999
up there like before!

28
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,291
Laughing!

29
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,124
Well, this is it.
What was his name again?

30
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,624
Naughton --
Samuel James Naughton.

31
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,791
Welcome to my hotel.

32
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,916
This is the greatest day
of my life.

33
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,208
Let me take your bags.

34
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,499
Thank you, M. Naughton.

35
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,499
We received your letter
this morning,

36
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,499
and as you see,
we came straight here.

37
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,749
I've got two of my best rooms

38
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,416
all ready and waiting
for you, gentlemen.

39
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,624
Thank you, M. Naughton.

40
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,958
Now, in your letter
you stated that

41
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,374
three farm workers
have been poisoned,

42
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,958
the syringe of the doctor
has gone missing,

43
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,374
and that it is only I,
Hercule Poirot,

44
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,124
who can solve the mystery.

45
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,999
That's right, sir --
but there's plenty of time.

46
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,708
How about
a nice pot of tea first?

47
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,958
Oh, that's very kind.

48
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:09,291
You don't do sandwiches at all,
do you?

49
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,416
M. Naughton,
in a matter of murder,

50
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,374
there is never
the time to lose.

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,624
The facts of this case,
if you please?

52
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,833
Right you are, sir --
it's all here.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,791
The first 200 pages anyway.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,708
"The Needle in the Haystack,

55
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,666
A new murder mystery
by Clarissa Naughton."

56
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,291
I use a woman's name.

57
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,291
Seems to help them sell better.

58
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,666
It's a corker of a plot,

59
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,666
only I've got myself into a bit
of a stew with the ending.

60
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,541
So I thought,
I'll drop him a line.

61
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,999
Perhaps he'll come
and sort it out for me.

62
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,541
So I said to my wife,
you can but ask.

63
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,958
And blow me down,
here you are.

64
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:55,124
I did mention it was a book
in the letter.

65
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,333
Oh, Hastings.

66
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,041
Mon Dieu!

67
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,166
125 miles, Hastings, we come on
a wild gooseberry hunt.

68
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,916
And now we have missed
our last train

69
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,916
and we cannot leave until
the morning.

70
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,291
Just... sacre!

71
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,958
Cheer up, Poirot.

72
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,666
Plenty of things to do
to while away the --

73
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,333
I say!
That looks like fun.

74
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,583
Come on, Poirot.

75
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,999
Genuine death masks
of local murderers.

76
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,041
I say, this is interesting.

77
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,124
Apparently, they got them by
taking actual wax impressions

78
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,833
of the killers' faces
after their execution.

79
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,874
Pretty grisly stuff, eh?

80
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,208
Well, I find it most curious,
Hastings --

81
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,499
this English passion for
perusing a collection of

82
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,916
the glorified scarecrows.

83
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,624
So far, I have not seen one
likeness that is truly accurate.

84
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,374
Hastings.

85
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,458
I'm sorry, sir,

86
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,458
we're just closing,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

87
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,083
Are you coming, Hastings?

88
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,208
Locking up time, I'm afraid.

89
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:13,833
-Yes, but --
-This way, please, sir.

90
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,291
Sir?

91
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,749
Never quite as realistic
in the flesh,

92
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,541
somehow, are they?

93
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,041
Any pain there?

94
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,624
No.

95
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,249
Well, I don't think there's
any serious damage,

96
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,291
but for goodness sake,
be more careful, Jonathan!

97
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,374
You know, these things
can perforate.

98
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,583
And it's not just
a question of diet.

99
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,083
Any stress or exertion
is strictly taboo.

100
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,249
Instances of post-operative
erosion can --

101
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:56,624
All right, thank you, Geoffrey,
here endeth the lesson.

102
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,083
Now, why don't you join us
for dinner?

103
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,749
Ah!

104
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:05,083
Will you be wanting a table
in the restaurant at all?

105
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,416
We do stop serving at 9:00.

106
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,791
Thanks.

107
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:10,291
I'm actually here to see
some friends.

108
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,999
I'll be dining with them
tonight, up at Marsdon Manor.

109
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,499
Oh, yes,
I know it, sir.

110
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,666
Well, have a good evening.

111
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,958
Ah, Mr. Poirot!

112
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,458
You worked it all out now,
my whodunit?

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,083
No, M. Naughton,

114
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,624
I did not give another thought
to your whodunit.

115
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,249
The brain of Hercule Poirot

116
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,833
is like a finely tuned engine
of a motorcar.

117
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,624
It does not run on
the cheap, low-grade fuel.

118
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,708
Not to worry.

119
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,874
Give you something to read
in bed.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,749
I'll just get your keys for you.

121
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,749
Oh, someone just back
from Africa?

122
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,833
Kenya, actually.

123
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,708
Just a small present
for someone.

124
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,458
If you'll excuse me.

125
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,499
Monsieur.

126
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,833
Ah, thank you.

127
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,499
I picked it up
in one of the markets.

128
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,249
It was rather well done.

129
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,374
Something another artist
would appreciate.

130
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,083
And it's actually supposed to be
some sort of talisman.

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,208
You know, evil spirits of
the departed,

132
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,041
all that hokum.

133
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,624
I'm sorry,
have I said something?

134
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,749
Oh, Andrew --
I don't think you've met

135
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
Geoffrey Bernard,
my medic.

136
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,124
And this is Captain Black,

137
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,208
an old family friend,
just over from East Africa.

138
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,583
Oh, really?
Where were you stationed?

139
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,416
In Kenya,
near Lake Victoria.

140
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,624
Shall we go in, darling?

141
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,999
Doctor?

142
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,249
Oh, I have a cousin in Nairobi.

143
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,041
Ah, we are just about to have
dinner, Miss Rawlinson.

144
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,416
Won't you join us?

145
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,416
Thank you, Mr. Maltravers.

146
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,458
The books are still in
a bit of a mess, I'm afraid.

147
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,666
Well, perhaps you could
join us later.

148
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,291
It's as though
she's mocking me.

149
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:51,458
And then, just as suddenly,
it stops.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,999
As if I completely
imagined it all.

151
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,666
So, let me get this clear.

152
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,499
What you're saying is,
out there in the garden,

153
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,541
there's the ghost
of a dead girl,

154
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,041
up in a tree.

155
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,124
Well, the story is that

156
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,624
50 or so years ago,
a young, teenaged girl

157
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,416
killed herself
here in these grounds.

158
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,458
She'd been jilted by a lover
or some such thing.

159
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,916
Anyway, she climbed to the top
of that massive cedar out there,

160
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,833
and threw herself off.

161
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,583
And over the years,

162
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,374
people in the village...

163
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:39,874
Well, you know how these
superstitions take root.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,791
In my experience of these cases,

165
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,333
a lot of it is
auto-suggestive.

166
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,541
People believe

167
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,958
that they've witnessed some sort
of paranormal --

168
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,249
Dr. Bernard, I know what I saw.

169
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,833
Uh, I'm just off to
the bank now, then.

170
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,374
I'll see you later.

171
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,041
Danvers.

172
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,916
Chilly morning.

173
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,916
Morning, sir.

174
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,999
Finally, throughout
the United Kingdom,

175
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,166
preparations are
nearing completion

176
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,499
for the national
civil defense exercise

177
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,583
called by His Majesty's
government for this Wednesday.

178
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,208
The prime minister...

179
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,458
Ah, Poirot.
Sleep well?

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,374
Like a top, Hastings.

181
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,208
I am turning and spinning
all of the night.

182
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,499
And then,
at 3:00 in the morning,

183
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,958
hé là, the ultimate
desperation.

184
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,374
Ah, M. Naughton.

185
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,208
This really is incroyable.

186
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,958
There is such a tangle of
the confused threads,

187
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,374
I admit surrender.

188
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,166
Everyone has the alibi
that is unbreakable.

189
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,041
Who could possibly have
committed the murders?

190
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,958
I know,
that's what stumped me.

191
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,291
I seem to have backed myself
into a corner this time,

192
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,249
and I can't get out.

193
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,833
Not to worry.

194
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:57,958
Was the accommodation all right?

195
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,333
No, M. Naughton.

196
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,208
The accommodation
was all wrong.

197
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,499
Oh.

198
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,541
The duck-feather pillows --

199
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,541
it feels as if the ducks
are still in them.

200
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:14,041
Looks as if Captain Black didn't
enjoy his stay much either.

201
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,124
Comment?

202
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,333
Booked in for a full week
last night,

203
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,083
paid up in advance.

204
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,083
And now this morning,
he's gone.

205
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,874
Perhaps he was frightened away

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,124
by ghosts.

207
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,749
Now, then, breakfast.

208
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,958
How about a nice kipper?
They're fresh today.

209
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:32,291
My tisane, two slices of bread,
toasted on one side only,

210
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:35,541
if you please.

211
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,374
Ghosts, did you say?

212
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,249
Well, yes, haunted house,
Marsdon Manor,

213
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,791
where he went last night.

214
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,374
They say it's full of them.

215
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,958
You have seen them yourself?

216
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,749
Well, no, not personally
I haven't, of course.

217
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,874
How do you know
they are fresh?

218
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,499
Sorry?

219
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:51,958
The kippers.

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,249
Oh, yes, sir.

221
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh, they're fresh, all right.

222
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,666
We get them delivered
twice a week from Grimsby.

223
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,916
So, it is the place of
the untold evil.

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,124
Crawling with the spirits of
the living dead.

225
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,499
Grimsby?

226
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,666
Marsdon Manor.

227
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:14,208
M. Naughton,
my breakfast if you please.

228
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,083
We both have
the urgent train to catch.

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,749
Is Mr. Maltravers
still outside?

230
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,374
I need to have a word with him.

231
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,749
I suppose he must be.

232
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,416
Is it 11:00 already?

233
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,499
He's usually come in
for his pills by now.

234
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,666
Madame!
It's Mr. Maltravers.

235
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,666
I think you'd better
come, quick.

236
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,374
Come on, move along!

237
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:16,791
What is it now?

238
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,124
It's an emergency!

239
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,499
Shift yourself.

240
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,374
Allez, allez.

241
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,291
Don't you come that, matey.

242
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,124
You just move back.

243
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:27,666
Hold on.

244
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,541
Isn't that Hercule Poirot?
Right on our doorstep.

245
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,291
Nothing's been touched, sir.

246
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,958
That's just how I found him.

247
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,333
Thank you.

248
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,958
The doctor warned us all
it could happen.

249
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,124
That wretched ulcer
could rupture,

250
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,458
cause internal bleeding.

251
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,458
He must have
choked on the blood.

252
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,458
If only he'd listened,
taken a little advice.

253
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:59,624
Fate can be so cruel at times.

254
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,208
M. Danvers...

255
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,541
you say that you discovered
the body at 11:00.

256
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,499
Now, before this,

257
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:19,083
when was the last time
that you saw him alive,

258
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,458
your employer?

259
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,249
About half past 9:00.

260
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,333
He just plonked himself on
the old stone seat by the hedge.

261
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,999
He often went there for
a little snooze after breakfast.

262
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,541
The stone seat.

263
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,166
His poor, young wife.

264
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
So heartbreaking.

265
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,166
They hadn't even been
married two years.

266
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,083
Met at one of them society
parties up in London.

267
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,916
Real whirlwind romance.

268
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,458
If ever two people were in love.

269
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,083
And the other lady?

270
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,166
Miss Rawlinson?

271
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,333
Oh, she goes back a lot longer.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,083
She'd been his secretary, oh,
must have been 20 years.

273
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,166
Well, "secretary" --

274
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,624
she practically
ran his affairs for him.

275
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,791
He wasn't the most organized
of gentlemen.

276
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,624
Terrible sight, though.

277
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,208
There's something about
that look in his eyes.

278
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,999
Almost as if he'd seen a ghost.

279
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:26,249
Yes.

280
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,958
Come along, my dear,
take one of these.

281
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:54,499
Eh bien, regardons, regardons.

282
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,541
Ah, voilà.

283
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:02,999
What've you found?

284
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,041
What I was looking for.

285
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,666
I don't see anything --

286
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,041
Oh, look at that.

287
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,416
Un moment, un moment.
Qu'est-ce que c'est?

288
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,499
Ah, there are more.

289
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,333
Looking puzzled, Poirot?

290
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
Can't see your problem.

291
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,083
Poor chap had
a stomach condition.

292
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,624
You heard what the ambulance man
said, internal hemorrhage.

293
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,416
Plain as day,
caused him to choke to death.

294
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,874
Mais certainement, Hastings,

295
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,833
that is the conclusion
most obvious.

296
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,624
But perhaps it is too obvious.

297
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,374
You noticed, of course,
the faint ridges in the grass.

298
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,916
Ridges?

299
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,833
And you cannot have
failed to notice

300
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,708
the mud across
the back of his shoes.

301
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,916
You put those two facts
together, Hastings,

302
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,666
and you'll reach the conclusion
that is most disturbing.

303
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,041
The body of the dead man

304
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,624
was dragged physically
from the stone seat

305
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,749
to the foot of the tree.

306
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,374
Good lord.

307
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,291
I think it is time
that we telephone

308
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,624
the Chief Inspector Japp
at Scotland Yard.

309
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,083
We were in
the south of France,

310
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,874
two months ago.

311
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,249
That's when it got really bad.

312
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,583
We had to cut short our holiday,

313
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,916
rush back
so they could operate.

314
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,999
They said, so long as he rested,
took things easy,

315
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,916
there was every chance he'd make
a full recovery.

316
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:48,374
But you couldn't keep Jack
indoors like that, all day long.

317
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:55,083
He'd suffocate, go mad.

318
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,041
My dear, do you think it's w--

319
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,416
It was her!
I know it.

320
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,874
She killed him.

321
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,624
"She," Mme. Maltravers?

322
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,541
I think it would be best
if you all left now.

323
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,791
She's still in
a state of shock.

324
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,208
Up there, in the tree.

325
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,541
That awful, laughing woman.

326
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,583
That's what he saw.

327
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,374
That's what...

328
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,499
frightened him to death.

329
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,083
Life insurance policy, Poirot.

330
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:49,041
£50,000!

331
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,458
That is indeed a great amount
of money, Chief Inspector.

332
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:54,291
Ask yourself, Poirot...

333
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,999
man insures his life
for a hefty sum like this.

334
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,166
His health takes
a sudden turn for the worse.

335
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:04,708
He becomes a burden
on his poor young wife.

336
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,541
He might decide
life's not worth living anymore.

337
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,499
He's more use to her dead
than alive.

338
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,708
Suicide?

339
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,416
Hmm!
Insurance fraud!

340
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,708
It's certainly
worth considering.

341
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,916
Well, the boys
from the insurance company

342
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,791
have been doing
their homework,

343
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,708
and it seems that
our Mr. Maltravers'

344
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,749
business affairs
have been going through

345
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,624
rather a sticky patch
of late.

346
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,249
As things stood when he died, he
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

347
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,166
No, no, no, no,
no, merci.

348
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,333
Now, that would give him
a pretty powerful motive

349
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,749
to engineer his own death,
pay off his debts,

350
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,291
and make sure Mrs. Maltravers

351
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,083
was left well provided for.

352
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,249
Tell me,
Chief Inspector Japp,

353
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,374
how is M. Maltravers
supposed to have taken his life,

354
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:56,208
when there are no signs of
the violence,

355
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,541
no injuries of any kind
on the outside,

356
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,916
and there is no poison

357
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,624
that can fill the mouth of a man
with the blood?

358
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,999
Well, presumably,
the postmortem will tell us

359
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,374
if it was the ulcer.

360
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:07,916
Yes, that'll take
a couple of days yet.

361
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,916
We've got to get a pathologist
over from Norwich.

362
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,708
Of course, we mustn't forget
Captain Black.

363
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:12,999
Now, he left
in a bit of a hurry.

364
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,916
I hope you've got your lads
on the lookout for him,

365
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,291
Chief Inspector.

366
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,166
Yes, we circulated
a full description

367
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,416
to all the major seaports.

368
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,999
Although, of course,
it's not really the --

369
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,833
You seem to know
a lot about all this, sir.

370
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,791
Crime and detection,
Chief Inspector,

371
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,166
are a special hobby of mine,

372
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,166
as Mr. Poirot here
will tell you.

373
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,249
Now, I've drawn up a little list
of the principal suspects

374
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,708
which I think you'll find
very useful.

375
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,083
Thank you.

376
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,833
M. Naughton,
perhaps you would oblige us

377
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,458
with a little more of your
most illustrious applesauce.

378
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,666
Certainly!

379
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,916
Thank you.

380
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,124
So, what do you reckon, then?

381
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,458
If it wasn't suicide,
and it wasn't natural causes?

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,041
Surely, you don't believe
all this hogwash

383
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,708
about ghosts
and haunted trees.

384
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,291
I believe, mon ami, that there
is at work here some great evil.

385
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:13,291
In what shape or form,
we shall soon discover.

386
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,458
Sometimes, they walk
in their sleep, no?

387
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,416
And like the misdeeds
of the past,

388
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,041
they return to haunt us.

389
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,708
You think I'm mad...
out of my mind.

390
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,374
What I said before --

391
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,083
No, no, no, Mme. Maltravers.

392
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,208
Like you,
I also believe that there was,

393
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,874
in the garden, something...

394
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,416
that struck the terror into
the heart of your poor husband.

395
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,666
It wasn't only the garden,
Mr. Poirot.

396
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,416
There was something else.

397
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:36,624
A couple of weeks ago,

398
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:41,124
we were just getting ready
to go to bed.

399
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,166
Jack was in the bathroom.

400
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:53,249
I'd just taken
my sleeping pill.

401
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,541
I turned to the mirror
to brush my hair, and...

402
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,249
It was her blood!

403
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,499
I know it was her blood.

404
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,916
Tell me, madame...

405
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,833
when your husband went
for his walk in the garden,

406
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,291
you observed him
from the window?

407
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,666
I saw him go out.

408
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,666
Then he disappeared from my view

409
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,541
round the other side
of the house.

410
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,416
I was working on a watercolor
at the south lawns.

411
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,874
And he used to go and sit in
front of the old yew hedge.

412
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,874
On the west side of the house?

413
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,249
Mm.

414
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,874
And the secretary to your
husband, Mlle. Rawlinson?

415
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,083
Uh, she went to the bank,
at about 9:30,

416
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,791
and returned at 11:00.

417
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,416
I'd just finished my painting.

418
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,791
I think I was just
washing the brushes through

419
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:53,083
when she came back in
and asked to see Jack.

420
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:56,083
That's when Danvers
came running across the lawn.

421
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,916
I'm sorry, Mr. Poirot.

422
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:01,208
-I'm sorry.
-Madame?

423
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,374
National civil defense day.

424
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,083
Is it an emergency?

425
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,124
The doctor does have rather
a lot of house calls

426
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,583
later this morning.

427
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,458
S'il vous plaît, madame,

428
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,374
say to him
it is Hercule Poirot.

429
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,541
I think that he will see me.

430
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,749
Doctor?

431
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,833
There's a gentleman outside

432
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,291
suffering from
"erkul poirot."

433
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,916
He seems to think
it's quite serious.

434
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,583
Oh!
Yes, thank you, Margaret.

435
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,374
Show him through.

436
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,999
Thank you.

437
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,541
-Mr. Poirot.
-Monsieur le docteur.

438
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,499
I would like to introduce you,
if I may, to my associate,

439
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,041
Captain Hastings.

440
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,583
How do you do?

441
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,749
For the children.
Help yourself.

442
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,208
Oh! Thank you.

443
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,791
Dr. Bernard,
in your expert opinion,

444
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,249
how dangerous was it,

445
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,333
the stomach condition
of M. Maltravers?

446
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,166
I'm afraid I'm not in
the fortune-telling business,

447
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:49,541
Mr. Poirot.

448
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,541
Of course, we all knew there was
a risk of complications.

449
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,916
There always is.

450
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,416
But he was a very
hardy type, Jonathan.

451
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,374
Very strong constitution.

452
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,999
Shouldn't have had any problems.
He really shouldn't.

453
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,374
Ah, what do I know?

454
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,416
45 years' medical experience,

455
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,833
sometimes doesn't amount
to a jot in the end.

456
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,624
You'll rot your teeth, you know.

457
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,249
Do you also prescribe the drugs
for Mme. Maltravers?

458
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,833
Oh, yes, from time to time.

459
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,083
Sleeping pills,
that sort of thing.

460
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:26,958
She frequently --

461
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,874
That's odd.

462
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:31,833
Something is wrong,
Dr. Bernard?

463
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,208
Chloroform.

464
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,958
Five fluid ounce bottle.

465
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,333
It's gone.

466
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,208
Hello, Mast--

467
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:48,666
Oh, Mr. Poirot.

468
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,833
No, I'm afraid she isn't.

469
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:52,833
She went into town,

470
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,249
to the civil defense meeting
at the parish hall.

471
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,624
About an hour ago.

472
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,666
The civil defense meeting.

473
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,291
Come, Hastings.

474
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:06,041
The time may be of
the essence!

475
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:11,499
Excuse me, madame,
excuse me,

476
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,499
could you tell me please,
where is the parish hall?

477
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,416
Merci.

478
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,541
Vite, mon ami!

479
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,166
Hastings.

480
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,999
Noxious gases.

481
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:56,083
In the event of
a sudden emergency,

482
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,208
make sure the mask is secured
by fastening the strap

483
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:02,958
of the back --

484
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,374
Ahem.

485
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,874
Um...

486
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,999
Excuse me, madame.

487
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:12,666
Mme. Maltravers, are you here?

488
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,833
Mme. Maltravers!

489
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,791
The gas mask, quick,

490
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:22,041
remove it at once!

491
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,541
Excuse me, excuse me.
Clear the way, please!

492
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,749
Clear the way, please.

493
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:29,249
Excuse me,
excuse me, please.

494
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,749
Excuse me, excuse me.

495
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,999
Some smelling salts
or some brandy.

496
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,416
And fetch at once the doctor.

497
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,999
Captain Black!

498
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,458
Quick, Hastings!

499
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,999
He must not leave!

500
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,708
In a bit of a rush,
aren't we, sir?

501
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,583
It's all right, madame.
It is all right.

502
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,916
Sir?

503
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,374
Hastings, I think
it would be wise

504
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,749
for you to travel back
with Mme. Maltravers

505
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,083
until she is quite recovered
from this ordeal.

506
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:53,458
Oh, yes, of course.

507
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,333
-Madame.
-Thank you.

508
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,999
See you back at the hotel.

509
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,749
Oui.

510
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,874
Why did you try and run away
back there, Captain Black?

511
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,416
I wasn't running away.

512
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,791
I was running downstairs
to see if I could help.

513
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,499
I didn't fill this
blasted thing with poison.

514
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,208
My God,

515
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:30,749
I wouldn't harm so much as
a hair of her head.

516
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,458
I've done nothing wrong.

517
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,083
Well, in that case, perhaps
you'd like to tell us

518
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,458
why you vanished like a ghost

519
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:42,333
on the morning
Mr. Maltravers' death,

520
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,624
where you've been
for the last 24 hours,

521
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,166
and how you came to turn up
again here today

522
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:50,666
as an attempt was being made on
his poor young widow's life?

523
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:56,083
Captain Black.

524
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,041
If you will not answer
the questions

525
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,374
of the Chief Inspector Japp,

526
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,249
perhaps you will answer
one of mine.

527
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:07,374
How long have you been in love
with Mme. Maltravers?

528
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,749
This is preposterous!

529
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,124
Now, come, come, come,
come, monsieur.

530
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:13,833
The truth, if you please.

531
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,166
How could I stay here?

532
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,791
How could I stay when every
second was agony for me?

533
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,624
Seeing the two of them
like that.

534
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,916
I thought I'd managed
to get over it.

535
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,999
But when I saw her again,
I knew it was no good.

536
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,874
I was just so ashamed of
my feelings.

537
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,041
I caught the train back to
Tilbury next morning,

538
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,083
planning to return to
East Africa

539
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,541
and put it all behind me.

540
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,458
Then when I read of his death

541
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,416
in the newspaper, naturally,
I had to come back.

542
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:59,124
Yes, of course...
the newspaper!

543
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,208
Tell me, Captain Black.

544
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,999
The night you arrived
in the hotel,

545
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,541
you had with you a parcel,

546
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,041
is that not so,
wrapped in the newspaper?

547
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,916
Yes, it was an African carving,

548
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:15,083
a kind of talisman that I picked
up while traveling in Kenya.

549
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,624
Yes, and you said,

550
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,291
as I now recall, it was
a present for someone?

551
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:21,874
For Susan,
and that's right.

552
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:25,041
I'm afraid it might have
unnerved her rather.

553
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,624
She's slightly superstitious
about that kind of thing.

554
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,416
Is this relevant, Poirot?

555
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,916
Relevant, Chief Inspector?

556
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,916
Yes, for we have now
found the key

557
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:39,874
to the death of
M. Jonathan Maltravers.

558
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,999
The colors really are
delightful, I must say.

559
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:49,083
You really have a special
talent, Mrs. Maltravers.

560
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,249
Thank you.

561
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:55,666
Look, are you sure
you're all right now?

562
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:57,416
It's been such a ghastly ordeal.

563
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,666
Some rest and quiet, I think,
is what she needs the most.

564
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,958
She's in safe hands,
aren't you, my dear?

565
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:14,041
Captain Hastings!

566
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,791
I'd like you to have this,
for all your help today.

567
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,291
I say, that's awfully kind
of you. Are you sure?

568
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,416
I can't stand
another night of it --

569
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,874
on my own in the house
with her.

570
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,333
Miss Rawlinson?
I don't understand.

571
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,374
There was
something between them,

572
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,749
once upon a time.

573
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,958
Years before I met him.

574
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:39,124
Of course it was all over
as far as Jack was concerned,

575
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,499
but I don't know.

576
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,499
With all this,
I just don't know anymore.

577
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,083
All of a sudden,
she scares me.

578
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,916
I see.

579
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,666
Come back and have dinner
with us tonight, please?

580
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,666
You and Mr. Poirot.

581
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,166
I'd just feel safer.

582
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,833
So, what's happened?

583
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,874
Have they arrested
Captain Black?

584
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,208
The fog, it begins
to clear, Hastings.

585
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:22,083
But there are yet many questions
that remain unanswered.

586
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,833
So, I come here
for the early lunch.

587
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,874
The Salade Niçoise will prove
most nourishing

588
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,541
for the little gray cells.

589
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,124
So, what have you found out?
Was Maltravers murdered or not?

590
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:37,249
Oh, yes, Hastings,
he was murdered

591
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,374
most cruelly
and in the cold blood.

592
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,208
What about Mrs. Maltravers?

593
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,708
I wonder who put the chloroform
in her gas mask.

594
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:49,041
Ah, yes, the mask.

595
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,916
How is Mme. Maltravers now?

596
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:55,708
She is quite recovered
from her ordeal?

597
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,416
Yes, sort of.

598
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,083
Actually, she's asked us both
out there to dinner tonight.

599
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:02,458
To the manor.

600
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:06,166
She still seems to be worried
about that secretary, Miss --

601
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,708
Hastings,
is this not the picture

602
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:12,041
painted by Mme. Maltravers
on the morning of the tragedy?

603
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,416
Yes.

604
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,249
My worst suspicions
are now confirmed.

605
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,833
Regarde, Hastings --
it is all here.

606
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,458
This picture
tells the whole story.

607
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:19,708
You do not see?

608
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,083
Sorry, Poirot.

609
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,874
Just looks like a painting of
the garden to me.

610
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,458
The eggs.

611
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,041
Yes, the broken eggs.

612
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,083
It must have been there.

613
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,166
Ah, why did
I not see before?

614
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,249
Mr. Poirot?
Inspector Japp on the phone,

615
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,208
from the local
police headquarters.

616
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,833
Sounds as if
the plot's thickening.

617
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,999
Ah, Poirot.

618
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:49,499
Thought you might be
interested to hear

619
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,249
the rather startling results
of that postmortem.

620
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,666
According to this,
what actually killed

621
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,624
Jonathan Maltravers was --

622
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,624
Now, how the devil
did you know that?

623
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,249
We have not a moment
to waste, Chief Inspector.

624
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,916
Tell me, do you still have
stationed at the manor house

625
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,166
the constable
outside in the garden?

626
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,791
Bon.
Then listen to me carefully.

627
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,458
You must give to him
the following instructions.

628
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,291
Incidentally, M. Naughton,

629
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,958
the killer is the explorer
who is bed-ridden.

630
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,208
-Really?
-Mais oui.

631
00:40:31,334 --> 00:40:33,624
He fires into the fruitcake
a poison dart

632
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,249
from his window upstairs.

633
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,041
Good lord, I think you may have
solved it for me!

634
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,583
And you, my friend, can repay
with a small service for me.

635
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,833
Susan, I...

636
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:05,583
I'm so sorry about...

637
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,041
I had to come back.

638
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,083
Do you understand?

639
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,124
It was very sweet of you,
Captain.

640
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,541
Seems to be blowing up
a bit of a gale out there.

641
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,249
Maybe, Hastings,
the strong gales,

642
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,916
they are to be expected
at this time of year.

643
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,291
Strong enough
to waken the dead.

644
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,291
No, no, no, madame,
seat yourself, please.

645
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,791
Please be seated.

646
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,374
It is nothing.

647
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,958
Voilà.

648
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,999
Oh, my God.

649
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:29,958
My God, what's happening?

650
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:35,416
It is the wind, madame.

651
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:38,958
Nothing more.

652
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,083
No.

653
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,083
No, those doors were locked.

654
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,208
I locked them both
before dinner.

655
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,708
I distinctly remem--

656
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,791
Be still, Mme. Maltravers.

657
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,083
Jack?

658
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:09,458
Oh, my God.

659
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,749
No.

660
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:14,833
No, it can't be.

661
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,916
Madame, your hand,

662
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,416
it is bleeding.

663
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,041
No!

664
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:27,958
No, Mr. Poirot...

665
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:31,833
Jack's blood.

666
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:34,916
My husband's blood

667
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:39,083
is on my hands.

668
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:43,833
Because...

669
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:50,708
I killed him.

670
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,916
Lights, Hastings.

671
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:04,249
Lights, Chief Inspector.

672
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,749
You have heard enough,
Chief Inspector Japp?

673
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:12,499
I am afraid it's all over,
Mrs. Maltravers.

674
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:16,624
Entre.

675
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,291
You performed your part
most splendidly...

676
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,291
M. Naughton.

677
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,291
I will be able to tell
my grandchildren

678
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,083
I helped Mr. Hercule Poirot

679
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:36,041
solve one of his
most baffling cases.

680
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,541
Merci, monsieur.

681
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:39,874
Right, come on, Baines,

682
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,624
let's get her out of here.

683
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,333
Susan.

684
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:51,833
You did this for me?

685
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,124
For you?

686
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,374
But I don't understand!

687
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:15,833
This mask?

688
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:17,749
A wax cast, mademoiselle,

689
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,624
taken from the face of
the deceased.

690
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,541
A device most macabre, huh?

691
00:45:27,209 --> 00:45:29,374
But I fear it was necessary
for the success

692
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,249
of this little masquerade.

693
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,874
But, the blood?

694
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,874
A little red paint

695
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,708
that I pressed into her hand
a few seconds before.

696
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,916
In fact, it was
the same red paint

697
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,416
that she herself used

698
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:48,124
to produce the blood on
the mirror in her bedroom.

699
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:57,708
She put --

700
00:45:58,209 --> 00:45:59,458
Oh, yes.

701
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:02,374
Just as she invented
the face in the cedar tree.

702
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,958
Of course,
there was no face.

703
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,666
There was no laughter.

704
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,833
The wind paints the pictures
in her leaves,

705
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,791
and the screechings of the rook
plays the tricks upon the ears.

706
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,916
The seeds of fear,
once they are sown,

707
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,624
begin to grow
in the imagination.

708
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,833
But why?

709
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,791
Simplement...

710
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,708
to unsettle her husband,

711
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:43,583
to drive him to his grave.

712
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,374
Remember, mademoiselle,
that his condition,

713
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,916
it is still weak
after the operation, yes?

714
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,958
She knows that any sudden upset

715
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,874
or shock could be most
disastrous to his health.

716
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:00,583
Alors, voilà.

717
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,458
The insurance, it is paid out

718
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,458
and she has got rid of
the husband

719
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,916
she had married
only for his money.

720
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,833
Unfortunately, Mr. Maltravers
turned out to be rather stronger

721
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,374
than she had bargained for,

722
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,041
which was why she decided on

723
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,583
more drastic measures.

724
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,249
Ah, yes.

725
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:22,791
The little rook rifle.

726
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,416
Jack?

727
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:31,124
Mlle. Rawlinson,
you are at the bank,

728
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,749
M. Danvers at work
in another part of the garden

729
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,333
and so she took her chance.

730
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:39,458
The rook rifle,

731
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:44,124
with its tiny bullets,
was the murder weapon.

732
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:47,791
Parfait.

733
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:04,291
The bullet,
it is embedded in the brain,

734
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,124
and the effect,
it is complete.

735
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,916
The internal hemorrhage,
that is fatal.

736
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,333
For the moment, she conceals
the weapon in the hedge,

737
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:18,083
and in so doing,
she disturbs

738
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:19,958
the nest and the eggs
of the black bird.

739
00:48:20,084 --> 00:48:21,541
Her plan to remove it later

740
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,374
is foiled because there was
keeping watch in the garden

741
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:27,249
a police constable.

742
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,208
The body, she then drags to
the foot of the tree

743
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:34,708
to make us believe he had seen
something up there,

744
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:40,374
which brought upon
his attaque tragique.

745
00:48:42,334 --> 00:48:43,583
Ah, yes,

746
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:47,666
with the arrival
of Hercule Poirot,

747
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,124
she starts to panic

748
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,208
because she knows that
I suspect the murder.

749
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:53,333
And so she stages
the clumsy affair

750
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,958
with the chloroform
in the gas mask,

751
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:57,791
to make us believe that

752
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,749
her own life
was under threat.

753
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:05,958
All of this

754
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,833
to divert our suspicions
of the most cruel,

755
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,291
the most brutal murder

756
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,333
of her poor husband.

757
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,208
Sweet-looking
girl like that.

758
00:49:53,334 --> 00:49:56,499
Who'd have thought she could
come up with such a grisly idea?

759
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:59,833
Ah, but, Chief Inspector,
the idea did not come from her.

760
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,833
It came from her admirer
of the most ardent,

761
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,999
Captain Black.

762
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:08,708
You don't mean they were
both in on the whole thing?

763
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,958
Oh, no, no, Hastings,
the newspaper.

764
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,416
Someone just back from Africa?

765
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:18,083
That was wrapped around
the present of Captain Black,

766
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,791
on the front page
there was a story

767
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:23,374
about a farmer
in East Africa

768
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:26,999
who had killed himself
in exactly the same manner --

769
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:29,583
with a rook rifle
in the mouth.

770
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,708
You did not observe
the headline?

771
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,374
Ah, but Hercule Poirot,
he sees everything,

772
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,208
and he forgets nothing.

773
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,333
And what about the picture?

774
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,791
The shadows, Hastings.

775
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,916
They were all cast from
the right to the left.

776
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,916
-You do not see?
-Sorry, Poirot.

777
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,333
Madame! I think you'd
better come, quick!

778
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:56,083
Now, if she had truly
painted that picture

779
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:58,749
in the morning before midday
as she had claimed,

780
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,999
they would have all been cast
from the left to the right.

781
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,874
Ah! So, she'd already painted
that picture beforehand

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,374
to give herself an alibi.

783
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,583
C'est ça.

784
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,124
Well, I suppose
we better be leaving,

785
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,166
catch our train.

786
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:12,874
Oh, no, no, no, no,
Chief Inspector!

787
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,249
It is still early,

788
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,499
and the exhibits here are quite
remarkable, n'est-ce pas?

789
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:20,166
To be immortalized in such
a fashion unique.

790
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:22,041
Ah, quel honneur.

791
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:24,333
Now, I wonder what is
around here?

792
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,499
Oh, very impressive.

793
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,791
Quite incredible.

794
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,249
It's a masterpiece.

795
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,124
True work of art.

796
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,083
That's his curly hair to a T.

797
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,666
Even got the little
dimples on his cheeks.

798
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:45,208
Look, a real piece of
craftsmanship, wouldn't you say?
