1
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,458
-Yes, sir?
-Hello there.

2
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,999
You're new, aren't you?

3
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,916
Is there someone
you wanted to see, sir?

4
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,291
Well...

5
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,083
Yes, there was,
as a matter of fact.

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,083
I'd rather like
a few quick words with my wife.

7
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,124
Paper!

8
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,999
Paper!

9
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,541
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

10
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,333
Have you a suite?

11
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:00,958
Excuse me.

12
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,583
And how long
will we be having

13
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,208
the pleasure of your patronage,
M. le Comte?

14
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,583
Difficult to say.

15
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,791
I have a business in London
of an indefinite nature.

16
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,499
Have you a florist's
attached to the hotel?

17
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,749
But of course, monsieur.

18
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,416
Excellent.

19
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,374
Suite 37.

20
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,916
Flossie, darling.

21
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,833
Oh.

22
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,541
What the hell
are you doing here, Carrington?

23
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,458
Florence doesn't want to
see you.

24
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,708
I'd have thought
the letter from the lawyer

25
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,583
made that perfectly clear.

26
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,166
Well, I'm sure
we both want to spare Flossie

27
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,416
the embarrassment of airing
all our little family secrets.

28
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,999
Get out of here.

29
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,749
Rupert.
I thought it was your voice.

30
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,083
There's no need for you
to talk to him, Florence.

31
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,208
There's no need for you
to even see him.

32
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,166
But I want to talk to him,
Father.

33
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,958
Just for a moment.
Please.

34
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,374
All right.

35
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,124
One minute.

36
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,708
Then I want him
out of this house.

37
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,291
He never liked me.

38
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,208
Good heavens.

39
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,333
I can't imagine why.

40
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,624
Look, Flossie...

41
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,291
This legal separation --

42
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,916
It isn't what you want, is it?

43
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,499
Rupert...

44
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,083
The only reason I wanted to
be alone with you

45
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,916
was to be absolutely certain
I'd got you out of my system.

46
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,291
I have.

47
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,958
Goodbye, Rupert.

48
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,708
Flossie, wait.

49
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,166
Look, all right,
if that's what you really want.

50
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,333
But, look, you couldn't, um...

51
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,708
I'm in a spot of difficulty.

52
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,916
You mean money.
Not a penny of it.

53
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:25,583
You've had a good run
for my money, but now it's over.

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,374
I think you should
help me out, Flossie.

55
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,124
What were they standing at

56
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,166
at the close yesterday
in Sydney?

57
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,291
Listen, the geologist's report
is fine.

58
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,541
Couldn't be better.

59
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,499
Where do the rumors start?
Do you know?

60
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:48,833
Paris?

61
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,374
Who in Paris?

62
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,416
Look, Tommy, hold the bank off.

63
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,541
When the real
report's published,

64
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,416
those shares are gonna rocket.

65
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,791
Yeah.

66
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,249
Right.

67
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:09,833
I say.

68
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,624
Do you remember those shares
Sandy Hacket tipped me to buy?

69
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,874
Shares, Hastings?

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,249
The Australian Mining Company.
Yellow Creek.

71
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,291
He said they were about to make
some spectacular discovery.

72
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:23,541
Do not tell me, Hastings.
They are down to five shillings.

73
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,708
Three and six, actually.

74
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,249
I thought you didn't study
the stock market.

75
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,833
I do not, Hastings.
I study the psychology.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,874
M. Hacket is what we call
the congenital optimist.

77
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,666
The only occasion
on which we met,

78
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,666
he assured me
with the utmost certainty

79
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,583
that it would not rain
that afternoon

80
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,458
because he was
going to the garden party.

81
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,583
Yes, I remember.
It bucketed down.

82
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,791
A Mr. Gordon Halliday is here
to see you, Mr. Poirot.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,666
M. Gordon Halliday.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,041
Show him in, by all means,
Miss Lemon.

85
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,916
Is that the Australian
Gordon Halliday?

86
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:02,958
Mais oui.

87
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,791
The self-made millionaire
par excellence.

88
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,874
But he's the chairman
of Yellow Creek Mines.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,124
Do you think he'd advise me?

90
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,916
Hastings, I forbid you
to mention it.

91
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,208
M. Halliday is here to ask
for advice, not to give it.

92
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,999
Mr. Poirot.

93
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,791
Very good of you to see me
without an appointment.

94
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,708
Not at all, M. Halliday.
Not at all.

95
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,416
How may I be of service to you?

96
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,666
Well, actually,
it's a little awkward.

97
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,999
Flowers from M. le Comte again,
madam.

98
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,458
Not more of them.

99
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,291
What does he say this time?

100
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,833
"I'm desolated not to have heard
from you.

101
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,999
Can it possibly be that I am
condemned to take tea alone?

102
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:04,333
Have pity, my lovely Florence.
Have pity."

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,624
He hasn't changed one bit.

104
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,291
Well...

105
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,874
I could do
with a bit of cheering up.

106
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:21,208
Look, Mr. Poirot,
money's no object.

107
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,874
I want him got rid of.

108
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,833
Poirot is not in the business

109
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,833
of getting rid of people,
M. Halliday.

110
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,958
He's not only European,
M. Poirot, he's a Frenchman.

111
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,791
And he's not only a Frenchman,
he's a wrong un.

112
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,708
You see,
it's hard for poor Florence.

113
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,958
Everybody knows
she's my only heir.

114
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,624
That scares off
all the decent blokes

115
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,541
and brings
the buzzards flocking.

116
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,166
And this Comte de Rochefour
is one of the buzzards.

117
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,041
Yeah.

118
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,291
Knew it as soon as
I heard his wings

119
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,208
flapping towards us in Paris.

120
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,583
Of course, Florence thought
he was the bee's knees.

121
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,249
I had a hell of a job
getting her away from him.

122
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,541
I thought I might find her
someone more suitable

123
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,833
in English society.

124
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,833
The Honorable Rupert Carrington?

125
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,958
Yeah, well, that was
out of the frying pan,

126
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:07,583
into the fire with a vengeance.

127
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,166
And now, just as she gets him
out of her hair,

128
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,874
back out of nowhere comes
this so-called count.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,333
Staying at the Adelphi Hotel.
Spending a fortune on roses.

130
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,958
Poirot is not in the business

131
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,124
of vetting the potential
husbands, M. Halliday.

132
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,499
I cannot help you.

133
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,374
You keep telling me

134
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,916
what business you're not in,
Mr. Poirot.

135
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:31,208
Can't you just run your eye
over the pipsqueak for me?

136
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,999
You're not a father, Poirot.

137
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,958
You don't know what it's like

138
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,374
trying to bring up a daughter
all on your own.

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,541
No wife to talk it over with.
No one to ask advice.

140
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,624
Very well.

141
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,583
I will run my eye over him
for you.

142
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,374
I can tell you where he'll be
in half an hour from now.

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,124
Unless I'm
very pleasantly mistaken,

144
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,958
Florence will be there too.

145
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,583
Will you go to Crufts?

146
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,708
Crufts is about
the most exciting thing

147
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,083
in London this month.

148
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,958
No.
That is not so.

149
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,249
I was devastated
when you left Paris, Florence.

150
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,124
I was utterly destroyed.

151
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,499
Well, I'm sorry about Paris.

152
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,874
-My father --
-Ah.

153
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,999
Your father.

154
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,166
Perhaps he will look at me
in a better light this time.

155
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,291
Why?
What's different this time?

156
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,458
I have a job.

157
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:03,166
I think the First National Bank
of Paris will carry weight.

158
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,541
Even with him.

159
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:15,333
Well, Hastings,
what do your instincts tell you

160
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,833
about our so-elegant count?

161
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,749
Well, not a lot, really.

162
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,708
Just looks like a typical fro--

163
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,249
Typical Frenchman.

164
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,874
I mean typical Frenchman
of his type...

165
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,666
of Frenchman.

166
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,541
Quite so.
Quite so.

167
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,249
Typical of his type.

168
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,833
Bearer bonds?

169
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,083
Worth 20,000
of your English pounds.

170
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,333
Now, if the bank can trust me
to such an extent,

171
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,041
so can your father.

172
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,874
So can you.

173
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,458
Perhaps.

174
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,583
Is this something to do with
some financial master stroke?

175
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,874
I will tell you all about it
when we meet tomorrow.

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,791
Oh, not tomorrow, I'm afraid.

177
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,083
Tomorrow I'm going away
for the weekend.

178
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,333
I accepted an invitation
months ago.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,458
Florence, how can I possibly
be without you

180
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,333
for another three days

181
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,708
now that we have
found each other again?

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,208
Well, you can always
come and see me off

183
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:25,916
if it'll make you feel better.

184
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,833
I'm catching the 12:14
from Paddington --

185
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,583
the Plymouth Express --
and then changing at Bristol.

186
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,124
Come and wave goodbye to me.

187
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,791
It is only for three days.

188
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,958
Which of the jewels
shall I pack, madam?

189
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,041
Oh, I can't decide.

190
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,249
I'll take the jewel case
with everything.

191
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,958
Do you think that's wise,
Miss Florence?

192
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,541
Florence, now just --

193
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,499
Oh, do you have to wear those?

194
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,083
With this?
Don't be silly, Father.

195
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:20,208
-Pack these, Jane.
-Do you have to take them all?

196
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:27,374
Daddy, you really do
have to stop worrying about me.

197
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,333
Be a dear.
Help Jane with the cases.

198
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,416
Hmm.

199
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,208
150,000 shares, Comte?

200
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,958
150,000.

201
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,291
The Yellow Creek
Mining Corporation.

202
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,583
To be sold when they reach £1.

203
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,791
It's my security.

204
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,708
Porter.

205
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,291
Be careful with that.
It's a heavy one.

206
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,083
The train
now standing on platform one

207
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,749
is the 12:14 Plymouth Express
via Bristol.

208
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,708
The 12:14 Plymouth Express
via Bristol

209
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,416
will depart from platform one.

210
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,583
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
I stayed with you, madam?

211
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,708
Quite sure.
You go and find your own seat.

212
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,291
Are you expecting company,
madam?

213
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,791
Of course not.
Why on earth should I be?

214
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:41,958
Excuse me.

215
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:44,666
Do you know if that clock
is correct?

216
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,624
No idea, I'm afraid, my dear.

217
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,541
Is Poirot in?

218
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,749
I want to see him!

219
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,208
-Right -- Right this minute.
-Mr. Halliday! Really!

220
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,124
Florence has disappeared.

221
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,958
You've got to
do something, Poirot.

222
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,666
She just disappeared
into thin air.

223
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,166
Now, calm yourself, M. Halliday.

224
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,208
How can I?!

225
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,833
I knew something like this
would happen.

226
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,083
Tell me.

227
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,749
She was going away
for the weekend.

228
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,749
Her maid's just called
from Bristol station.

229
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,416
They were supposed to
change there,

230
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,458
only, apparently, Florence
stayed on the train.

231
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:14,249
Said she had some business
further on.

232
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,458
Now, did she specify
what business?

233
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,124
No, no,
she just said that

234
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,083
she'd get the first train
back to Bristol,

235
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:21,333
and then they'd go on together.

236
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,374
Well, that is not necessarily
to worry, my friend.

237
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,458
But that was
over three hours ago, Poirot.

238
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,958
There's still no sign of her.

239
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,333
I see.

240
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,249
What really worries me
is that when the maid went along

241
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,791
to Florence's compartment
at Bristol,

242
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:37,208
there was a man in it with her.

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,583
Train now arriving
on platform one

244
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,499
is the 12:14 from Paddington.

245
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,249
This is Plymouth.
Plymouth station.

246
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,583
The train now arriving
on platform one

247
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,374
is the 12:14 from Paddington.

248
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,624
Going on to Penzance,
are you, sir?

249
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,583
Paper! Paper!
Extra! Extra!

250
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,416
Body found on train!

251
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:47,374
Paper! Paper!
Extra! Extra!

252
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,958
What's it all for, Poirot?

253
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:12,708
You're a clever man.
You tell me that.

254
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:17,916
My dear friend.
I am so very, very sorry.

255
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,624
You find her murderer, Poirot,

256
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,333
I'll make you richer
than you ever dreamed.

257
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,291
Halliday, my friend,
it is not a question of money.

258
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,333
Believe me,
I also shall not rest

259
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,083
until the murderer
is brought to justice.

260
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,708
Now, it is essential
that I speak with the maid

261
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,333
at the earliest possible moment.

262
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,166
She's in the breakfast room.

263
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,416
The police are questioning her
right this minute.

264
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,249
I tell you,
I never saw his face.

265
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,166
That's a bit hard to credit.

266
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,458
Well, she made sure
that I didn't.

267
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,541
Mrs. Carrington.

268
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,874
She was standing in the doorway
when we got to Bristol

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,583
with the luggage already
out in the corridor.

270
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,041
I just caught a glimpse of him
over her shoulder.

271
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,416
He had his back to me.

272
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,999
Well, you must have
noticed something.

273
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,458
I told you.
He was tall.

274
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:13,958
He had on a dark suit.

275
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,666
And I think...

276
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,666
I'm almost positive
that his hair was dark too,

277
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,708
but that's all I remember.

278
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,041
Hello, Poirot.
Hastings.

279
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,708
I heard you were here.
Nasty business, this.

280
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,749
Oui, d'accord.

281
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,166
A genuine tragedy.

282
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,833
If I may?

283
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,208
Mademoiselle.

284
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,208
Did he seem to you
in any way familiar?

285
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,416
No, I don't...

286
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,166
I don't think he did.

287
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,541
Could it have been
Mrs. Carrington's husband?

288
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:50,749
Well, I only saw him once.

289
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:55,166
I suppose it could have been.

290
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:59,166
Have you ever met a man
who calls himself

291
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,249
le Comte de Rochefour?

292
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,333
-No, sir.
-Bien.

293
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,458
Thank you very much,
mademoiselle.

294
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,583
So...

295
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,833
After you'd caught a glimpse
of this man

296
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,541
you might or might not have
seen before, then what happened?

297
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,999
I told you.

298
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,916
Mrs. Carrington said
she had business on the train

299
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,833
and that I was to take
the luggage and wait for her.

300
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,708
Mr. Halliday tells me
that Mrs. Carrington

301
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:34,291
had a lot of jewelry with her in
a blue morocco traveling case.

302
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,416
That wasn't with the stuff
you took off the train?

303
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,624
Oh, no, sir.
She kept that with her.

304
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,708
What do you think, Poirot?

305
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,708
I presume that the
traveling case of blue morocco

306
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,083
was not discovered
with the body.

307
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:51,874
You presume 100% correct.

308
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,249
Mind you, that doesn't
necessarily signify.

309
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,541
For whatever reason the murderer
had for killing her,

310
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,541
he'd be a fool to let a bag full
of valuable jewelry go begging.

311
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,208
Or perhaps he took it
to distract us

312
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,374
from his real motive.

313
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,791
Taxi!

314
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,916
How long had she been dead

315
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,916
when the body was discovered
at Plymouth?

316
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,124
About three hours,
the doctor says.

317
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,624
After Bristol,
the train stops at Weston,

318
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,708
then not again until Taunton.

319
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,833
According to the pathologist,

320
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,041
she was killed soon after
the train left Weston,

321
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,124
at the very latest.

322
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,458
Possibly before.

323
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,291
Before the train
reached Weston even?

324
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,374
Could be.

325
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,374
The train for Plymouth
departs from Paddington station

326
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,166
at 14 minutes past 12:00,
does it not?

327
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,958
12:14, yes.

328
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,624
Hastings, what do you say

329
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,833
to an invigorating ride
into the West Country?

330
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,583
Weston station.
Dead on time.

331
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,833
Exactly 25 past 3:00.

332
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,583
Excellent.

333
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,833
And exactly 35 minutes
after leaving Bristol,

334
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,416
at which time yesterday

335
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,874
Mme. Carrington
was alive and well.

336
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,874
The question is, Hastings,

337
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:59,249
was Mme. Carrington still alive
and well at this moment?

338
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,083
And if she was alive and well,
did she remain in the carriage

339
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,499
or did she descend from
the train onto the platform,

340
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:12,208
perhaps to stretch the legs,
take in the fresh air?

341
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,791
And did anybody see her
doing it?

342
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:17,083
Précisément.

343
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,166
-Perhaps we should ask a porter.
-Papers!

344
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,666
Yes, we could.
Or...

345
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:26,916
Or possibly, Hastings...

346
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,666
Papers! Papers!
Get your papers here!

347
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,166
Papers!

348
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:38,333
Excuse me.

349
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,499
No, no, no, no.
No. No, thank you.

350
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,999
You have the appearance of
a bright, observant young lad.

351
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,124
That's what my mum says.

352
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:48,624
Tell me.

353
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,083
I want you to try to remember,

354
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,166
at precisely
this time yesterday,

355
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,874
did you see descending
from the train a woman?

356
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,208
A handsome young woman
in a blue --

357
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,749
a blue hat and coat, perhaps?

358
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,041
She bought a newspaper
off you, huh?

359
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:07,166
-You mean the Australian lady.
-So you remember her?

360
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:08,624
I couldn't forget her, gov.

361
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,958
Not with all the fuss
she was making.

362
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,333
-Fuss?
-Yeah.

363
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:14,249
She kept going on about wanting
a late edition of the paper.

364
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,541
Any paper.

365
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,583
Well, I told her
I only had the early edition,

366
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,833
but she wouldn't believe me.

367
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,916
Kept going on, saying,
"I must have one,"

368
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:22,374
as though her life
were at stake.

369
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,749
I see -- Pardon.

370
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,166
-And, uh...
-Come, children.

371
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:28,874
Did she give to you any reason

372
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,666
why she was so desperate
to acquire this late edition?

373
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,374
No, she just kept saying,
"He'll be so angry,"

374
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,166
and looking back at the train

375
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,041
like someone was on it
waiting for her.

376
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,749
-And then?
-Well, nothing.

377
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,958
She just kept going on and on

378
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,541
until she nearly
missed her train.

379
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,291
She only just managed
to jump back on it

380
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,374
as it was moving.

381
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,166
Thank you very much.

382
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:07,583
Early edition, late edition,
early edition, late edition.

383
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,666
Superbe, Miss Lemon.

384
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,541
I knew
that you could arrange it.

385
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,708
Difficulties are made
to be overcome, Mr. Poirot.

386
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,541
"Difficulties are made
to be overcome."

387
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,874
What a truly magnificent
attitude.

388
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,791
So, Hastings,
let us divide these between us

389
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,666
and examine them minutely.

390
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,666
Inspector Japp.

391
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,708
-Chief Inspector.
-Poirot.

392
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:49,541
Hello. What's this?
You looking for a job?

393
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,083
No, I know. You've had a chat
with that newsboy.

394
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,083
You think
there's something in it?

395
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,416
That is what we are trying
to discover, Chief Inspector.

396
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,541
Hmm.

397
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,958
Well, I just thought
I'd come and tell you,

398
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,083
you could be on the right track
with that French gent.

399
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,583
Apparently, he left the Adelphi
at 11:00 yesterday morning,

400
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:15,249
an hour before the express
left Paddington,

401
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,874
and didn't get back
till gone 10:00 in the evening.

402
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,041
And nobody has any idea
where he spent the day.

403
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,249
However, we picked him up

404
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,458
trying to catch the boat train
this morning.

405
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:28,874
We just stopped him
for questioning,

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,708
and he made a run for it.

407
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:43,791
He's down at the station now.

408
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,541
These papers have probably got
nothing to do with it.

409
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,458
Oh, no, no, no, Chief Inspector.

410
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,041
When we shall discover
why Mme. Carrington

411
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,166
was so anxious to acquire
a late edition...

412
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,374
...then we shall know
why she was killed...

413
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,166
...and who is responsible.

414
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:15,499
Another one.

415
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,291
I don't think I can,
Mr. Carrington.

416
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,749
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,958
What do you mean,
don't think you can?

418
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,291
Well, for one thing, sir,
I think you've had enough.

419
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,458
And for another, there is
the question of your bill.

420
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,541
-Who are you?
-Arthur Hastings.

421
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,541
You know this fellow won't give
me a drink, Arthur Hastings.

422
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,374
Really?

423
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,624
Well, perhaps I'll have
more luck.

424
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,541
Two large Scotches, please.

425
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,374
Had a bit of luck
at Ascot yesterday.

426
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,624
Don't talk to me about Ascot.
Horses.

427
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,499
What were you on in the 3:30?

428
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,749
I bet you were on
Highland Laddie.

429
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,208
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

430
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,666
I hate people like you.

431
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,124
33 to 1.

432
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:58,874
I put my shirt on Rising Star.

433
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,624
Rising Star.

434
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,249
Every penny I had in the world
on that nag.

435
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,791
My last chance.

436
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:11,374
Must have given you
a nasty shock

437
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,999
when you read the result
in the paper.

438
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,499
Shock?

439
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,374
Do you know why I'm here?

440
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:19,999
This is the only place I know

441
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,833
where my bookmaker
can't get at me.

442
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,124
I mean, I don't want to
sit here drinking.

443
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,124
I actually dislike drink.
Do you know that?

444
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,916
Why did you back
Highland Laddie?

445
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,208
Oh, I had a tip.

446
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,458
I really dislike people
who get tips.

447
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,374
Thank you.

448
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,499
You're a good chap, though.
You've got to be fair.

449
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,833
How did you know
I read about it in the paper?

450
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,124
Oh, you said.

451
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,791
You said
you weren't at the course.

452
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,333
Did I say that?
You are a good chap.

453
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:02,874
Every penny I had.
I looked at that newspaper.

454
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,749
I could be a success, you know,
if I just had the capital.

455
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,249
And tips.

456
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:14,374
Isn't there anyone you could
go to for capital?

457
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:19,541
Not a soul in the world.
Not now.

458
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,333
I don't want to talk about that.

459
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,249
I demand to see
the French consul.

460
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,041
All in good time, M. le Comte.

461
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,458
This is a serious business.

462
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,249
I know nothing of the death of
Mrs. Carrington, I tell you.

463
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,499
I am devastated by it.

464
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,916
I'm rather more interested
in these things for the moment.

465
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,749
Mr. Halliday is here, sir.

466
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,749
-Show him in.
-Very good, sir.

467
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,916
Mr. Halliday.

468
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,208
M. Halliday,
I am devastated for you.

469
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:23,583
Now, the count says
he last saw your daughter

470
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,624
when he had tea with her
at the Adelphi on Wednesday.

471
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,374
Yeah, he did have tea with her.

472
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,916
One interesting thing, though,
Mr. Halliday,

473
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,624
is that he had these with him.

474
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,708
Bearer bonds.

475
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,624
And what the count
can't tell us, you see,

476
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,291
is what sort of financial
dealings would require him

477
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,166
to bring £20,000 worth
of these bonds into England

478
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:45,166
and then take them back again
to Paris three days later.

479
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,583
Well, he was obviously
using them as security.

480
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,291
Security for what?

481
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,083
That is my bank's business.

482
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,499
Not according to them,
it isn't, sir.

483
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,916
I rang them up, you see?

484
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,041
They're quite anxious
to have a word with you.

485
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,583
What, uh --
What bank are we talking about?

486
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,999
The International Bank of Paris.

487
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,083
Wait a minute.

488
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,083
I know what he wanted
the security for.

489
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,124
10 days ago,
somebody started a rumor

490
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:17,583
that a geologist's report
on one of my mines

491
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:19,374
was gonna be unfavorable.

492
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,499
The shares plummeted.

493
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,083
You must have made
a real killing.

494
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,958
He'd have bought the shares
at about three shillings

495
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:31,958
and sold them the day after
the real report came out

496
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,583
and they went back up again
to about 20.

497
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,833
Making about £100,000.

498
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,374
This sounds like something
for the fraud department.

499
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,749
Fraud?

500
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:48,124
What fraud?

501
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:53,208
It's normal business practice.

502
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:58,333
No wonder you were so anxious
to get hold of a late edition.

503
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,458
He went down to Ascot,

504
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,208
put everything he had
on Rising Star.

505
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:07,874
As soon as he knew
the horse had lost,

506
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,249
he asked Florence for a loan.

507
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,124
She refused him.

508
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,708
Right, Poirot,
the frog's cracked.

509
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:12,749
I knew it.

510
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,958
What he was reckoning was
he'd use Mrs. Carrington

511
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:16,791
as a backup
in case his deal went wrong.

512
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,249
No, no, no. He lost every penny
he had at the races.

513
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,541
-Races? Who had? What races?
-Rupert Carrington.

514
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,583
No, no, it's got nothing
to do with Carrington.

515
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:25,041
Please, please, please,
my friends.

516
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,416
If you please.

517
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,374
How can I possibly arbitrate

518
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,916
between your two
ingenious theories

519
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:33,333
if I can hardly distinguish
one word of them?

520
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:38,208
Now, Chief Inspector,
your theory, as I understand it,

521
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,249
is that the Comte de Rochefour

522
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,249
intended to use Mme. Carrington
as a fall back on.

523
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,124
If the takeover deal
went wrong,

524
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,583
he would then demand of her
the money

525
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:48,833
in order to redeem the bonds.

526
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:49,874
He's admitted as much.

527
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,749
But the deal,
it did not go wrong, did it?

528
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:55,416
So why should the count kill for
the jewels of Mme. Carrington?

529
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:58,999
Whereas, Hastings, your theory
is that when M. Carrington

530
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,958
discovered that his certain
winner fell at the last fence,

531
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,124
he then demanded from his wife
the money

532
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,958
in order to remove the threat
of the bookmakers.

533
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:09,249
And when she refused,
he killed her for her jewelry.

534
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,124
Exactly.

535
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,874
Then you tell me, Hastings,

536
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,249
why does M. Carrington
still lurk about his club,

537
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,458
drinking himself into oblivion
and shaking with fear

538
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:21,791
of what they might do to him,
these very same bookmakers?

539
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,291
Bon.

540
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:27,166
These feverish speculations,
they will not do.

541
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,624
Order and method
will be our guides.

542
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,249
Now, I have been consulting

543
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:35,083
the admirable files
of Miss Lemon.

544
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:37,874
So, Chief Inspector,
get four of your best men

545
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,958
and meet us at this address
at 9:00.

546
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,499
Find the jewels,
and you'll find the killer.

547
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,708
What's happening?

548
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:37,958
Nothing.

549
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:43,749
He's knocking at the door.

550
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:48,374
Hold on.
Someone's answered.

551
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:56,666
He's gone in.

552
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,249
I wish I knew what he was up to.

553
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:10,708
I'm not quite clear
what this is about, Mister...

554
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,249
A friend advised me
to get in touch with you.

555
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,874
Friend?
What friend?

556
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,416
He prefers to remain anonymous.

557
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:19,291
Oh, yes.

558
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:23,541
I don't think
I care for anonymous friends.

559
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,666
My friend is anxious
to buy some jewelry.

560
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,583
Plenty of shops around.

561
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:36,999
You look like a jeweler.

562
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:41,249
You're very acute, monsieur.

563
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,999
Very well.

564
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,374
Perhaps you read
of the jewelry robbery

565
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,458
the day before yesterday
on the Plymouth Express?

566
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,333
I don't read that sort of trash.

567
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,166
You are very wise, monsieur.

568
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,666
There is blood on those jewels.

569
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,166
It will make them
very hard to sell.

570
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:06,249
You're a funny little fellow,
aren't you?

571
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,624
What are you?

572
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,291
Montenegrin? Polish?

573
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,249
Belgian, M. McKenzie.

574
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,916
You see, those jewels
will have to be broken up,

575
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,833
removed from their setting.

576
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,624
And whoever tries to sell them

577
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:29,124
will be lucky to receive
one-sixth of their true value.

578
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,249
I don't know
what your game is, monsieur.

579
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:35,708
I really don't.

580
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:38,541
My friend
is a truly private collector.

581
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,041
He would not be so fussy.

582
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,166
He would not care if the jewelry

583
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:49,624
were left
in its original condition.

584
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,541
In fact, he would prefer it.

585
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,208
Let's hope it stays fine
for him.

586
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:00,666
You got the wrong shop.

587
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,791
None of this
means anything to me.

588
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,291
I see.

589
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:21,666
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.

590
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:27,124
We all have false hopes,
M. McKenzie.

591
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,374
How'd it go, Poirot?

592
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:14,833
It is him.

593
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,541
He denies all knowledge,
of course.

594
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,124
But there is on the coat rack

595
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,708
a duplicate of the coat
Mme. Carrington was wearing

596
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,166
at the time of her death.

597
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,833
Why did he need a duplicate?

598
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,583
For his accomplice to wear,
Hastings.

599
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,124
I didn't know
he had an accomplice.

600
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,249
But of course he did.

601
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,249
That is how
I was able to locate him.

602
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,624
Right.
Come on, lads.

603
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,583
This is the police!
Open this door!

604
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,749
All right.
Break the door down.

605
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:16,166
Mr. Halliday's dining.

606
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:23,541
I want a word with you,
Mr. Halliday.

607
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,958
You weren't welcome
when my daughter was alive.

608
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,416
You're even less welcome now.

609
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,458
I don't care
if I'm welcome or not.

610
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,124
Why should you have
an easy conscience?

611
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,874
This horror
would never have happened

612
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,416
if you hadn't come between
Flossie and me.

613
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,666
The only thing that came between
you and Florence

614
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,124
was your character.

615
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,666
She saw you for what you were.

616
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,208
No, she saw
what you wanted her to see.

617
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,583
You could never let her go,
could you?

618
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,541
Yeah, what is it, Mason?

619
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,791
It's the inspector
from Scotland Yard, sir.

620
00:41:58,209 --> 00:41:59,624
And a lot of other people.

621
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,708
Do we have to talk about this?

622
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,499
I am afraid that we do,
M. Halliday.

623
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,916
Does no good.

624
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,208
Okay. Go on.

625
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:29,541
I still don't understand the
business about the newspapers.

626
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,708
Neither did I at first,
my friend.

627
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,791
Why should Florence
be so desperate

628
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:36,666
to procure this newspaper?

629
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,833
Please, mademoiselle, allow me.

630
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,458
Perhaps her companion was a man
who was desperate to know

631
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,874
the results
of a particular race.

632
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,541
Thank you, mademoiselle.

633
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,124
Or perhaps
her companion was a man

634
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,083
who desperately needed to know
the close-of-day figures

635
00:43:10,209 --> 00:43:11,499
on the stock market.

636
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:14,291
Absurd.

637
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,249
I tormented my brain.

638
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,458
I agitated the little gray cells
without mercy.

639
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:28,541
Why did Florence Carrington so
desperately want that newspaper?

640
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,291
And what was the answer?

641
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:36,458
The answer. The answer,
my friend, was that she did not.

642
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,333
Now, once this idea presented
itself to me,

643
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:41,583
the truth,
it soon became very clear.

644
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:44,874
You see, I knew Florence was
murdered because of her jewels,

645
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,666
but I also knew something
about the man who killed her.

646
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,041
Knew what?

647
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:51,166
The man I was looking for

648
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,541
had to be a thief
of the most steelhearted,

649
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:56,249
one capable of committing
the senseless murder

650
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,041
of an innocent young woman.

651
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,624
So I looked in the files of
Miss Lemon, and what do I find?

652
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,749
I find a jewel thief

653
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,749
by the name of McKenzie.

654
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,541
A plan is devised

655
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,124
which will suggest
that the theft of the jewels

656
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,833
are not the principal cause
of the crime

657
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,791
that is to take place.

658
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:35,249
That color really suits you.

659
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:44,916
Florence Carrington
is traveling with the jewels

660
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:48,041
alone and unprotected
on the Plymouth Express.

661
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:51,749
M. McKenzie has also boarded
the train at Paddington.

662
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,249
Just as the train reaches
Bristol station,

663
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:00,916
he advances
towards her carriage.

664
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,999
Aah!

665
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,333
Oh!

666
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:50,208
The train arrives at Bristol.

667
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,708
M. McKenzie descends
from the train

668
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,916
carrying with him
not only the jewels

669
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:58,791
but also the baggage
of Mme. Carrington.

670
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,874
Now, if anybody had looked
at the carriage

671
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,999
as the train
left Bristol station,

672
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,374
they would have noticed
Mme. Carrington alive and well.

673
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,749
Indeed, at Weston

674
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,708
she apparently descended from
the train onto the platform,

675
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,166
where she made a great fuss

676
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,416
about acquiring
the late edition.

677
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:18,291
But this was to ensure

678
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,874
that the newspaper boy
would remember her.

679
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,458
Hang on a minute.

680
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:24,291
The pathologist said
she was dead

681
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,916
before the train reached Weston.

682
00:46:26,042 --> 00:46:27,249
Maybe even before Bristol.

683
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,874
Précisément, mon ami.

684
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:31,208
So how is this possible?

685
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,458
Do we believe in ghosts?

686
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,124
No.

687
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:39,916
No, we do not.

688
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,458
It was not poor Mlle. Florence

689
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:48,416
who was seen traveling
on the train to Weston.

690
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,041
It was not Mlle. Florence

691
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,833
who made at Weston station
the fracas.

692
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:56,291
It was the accomplice
of M. McKenzie,

693
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,499
wearing the duplicate blue coat.

694
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,124
To kill a fellow human being
is vile, my friends.

695
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,583
But I wonder if to kill a fellow
human being with a knife

696
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,291
is not the most vile.

697
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,583
You look a proper lady.

698
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,333
To see the eyes of
the victim staring into yours,

699
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,666
to feel the breath
upon her face,

700
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,374
the scrape of the knifepoint
between her ribs.

701
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,791
You see, the ruthless accomplice
of M. McKenzie

702
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:35,999
was a woman called Grace Kidd,

703
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,124
who was employed
by Mme. Carrington

704
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,833
under the name of Jane Mason.

705
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,958
Tell me, mademoiselle,

706
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,666
was it absolutely necessary

707
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:50,749
for a poor, wretched woman --

708
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:53,958
who had never done to you
one moment's harm -- to die?

709
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,708
Was there no other way?

710
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,624
Oh, my God!

711
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:10,416
Those jewels would have set us
up for the rest of our lives.

712
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,541
Why take chances?

713
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,749
Right.
That'll be enough of that.

714
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,499
Take her away, lads.

715
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,458
Poor Florence.

716
00:48:28,084 --> 00:48:30,124
Poor, dear Florence.

717
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:38,749
We found the jewel case in
McKenzie's house, Mr. Halliday.

718
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,083
They're not mine.

719
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,166
I know the contents
of my daughter's will.

720
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,374
They belong
to that creature there.

721
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:54,958
No.

722
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,124
No, I don't want them.

723
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,708
I'm not going to profit
by Flossie's death.

724
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,166
Most sad.

725
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,624
Most sad.

726
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,499
I shall go now, I think.

727
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:35,124
Oh, you think so, do you?

728
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,249
You may not be a murderer,
M. le Comte,

729
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,374
but you're still a swindler.

730
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,166
You're coming back
to Scotland Yard.

731
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:59,666
Dear Mr. Poirot,

732
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:01,874
I would like to express
my gratitude

733
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,583
for your help
in this tragic business.

734
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:07,583
Your logical
and businesslike approach

735
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:11,333
was something I could cling to
in the depths of my despair.

736
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:13,666
I hope sometime in the future

737
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,874
to be able to find a measure
of such quiet strength.

738
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,999
Then, perhaps,
I can start again.

739
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:25,791
I'm returning home
to the memory of happier times.

740
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:30,666
Old friends may help me
live with the past.

741
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:36,333
Poor M. Halliday.

742
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,749
He says in his letter that
he will return to Australia,

743
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,333
immerse himself in his work,
and try to forget.

744
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,541
He has been most excessive
in his generosity.

745
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,249
Poor man.
