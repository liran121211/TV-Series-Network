1
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,749
You're not serious.

2
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,499
You can't be.

3
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,249
It was a joke, that's all.

4
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:53,958
I was joking.

5
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,916
We are English, for God's sake.

6
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,291
My God.

7
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,708
Fertig?

8
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,124
Ready?

9
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,749
Los!

10
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,624
I never knew you were so keen
on opera, Poirot.

11
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,624
Generally, mon ami, I am not,
but the Rigoletto.

12
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,416
The father who is jealous.

13
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,833
His daughter, she is dishonored,

14
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,791
so he plans the murder parfait,

15
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,999
but he has failed to understand
the psychology,

16
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
and the result, catastrophe.

17
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,124
That is what interests me.

18
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,833
Well, it does have a couple
of good tunes, I suppose.

19
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,666
M. Poirot.

20
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:12,291
M. Poirot, I hope you'll
forgive me intruding like this,

21
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,791
but when I saw you,
I couldn't believe it.

22
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,791
It is Lady Chatterton,
is it not?

23
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,499
You remember me!

24
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,291
Oh, but then,
of course, you would.

25
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,291
I was there when you solved
the Chalfont Diamonds case.

26
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,833
I was one of the suspects.

27
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,208
It was so thrilling,
and I have to say,

28
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,374
M. Poirot,
you were magnificent.

29
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,958
Yes.

30
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,333
I've never forgotten
seeing you at work.

31
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,249
That's what made me wonder...

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,874
There is something troubling
you, Lady Chatterton?

33
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,208
Yes, there is.
Not me, you understand.

34
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,916
My friend, Mrs. Clayton.

35
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,208
I'm sure she's in danger,
M. Poirot.

36
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,624
Is that Mr. Clayton with her?

37
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,666
Oh, no, no, just a friend.
That's Major Rich.

38
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,291
Could you call on me tomorrow?

39
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,416
I'm sure
you're a busy man, but...

40
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,958
Lady Chatterton,
I will call on you

41
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
at 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,499
Thank you, M. Poirot.

43
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:26,499
Marguerite Clayton is one
of my dearest friends.

44
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,958
As you saw,
she's a very beautiful woman,

45
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,333
notoriously so.

46
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,374
It is said that 10 years ago,

47
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,541
two of her admirers actually
fought a duel over her.

48
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,791
-In England?
-Yes.

49
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,916
Nobody understood why
she chose Edward Clayton.

50
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,749
She could have married anybody.

51
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,291
He has a violent temper,
M. Poirot.

52
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:07,874
Marguerite lives
in constant fear of him,

53
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,791
and recently, his behavior
has become very strange.

54
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,041
So quiet, so detached,

55
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,749
as if he were
planning something.

56
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:21,833
M. Poirot,

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,874
I think Edward Clayton
is going to murder his wife.

58
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,583
Yes, sir?

59
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,249
Good morning.
I wonder if you can help me.

60
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,541
There's something
I'm looking for,

61
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,999
but I don't quite know
how to describe it.

62
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,374
It's a type of knife.

63
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,458
Edward?

64
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,999
You're early.

65
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,166
Yes. I won't be able to come
to Major Rich's this evening,

66
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,249
Marguerite.

67
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,708
Why can't you come tonight?

68
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,166
I have to go to Edinburgh.

69
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,166
There have been
some complications

70
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,541
in the Gordon case.

71
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,458
Can't your clerk sort it out?

72
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,666
No, it needs
my personal attention,

73
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,583
but I'm sure you'll enjoy
yourselves without me.

74
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,874
Would you prefer it
if I didn't go?

75
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,749
No, I'd prefer it if you went.

76
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,041
I don't see why you should
sit in by yourself.

77
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:42,583
Have you told Major Rich?

78
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,791
No, I'll look in this afternoon.

79
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,291
I'm at the club until 4:00,

80
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,833
but I can call in
on my way to the station.

81
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,458
Well, if that's
what you want, Edward.

82
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,666
Yes, that's what I want.

83
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,291
Have a lovely time.

84
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,291
Well, it's none of
my business what you do.

85
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,124
You've told her
you're going to Scotland?

86
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,083
I just don't know if I can
go through with this, Curtiss.

87
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,749
You want to know, don't you?

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,249
Do I?

89
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,708
These last six months,

90
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,041
you've looked
as if you're wasting away.

91
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,666
I know.

92
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,916
I keep stepping back and saying,
"This is madness."

93
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:51,833
Well?

94
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,333
I will do it.

95
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,791
I'll do it.

96
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,499
That's four
and ninepence, gov.

97
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,583
Thank you.

98
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,791
Good afternoon, Burgoyne.

99
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,624
Good afternoon, sir.

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,249
Is Major Rich in?

101
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:30,916
I'm sorry, sir.

102
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,749
Major Rich has been out
since early this morning.

103
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,666
Did he say what time
he'd be back?

104
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,874
No, sir.

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,541
I don't think
he'll be long, though.

106
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,499
All right, I'll wait.
If he doesn't come back

107
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,499
in a few minutes,
I'll leave a note for him.

108
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,166
Certainly, sir.
May I fetch you a pen?

109
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,624
No, it's all right.
I have one.

110
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,874
Thank you.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,749
You can just get on
with your duties, Burgoyne.

112
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,666
I'll leave a note for him
in the sitting room.

113
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,374
Very good, sir.

114
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,041
I'd like a word with you,
Major Rich.

115
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,416
Mrs. Clayton...

116
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:59,416
is a very old and dear friend
of mine, Major.

117
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,416
There's been a lot of talk
about you and her.

118
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,374
Too much talk, Rich.

119
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,041
Now, look, Curtiss,

120
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,749
I don't know what any of this
has to do with you.

121
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,124
As much or as little

122
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,499
as I choose.

123
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,541
Mrs. Clayton finds your
attentions offensive, sir.

124
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:25,791
Now, just you listen to me...

125
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,541
No, no, no. Your attentions
are unwelcome, Major.

126
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,958
Just get that into your head,
will you?

127
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,624
If they continue,

128
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,499
I should be obliged to put
an end to them myself.

129
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,541
You understand?

130
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,416
Good afternoon, sir.

131
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,999
Oh, hello, Burgoyne.

132
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,916
I believe Mr. Clayton
is waiting for you

133
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,374
in the sitting room, sir.

134
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,749
Clayton?

135
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,749
Yes, sir.

136
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,791
Hmm.

137
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,333
No, there's no one here.

138
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,291
Said he would wait for a few
minutes and then leave a note,

139
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:34,916
but I didn't hear him go, sir.

140
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,208
How much longer
is Miss Lemon on holiday?

141
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,916
I can't make head or tail
of her filing system.

142
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,999
She is in Frinton for
one more week, mon ami.

143
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,666
What is it
that you are looking for?

144
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,708
I thought we might
have something

145
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,208
on this Edward Clayton.

146
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,791
You're looking very smart.

147
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,166
Thank you, mon ami.

148
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:06,499
I'm going to a party
with Lady Chatterton.

149
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,541
I'm going to meet
the sinister Edward Clayton.

150
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,666
I suppose you think
he'll take one look at you

151
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,749
and change his mind
about murdering his wife.

152
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,458
All things are possible.

153
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,916
Come on, Poirot, admit it.

154
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,999
You're only going so you can be
fussed over by Lady Chatterton.

155
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,208
You took this case on

156
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,041
simply because of the way
she buttered you up.

157
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,791
You think it is wrong,
Hastings,

158
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,499
to enjoy the compliments,
or the buttering, as you say?

159
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,874
No, but, uh,

160
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,374
do you have to show it
quite so much?

161
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,749
It's not English.

162
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
Perhaps it is Belgian.

163
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,374
Hastings, why should
I be the hypocrite,

164
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,124
to blush when I am praised
and to say,

165
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,374
like you, "It is nothing."

166
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,249
I have the order, the mettle,

167
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,208
and the psychology.

168
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,583
There, I admit it.
I am the best.

169
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:52,374
I am Hercule Poirot,

170
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,666
and now I think
it is time for me to go.

171
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,624
A perfect gentleman
must not keep waiting a lady.

172
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,208
There is Mme. Clayton.

173
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,041
Yes.

174
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,833
I can't see her husband, though.

175
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,208
She is speaking

176
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:51,749
with her friend,
Major Rich, yes?

177
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,708
Caroline,
so glad you could come.

178
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,208
John.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,291
This is Hercule Poirot,
a friend of mine.

180
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,666
Major Rich.

181
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,916
Hercule Poirot.
I know that name.

182
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,333
Ah.

183
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:07,874
You're the writer.

184
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,541
No.

185
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:12,666
Where's Edward?

186
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,833
He, uh, couldn't make it,
I'm afraid.

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,249
Oh.

188
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,083
Are you over here
on holiday, Mr. Poirot?

189
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,458
No.
I live here.

190
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,458
Ah. Well, have a drink.
It's all very informal.

191
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,874
Thank you.

192
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,624
Lady Chatterton.

193
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,249
-Merci.
-Merci.

194
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,583
I'm so sorry, M. Poirot.
Edward Clayton's not here.

195
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,374
Eh bien,
I can relax and enjoy myself.

196
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,458
Indeed.

197
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,458
...to see you here,
Colonel Curtiss.

198
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,999
So, do you wish to withdraw
the invitation?

199
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,999
No.

200
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,458
Mary used to love dancing.

201
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,124
John lost his wife
a few months ago.

202
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,666
My condolences, Major Rich.

203
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,583
Edward hates this modern music.

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,749
It's just as well he's not here.

205
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,041
Your husband,

206
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,083
he is unwell, madame?

207
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,124
No.
He has business in Scotland.

208
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,749
Ah, and does he
abandon you very often,

209
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,083
your husband?

210
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,416
I can assure you that, normally,

211
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,249
Mr. Clayton keeps
a firm grip on Mrs. Clayton.

212
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,833
A stranglehold, you mean.

213
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,999
Put on something
with a bit of a fizz.

214
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,958
"These Foolish Things"?

215
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,333
No!

216
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,291
"Nobody's Sweetheart"?

217
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,374
Yes, that will do.

218
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,708
Music for second-rate people

219
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,624
provided by
the inferior races, what?

220
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,499
That is not a very pleasant
thing to say, monsieur.

221
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,541
You're not dancing,
M. Poirot.

222
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,458
Oh, no, no, no, Lady Chatterton.

223
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,666
This music is for
the young people,

224
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,749
with the limbs that are supple.

225
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,958
I'm sure
you're a wonderful dancer.

226
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,833
No, no, no, no, truly.

227
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:34,999
But tell me, madame,

228
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,791
who is that unpleasant man over
there with the walking stick?

229
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,791
Unpleasant?
Colonel Curtiss?

230
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,666
He's an old friend
of Marguerite's.

231
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,374
Why do you say "unpleasant"?

232
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,166
Now, come along, M. Poirot.

233
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,874
I insist.

234
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,499
Oh!

235
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,833
Charleston.

236
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,416
This, I cannot drink.

237
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,708
There must be no more than three
spoons of sugar in my tisane.

238
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,041
That is the way
Miss Lemon prepares it.

239
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,583
I put three spoons in.

240
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,583
Then Miss Lemon must use
a spoon that is smaller.

241
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,708
I'll get it.

242
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:24,124
Chief Inspector.

243
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,708
Hastings.

244
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,041
Morning, Poirot.

245
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,083
Ah, Chief Inspector Japp,
bonjour.

246
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,041
You're on a matter
of importance, yes?

247
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,666
For you are up with the bird.

248
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,041
Lark.

249
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,291
Cup of tea, Chief Inspector?

250
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,624
No, thank you.

251
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,999
Please be seated,
Chief Inspector.

252
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,374
You have come for my help,
I think.

253
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,833
Well, yes, you could say that.

254
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,874
Thing is, you see,
I've come to interview you.

255
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,624
Interview?

256
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,083
As a witness.

257
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,874
Witness to what?

258
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:16,083
You were at the Belgravia home
of Major John Rich last night?

259
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,499
Yes.

260
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,749
This morning,
I arrested Major Rich

261
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,166
for the murder
of Edward Clayton.

262
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,374
Mon Dieu.

263
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,083
You're saying
that I am a witness?

264
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,624
Did you, by any chance,

265
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,208
remark on an elaborate
wooden chest

266
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:37,791
in the room where you were,

267
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,416
a Spanish chest,
I believe it's called?

268
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,958
No, I don't think...

269
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,041
The manservant Burgoyne
discovered the body

270
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:48,083
inside this chest
when he was cleaning the room.

271
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,958
Clayton's blood had seeped
into the carpet.

272
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,291
He'd been stabbed
through the eye,

273
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,291
straight into the brain.

274
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,374
You're telling me that
the body was there while --

275
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,833
While the rest of you listened
to music and drank cocktails

276
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:10,333
and danced or whatever it is
you got up to, yes.

277
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:15,249
It's pretty macabre,
isn't it?

278
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,624
It's revolting.

279
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,374
Chief Inspector,
you are convinced

280
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,291
that the killer is Major Rich?

281
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
Rich was in love
with Marguerite Clayton.

282
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,708
That was the motive,

283
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,541
and he had the opportunity.

284
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,416
Clayton called round to see him

285
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,208
a few hours before
the first guests arrived.

286
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,333
You think that Major Rich,
he came home,

287
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,666
he killed Edward Clayton,
put the body in the chest,

288
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,291
and then, later, he entertained
his guests in the same room?

289
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,958
That's about the size of it.

290
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,999
No.

291
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:49,916
No, Chief Inspector.

292
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,791
And again, I say no.

293
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:53,833
It is not possible

294
00:23:55,667 --> 00:24:00,416
that Major Rich
killed Edward Clayton.

295
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,333
I swear to heaven, Mr. Poirot,
I never saw him.

296
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:26,458
Have you any idea

297
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,249
why Edward Clayton
should have wished to see you?

298
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,624
None at all.

299
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,374
According to Marguerite --
Mrs. Clayton --

300
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,583
he was on his way to Scotland.

301
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,874
Had you ever discussed
Mme. Clayton with her husband?

302
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,999
And why should I do that,
Mr. Poirot?

303
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,999
Forgive me, Major Rich, but...

304
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,624
how long ago is it
since your wife died?

305
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,041
I know what you're insinuating
Mr. Poirot,

306
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,416
but there was never anything
improper between us.

307
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,749
No.

308
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:24,833
Very good, sir.

309
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,499
Colonel Curtiss
will see you now, sir.

310
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,083
-Smithy!
-Sir.

311
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,666
Take these gentlemen through
to the strangers' room.

312
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,374
Yes, sir.
It's this way, gentlemen.

313
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,583
Thank you.

314
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,958
That's the, uh, gymnasium
through there.

315
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,624
There is a gymnasium here?

316
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:48,999
Oh, yes.

317
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,458
There's weights, fencing,
parallel bars.

318
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,333
It's very popular
with the members.

319
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,041
Um, so you thinking
of joining, then?

320
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,416
-No.
-Oh, right.

321
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,291
Um, we'll go this way.

322
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,041
And, uh, there's no talking.

323
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,624
Excuse me, Colonel Curtiss.
Your guests.

324
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,416
Thank you, Smithy.

325
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,208
-Colonel Curtiss.
-How do you do?

326
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,833
I'd like to introduce my
associate, Captain Hastings.

327
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,666
How do you do?
Please, sit down.

328
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,041
Thank you.

329
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,833
Well, I'm sure
you don't need to tell me

330
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,291
why you're here, Mr. Poirot.

331
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,708
It's a dreadful business.

332
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,083
Dreadful.

333
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,833
-Then you have heard?
-Yes.

334
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,124
Your chappie at Scotland Yard
seemed to find it amusing

335
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,583
that you were there last night.

336
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,374
And you?

337
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,874
I think it's a godsend.

338
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,958
I mean, you're a detective.

339
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,583
I am the detective,
Colonel Curtiss.

340
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,958
Then I don't need to tell you
that Major Rich, in my opinion,

341
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:58,458
could never...

342
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,083
May I ask you, Colonel Curtiss,

343
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,374
how did you come to know
Edward Clayton?

344
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,874
I knew Mrs. Clayton
before they married.

345
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,999
Was Mr. Clayton
a friend of yours?

346
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,124
Of course.

347
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,124
He was Marguerite's husband.

348
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,124
I understand that Edward Clayton
came to visit you

349
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,916
here at the club yesterday.

350
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,749
That's right.

351
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,416
What passed between you?

352
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:28,833
Oh, not much.

353
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:31,749
Had a drink together.

354
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,541
Told me he was going
to Scotland,

355
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,708
but that he'd look in at Rich's
on his way to the station.

356
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,083
Did he say why?

357
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,416
No.

358
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:46,749
To apologize for missing
the party, I imagine.

359
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,458
Had he ever hinted
at any impropriety

360
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:53,749
between Major Rich
and Marguerite Clayton?

361
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:57,749
Certainly not.

362
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:02,833
My apologies.

363
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,374
Colonel Curtiss,

364
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,999
I try only to establish
the facts.

365
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,083
Well, he wasn't much help,
was he?

366
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,041
Did you remark upon
his scar, Hastings?

367
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,083
Yes. You probably need one
to be a member here.

368
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,499
Marguerite,
you shouldn't have come.

369
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,833
I had to see you.

370
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,124
I don't know what to do, John.

371
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,166
There's nothing you can do.

372
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:59,583
Can't you leave us alone,
Officer?

373
00:29:03,334 --> 00:29:04,958
The police questioned me.

374
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,333
Margo...

375
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:09,666
I didn't kill him.

376
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,249
There's a private detective,
too, asking questions.

377
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,874
Just tell them the truth.

378
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,874
How can I?

379
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,083
I know it seems hard, Margo,

380
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,791
but if you just
tell the truth...

381
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,749
I'm sorry.

382
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,916
I can't stay here.

383
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,458
I'm sorry, John.

384
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,791
Marguerite.

385
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,166
I-I shouldn't have come here.

386
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,333
I left Mr. Clayton here

387
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,333
outside the sitting room door.

388
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:58,666
That must have been
just after 6:00.

389
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,749
I went to press
Major Rich's evening suit.

390
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,666
But Mr. Clayton didn't leave,
you say?

391
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,416
I think I would have heard him
if he'd gone.

392
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,166
Bien.
Tell me, M. Burgoyne,

393
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:10,666
when your master returned,

394
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,208
did you actually see him enter
at the door?

395
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,374
I heard the door close, sir.

396
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,083
But you did not see him enter?

397
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,874
No, sir.

398
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:20,333
Thank you.

399
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,833
If you please,
we will now go inside.

400
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,958
You think Major Rich
was waiting for Clayton?

401
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,749
It is possible, Hastings.

402
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,708
He kills Edward Clayton,

403
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,708
he puts the body inside
the chest, he comes out,

404
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,874
he shuts the door to establish
that he has just arrived.

405
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,416
Let us look
at this Spanish chest.

406
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,958
Alors.

407
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,624
It is not the same.

408
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,416
Ah, the carpet
has been taken up, sir.

409
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,166
You see, Hastings, this chest,

410
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:57,916
it is clearly visible
from the door, yes?

411
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,958
But...

412
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,458
Yes.

413
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:12,541
The screen conceals most of it
from the rest of the room.

414
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,999
If you please, Hastings.

415
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:48,041
What do you make of this,
Hastings?

416
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,374
Woodworm?

417
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,999
Come, Hastings.

418
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,874
There is nothing more
for us here.

419
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,124
Well, Major Rich certainly had
the opportunity to kill Clayton,

420
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,791
and as for motive, well...

421
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,583
Go on, mon ami.

422
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:18,916
Well, Mrs. Clayton.

423
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,999
It doesn't look too good
for him, does it?

424
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,708
You think not, Hastings?

425
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,166
I wonder what the beautiful
Mme. Clayton

426
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:26,708
has to say about all this.

427
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:30,249
Romaine Gardens, if you please.

428
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,458
Oh, quick, gentlemen,
please, please help me.

429
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,458
Something terrible
has happened.

430
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,749
She's locked herself
in there, sir.

431
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:54,083
I can't get no answer
when I knock.

432
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:04,124
Quick, mademoiselle,
telephone for the doctor.

433
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,624
I've washed out her stomach.

434
00:34:25,084 --> 00:34:26,333
She ought to rest.

435
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,166
We shall take one
or two minutes only, Doctor.

436
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,916
You do understand the urgency
of the situation?

437
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,291
Yes. No more than
five minutes, though.

438
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:36,791
Oui, d'accord.

439
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,083
Merci beaucoup.

440
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,499
It's my fault.

441
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,041
It was all my fault.

442
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:55,583
Major Rich and I,

443
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:02,041
we'd always been friends,
but that was all.

444
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:05,208
Until his wife died.

445
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,249
Oh.

446
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,124
It was all my fault,
Mr. Poirot.

447
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,791
What did you do?

448
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,958
I prayed
for my husband's death.

449
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,666
I wanted Edward to die.

450
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,583
Major Rich knew my feelings.

451
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:32,541
We talked about it.

452
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:35,708
But only...

453
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,041
he must have misunderstood me.

454
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,666
He must have thought I was
asking him to kill my husband.

455
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,999
That's why he did it.

456
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:49,708
Oh, God.

457
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,958
Oh, God.

458
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,374
This is difficult, Hastings.

459
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,208
Very difficult.

460
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:16,916
Le tarte aux fraises,
s'il vous plaît.

461
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,499
Just a cup of coffee
for me, please.

462
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:26,583
Merci.

463
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,749
To commit a crime, yes,

464
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,374
but then to invite 20 people
into the same room?

465
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,416
Major Rich has stabbed
Edward Clayton.

466
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:42,291
He has put the body into
the Spanish chest minutes before

467
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,374
a party is due to start.

468
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,291
Thank you.

469
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,333
But what about the valet,
Hastings, what of him?

470
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,708
He would be certain to discover
the body in the morning.

471
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,249
Now, Major Rich
would have known that.

472
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,791
So why did not the major

473
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:01,791
dispose of the body
during the night?

474
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,291
Hastings,

475
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,166
I must return to
the Scotland Yard

476
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,583
and the Chief Inspector Japp.

477
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,624
-Oh, I'll come with you.
-No, no, no, no.

478
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,291
You will take yourself
to the military club.

479
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,833
There is there,
I think, a gymnasium.

480
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,374
What's a gymnasium
got to do with it?

481
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,541
That is precisely what
you will find out for me.

482
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,999
Detecting's
not what it was, you know.

483
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,666
They expect you to be
a blooming secretary.

484
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,583
How do you make
this thing go backwards?

485
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:42,958
How do you mean?

486
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,083
I want to go back
and type over something.

487
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,958
There must be some sort of
reverse gear.

488
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,874
It isn't that one, is it?

489
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,541
See who that is.

490
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:03,708
Bonjour, Sergeant.

491
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,083
Mr. Poirot, sir.

492
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:06,499
Ah, come in, Poirot.

493
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:08,791
All right.

494
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,041
Take a seat.
I'll be with you --

495
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,666
Oh, damn and blast it!

496
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,249
All this paperwork.

497
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,124
You any good with one of these?

498
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,708
No, and my own Miss Lemon
is, alas...

499
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:29,208
-Not ill, is she?
-Worse.

500
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,791
She is at Frinton.

501
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38,916
Chief Inspector,

502
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,291
I need to see the contents of
the pockets of Edward Clayton

503
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,874
at the time that he was taken
from the chest.

504
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,041
It's very popular with
the members, the gymnasium.

505
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,166
And that's where it happened?

506
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,249
That's what I was told.

507
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,416
Before my time, though.

508
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,708
But there was a duel?

509
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,249
Yeah, at 6:00 in the morning.

510
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,208
I don't know who they were,
so you needn't bother to ask.

511
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,583
Why did they fight?

512
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:05,749
Why do you think -- it was over
some woman, wasn't it?

513
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,333
Marguerite Clayton.

514
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:08,708
I don't know who it was.

515
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,499
Now, about my 10 bob.

516
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,541
Mm.

517
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,041
These two men...

518
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,458
Was one of them having an affair
with Marguerite Clayton?

519
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,208
Now, that was
the barmy thing about it.

520
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,583
It was all just a joke.

521
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,666
One of the officers made
a joke about the lady,

522
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:28,416
so the other one called him out.

523
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,958
That's all it was, a joke.

524
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,083
Wasn't any sort of joke, though,

525
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:33,916
go and get yourself
sliced up like salami.

526
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,666
Yes, we wondered about that.

527
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,041
But I expected it.

528
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:00,749
Voilà!

529
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,291
Yes.

530
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,583
It's for you.
Hastings.

531
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:17,833
Hello?

532
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,374
Yes, Hastings?

533
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:21,916
Good.

534
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,708
But he did not tell you
the people involved?

535
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,416
Excellent, Hastings.

536
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,124
Excellent.

537
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,791
Well?

538
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,041
Chief Inspector Japp,
I must ask you to trust me

539
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,458
as you have never
trusted me before.

540
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,916
Here we go.

541
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,916
Yes, but we have never before
faced a crime that is perfect,

542
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,999
committed with such coldness.

543
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,541
It is remarkable, unique.

544
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,124
I don't know
why I bother sometimes.

545
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,291
I may as well stay at home
and do my garden.

546
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:03,416
Who do you want me
to arrest now?

547
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:15,083
Mrs. Clayton, this way!

548
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,916
Is it true you're still
investigating?

549
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:21,083
Is she under arrest, Inspector?

550
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:24,999
M. Poirot, how long have you
been involved in the case?

551
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,166
Did you arrange to have
Mrs. Clayton arrested?

552
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,958
I have nothing to say.

553
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,458
All right, Rich,
pack your kit.

554
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:36,958
You're going out.

555
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,083
Hello?

556
00:41:59,292 --> 00:42:01,166
You've got it wrong,
Mr. Poirot.

557
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,041
I know who killed
Edward Clayton.

558
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:06,541
You know who --

559
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:09,291
Meet me at the military club
in the gymnasium.

560
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,541
Who is this, please?

561
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,916
I'll show you.

562
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:17,833
Hello?

563
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,166
Colonel Curtiss.

564
00:43:44,084 --> 00:43:46,624
You've got it wrong,
you bloody little frog!

565
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,916
You've arrested
Marguerite Clayton.

566
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,499
You've degraded her,

567
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:58,458
soiled her!

568
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,166
But she had nothing
to do with it.

569
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,958
Two things, Colonel Curtiss.

570
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,291
Firstly, I am not
a bloody little frog.

571
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,749
I am a bloody little Belgian.

572
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,041
Secondly, I know quite well

573
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,624
that Marguerite Clayton
is innocent.

574
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,083
Go on.

575
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,958
Edward Clayton believed his wife
to be unfaithful.

576
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,874
There was talk,
but he was not certain,

577
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,208
so he came to you, his friend,

578
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,833
and you suggested
a scheme fantastique.

579
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,749
Will you listen to me?

580
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,083
Will you do as I say?

581
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,291
I just don't know if I can
go through with it, Curtiss.

582
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,749
M. Clayton was obsessed
with the possibility

583
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,583
that his wife
had been unfaithful,

584
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:51,458
and so you fueled his jealousy
for your own ends.

585
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,791
First, you tell him he must play
the old, old trick

586
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,666
of pretending to go away.

587
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:02,166
A business trip to Scotland
will do very nicely.

588
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,374
Then he gains admission
to the house of Major Rich

589
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,124
under the pretext
of leaving a note.

590
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,624
Then, following your scheme,

591
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,874
Edward Clayton conceals himself

592
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,916
inside the Spanish chest.

593
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,458
Now he can hear for himself
what takes place.

594
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,499
Perhaps he will hear Major Rich
make love to his wife,

595
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,749
but at least the torment
will be over.

596
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:41,958
He will know.

597
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,458
But there is one further
consideration.

598
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,458
To breathe inside the box,
he needs the air,

599
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,958
and so, with the instrument
he has brought,

600
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,499
he makes a hole through which
he can not only breathe,

601
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,291
but, most important of all,

602
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,541
through which he can observe.

603
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:07,791
But the poor, deluded Clayton.

604
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:10,166
He did not know that you also
were in love with Marguerite,

605
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:11,874
that you had always loved her,

606
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,416
fought even a duel for her.

607
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:17,833
Fertig?

608
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,208
Ready?

609
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:25,124
We are English, for God's sake!

610
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,624
Who told you that?

611
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:32,624
I was joking.

612
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,999
Your scar.

613
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,583
Aah!

614
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:43,749
Your first scheme
had been merely

615
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,416
to get rid of Edward Clayton,

616
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,791
but even with her husband
out of the way,

617
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,166
you began to fear

618
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:51,624
that she might eventually
turn to a younger man.

619
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:55,458
Major Rich.

620
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:00,708
This last scheme of yours
would encompass them both.

621
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,458
With one stroke,
Edward Clayton is dead,

622
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,666
and Major Rich will hang

623
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,458
for the murder.

624
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,416
Nobody knows I'm here.

625
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,374
When the police
find you tomorrow,

626
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:11,999
they'll know they were wrong
to release Rich.

627
00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:16,708
You still wish to fight
for Marguerite Clayton

628
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:21,041
after all these years?

629
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,749
But not with me, I think.

630
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,874
Will you fight for her,
Colonel?

631
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,833
Damn you!

632
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,833
Los!

633
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,291
Aah!

634
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:21,083
I'm forever in your debt,
Mr. Poirot.

635
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,249
Eh bien, madame,
it was nothing.

636
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,999
My husband was not
a likeable man, but...

637
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,916
to be murdered in cold blood.

638
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,416
I don't see why you had
Mrs. Clayton arrested.

639
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:37,458
Major Rich, it was necessary

640
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:39,499
to smoke out
the Colonel Curtiss,

641
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,916
you understand?

642
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,708
And to make a public spectacle

643
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,083
of Mme. Clayton.

644
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,999
It was the only way.

645
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,291
You were wonderful.

646
00:50:52,084 --> 00:50:53,791
Well, as they say, madame...

647
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:57,666
it was nothing.

648
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,499
I was... lucky,

649
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,624
that is all.

650
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:06,291
We'll always be grateful
to you, Mr. Poirot.

651
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:07,666
Thank you.

652
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,249
Always.

653
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,624
Madame.

654
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:13,874
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

655
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,874
Nothing?

656
00:51:30,084 --> 00:51:31,333
Lucky?

657
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,624
I am learning, Hastings.

658
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:36,291
It is more English, yes,
the humbleness?

659
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,458
Well, I am learning.

660
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:40,541
I shall be

661
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:43,666
the most humble person
in the world.

662
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:46,624
No one shall match
Hercule Poirot

663
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:48,666
for his "humbility."
