1
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,666
News, please.

2
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:57,999
Sorry about this, Poirot.

3
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,916
I thought, as she was here
visiting with her sister,

4
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:03,583
it'd be a simple matter for her
to meet us at the station.

5
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:04,833
Hold tight, please.

6
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,249
The trouble with Mrs. Japp is,

7
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,291
once she gets nattering
over a cup of tea,

8
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,958
she loses all track of time.

9
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,958
Perhaps you two better run along
and we'll see you there.

10
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,541
Oh, no, we wouldn't dream --

11
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,791
Yes, Chief Inspector, that is
a suggestion most sensible.

12
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,583
Come, Hastings.
We look for a taxi.

13
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,416
Ah, you know what he's like

14
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,583
when he hasn't had a case
for a few weeks.

15
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,833
I thought a nice afternoon
at a garden fete

16
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,874
might cheer him up a bit.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,249
Taxi!

18
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:32,958
Mm.

19
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,291
About the only thing
that's gonna cheer him up today

20
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,416
is the discovery of a body
in the lucky dip.

21
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:38,833
Ha!

22
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,333
Stomach still giving you gyp?

23
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,708
That crab mayonnaise sandwich
I had for lunch, like as not.

24
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:46,583
Taxi!

25
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,416
Be a fine way
to spend my afternoon off

26
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,291
if I end up
contracting food poisoning.

27
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,624
Hastings!

28
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,958
You go on, Captain Hastings,
and we'll see you both later.

29
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,083
Marble Hill Park,
if you please, driver.

30
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,874
-I say. Isn't that --
-Hastings.

31
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,166
That fashion model?

32
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,874
The girl driving the car.

33
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm sure I've seen her
before somewhere.

34
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,041
On a magazine cover.

35
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,124
-Anyone at home?
-Darling!

36
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,124
Mmm! Careful.
You'll mess up my clothes.

37
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,083
What do you think?

38
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,416
I think
I'm a very, very lucky chap.

39
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,624
Come on. Let's get inside
before we're stung to death.

40
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,958
You know, there are wasps
all over the place.

41
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:43,333
Oh, who was that man?

42
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,291
-Man?
-Rather odd-looking.

43
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,874
He was just leaving
as I arrived.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,041
Drove off
in a rather wonderful black car.

45
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,124
Sorry. No one called 'round
that I'm aware of.

46
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,166
Only you.

47
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,749
How's your car, by the way?

48
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,708
Remind me to check
those brakes of yours.

49
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,541
You said they were feeling
very spongy.

50
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,833
Boys and girls, this cactus

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,916
has not had a flower
for 200 years.

52
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,583
200 years without a flower.
What can I do?

53
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,958
-Keep watering!
-Keep watering!

54
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,666
Of course!
Keep watering!

55
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,124
Ooh!

56
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,083
Ah, Chief Inspector.

57
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,916
Mme. Japp, she's still
not with you?

58
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,208
Her sister's got flu,

59
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,249
and she doesn't want to
spread the germs.

60
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,791
Ah, the old fortune teller.

61
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,458
You gonna have a tanner's worth?

62
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,833
I think not, mon ami.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,124
Although it is a subject
most intriguing for the study.

64
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,999
There she is again.
It is her.

65
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,791
Molly, um...
What's her name?

66
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,958
Deane!
The fashion model.

67
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,166
I wish I'd brought the 150
with me now.

68
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,791
The new toy.

69
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,124
I give it two,
perhaps three weeks.

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,499
Oh.

71
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,874
I missed her.

72
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,583
She's gone.

73
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,291
How much are these?

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,749
What?
What are you playing at?

75
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:13,749
Molly.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,666
Claude, will you get away --

77
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:26,124
Oh, darling.
Why, I thought you'd got lost.

78
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,208
Look who I just ran into.

79
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,624
Is that you under there, Claude?

80
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,958
Didn't tell me you were
going into politics.

81
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,041
You know, you're just the man
I wanted to see.

82
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,749
You know that nest of wasps you
cleared out for me last summer?

83
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,874
They're back again.
With a vengeance this time.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,124
Thousands of the blighters.

85
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,124
Driving me absolutely potty
in that garden.

86
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,791
Oh, right you are.
I'll see what I can do.

87
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,708
All right if I pop 'round
Friday morning?

88
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,833
Fine.

89
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,458
Better get back
to your next show.

90
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,499
I think the audience
is getting restless.

91
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,666
Now, who wants to go
to a dentist?!

92
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,583
Let's have some tea.

93
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,999
-Thank you.
-Yes. Bye.

94
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,333
He hasn't been bothering you,
has he?

95
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,874
Claude Langton?

96
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,833
Of course not.

97
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,249
-Two teas, please.
-Certainly.

98
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,458
All he wants now is for
the two of us to be happy.

99
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,958
Honestly.
What's past is past.

100
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,416
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,499
Enjoy your tea.

102
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,041
Well, I'll be jiggered.

103
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,749
What is it?

104
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,083
I'd know that egghead anywhere.

105
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,458
I see also arising

106
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,833
the problems where the matters
of health are concerned.

107
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,999
You're right.

108
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,374
I've had these pains
in my stomach all day long.

109
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,416
-Been absolute murder.
-Did someone say "murder"?

110
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,541
M. Poirot, how are you?
As well as ever, I hope.

111
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,583
Mon Dieu!
C'est M. John Harrison!

112
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,999
What an unexpected pleasure.

113
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,541
It seems an absolute age
since we last met.

114
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,749
I suppose it must have been
at Father's funeral.

115
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,624
Ah.

116
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,624
Forgive me.
This is my fiancée, Molly.

117
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,124
Molly, may I introduce
M. Hercule Poirot,

118
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,416
the famous detective?

119
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,624
-Oh!
-How do you do?

120
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,374
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

121
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,749
Ah, Hastings,
the father of M. Harrison

122
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,208
was my first and dearest friend
in this country.

123
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,749
M. Harrison is himself

124
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,666
the writer of some repute,
n'est-ce pas?

125
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,749
No, no, no, no, no.

126
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,291
You've had published now,
combien, three books?

127
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,499
Oh, really?
What were they called?

128
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,541
I might have read one.

129
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,416
Well, let's see.

130
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,541
The first
was "Dualism and Determinism --

131
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,041
an Exploration of
Classical Platonic Philosophy."

132
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,083
Then there was "Aristotelian
Ethics -- A Short Guide

133
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,083
to the Metaphysical Works
of Aristotle."

134
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,208
Oh, M. Poirot,
you read tea leaves.

135
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,749
-Oui.
-How exciting!

136
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,416
-But you must read mine, please.
-Oh, bien sûr!

137
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,166
Allow me.

138
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,083
Merci.
Please to sit.

139
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,541
Ah.

140
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,166
Voilà.

141
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,499
Excuse the lipstick.

142
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,874
Ah.

143
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,541
Merci.

144
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,666
Mademoiselle, only you
have drunk from this cup?

145
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,041
Yes.

146
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,708
What is it?
What do you see?

147
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,833
Of course, I may be quite wrong.

148
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,291
I hope that I am.

149
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,249
But I see looming
the dark clouds.

150
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,624
And, ah, The troubled waters.

151
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,916
Mademoiselle,
I see the times ahead

152
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,416
most dangerous for you both.

153
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,583
Aaaah!

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,749
I think...

155
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,249
Better call a doctor.

156
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,291
Shall we do it again?!

157
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,666
Yeah!

158
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,666
You're in
the safe hands now, mon ami.

159
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,458
What time is the operation?

160
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,791
They said about 6:00.

161
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,208
About 6:00.

162
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:23,999
Well, I hope it's not too much
of an ordeal, old chap.

163
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,458
When I had mine out,
it was absolute hell.

164
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,708
For a week afterwards,

165
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,374
I got this stabbing pain
all down my right-hand side.

166
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,833
Hastings, Hastings.

167
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,749
I think the chief inspector
would like now

168
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,958
the little rest, huh?

169
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,124
Oh.

170
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,166
So the prediction of Poirot,
it becomes true, n'est-ce pas?

171
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,208
Oh, come on.

172
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:53,916
All that fortune-telling stuff's
baloney, and you know it.

173
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,541
You think so, Hastings?

174
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,833
You did see something

175
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,791
in Molly Deane's cup, though,
didn't you?

176
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,416
But it wasn't tea leaves.

177
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,791
Hastings, I wonder
if you can recall

178
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,041
what was the color of lipstick

179
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,499
Mlle. Deane was wearing
this afternoon.

180
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,791
Rather pale pink, I think.
It matched her scarf.

181
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,166
D'accord.

182
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,916
But when I examined closely
the teacup,

183
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,624
I see not only the traces
of the pink lipstick,

184
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,958
but that also of another color.

185
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,083
The deep, bright red.

186
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,249
Have a nice lunch
with M. Poirot, won't you?

187
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,958
And do give him my apologies.

188
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,374
No luck with the petrol,
I'm afraid.

189
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:00,749
They're hardy little devils.

190
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,583
I'll have to try them
with something stronger.

191
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,374
Maybe I'll pop back
and give it another go.

192
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,416
Wednesday evening?

193
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,541
Uh, Wednesday.
Yes, fine.

194
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,541
Just off, Molly. You couldn't be
an angel and drop --

195
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,208
Uh, no, Claude.
I'm not going that way today.

196
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,166
Sorry.

197
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:18,541
See you tonight, darling.

198
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,874
For goodness' sake,
drive carefully.

199
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,166
So it's all right

200
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,541
if I take an early lunch,
then, Mr. Poirot?

201
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,624
We're working on toning up

202
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,374
the calf
and thigh muscles today.

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,791
Oh, yes, Miss Lemon!

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,874
Under no circumstances
must you be late

205
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
for your keep-fit lesson!

206
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,208
Sacré!

207
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:52,874
You know, it wouldn't
do you any harm

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,041
to try one or two exercises,
Mr. Poirot.

209
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,083
Oh, thanks, Poirot.

210
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,166
"Use your vigor
to keep your figure"?

211
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
Absurd!

212
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,291
There's nothing wrong
with the body of Poirot.

213
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,916
It is in the peak of condition.

214
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,708
Now, have I got everything?

215
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,916
Developer, fixer,
glazing solution, stopwatch.

216
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,458
Right.

217
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,124
You're not planning to use
the bathroom

218
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,833
for the next half-hour or so,
are you, Poirot?

219
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:32,749
Well, just let me check
with my diary, Hastings.

220
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,208
No, it would seem not!

221
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,958
Good. If you need me,
you know where I am.

222
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,291
-Cup of tea, Margaret?
-Oh, that would be lovely.

223
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,874
I'll see you on Wednesday, then.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,458
Right.

225
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,041
Taxi!

226
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,124
Whitehaven Mansions, please,
driver.

227
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,166
-Oh!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just...

228
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,791
No, no.
It's all right.

229
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,666
Did I hear you say
Whitehaven Mansions?

230
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,041
That's correct.

231
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,041
-Well, shall we share?
-Yes, yes. By all means.

232
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,749
My name's John Harrison.

233
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,749
I got some interesting
tonal variations there

234
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,374
by using a low-contrast paper.

235
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,124
Oh, this is not good, Hastings.

236
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,166
No, this is not good at all.

237
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,291
Bit overexposed, do you think?

238
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,083
Maybe I should have stopped down
to f/16.

239
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,708
No, no, no, no, no.
Poirot.

240
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,999
Always you put the
interpretations most sinister

241
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,874
on matters which may be
quite innocent.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,958
Sorry?

243
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,624
Mr. Poirot, what do you think?

244
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,458
We found ourselves running
for the same taxi.

245
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:06,666
-M. Harrison, bonjour.
-Bonjour.

246
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,291
Mlle. Deane,
she is not with you.

247
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,041
I know.
She's frightfully sorry.

248
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,999
This job interview came up
at the last minute.

249
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,416
Some out-of-the-way hotel
up North.

250
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,333
She had to dash straight there.

251
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,833
Ah, no, no, no, no.

252
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,374
I invite you.
This is my treat.

253
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,666
In that case,
you must come and have tea.

254
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,833
Both of you.
Next week.

255
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,624
This time of year,
it's an absolute --

256
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,708
Mr. Harrison.
Telephone call for you.

257
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,124
I think there's been
an accident.

258
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,833
It's all right, darling.
I'm fine.

259
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:06,666
Well, I'm still a bit shaky,
but...

260
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,874
No, I...

261
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,833
I don't know what happened.

262
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,708
The brakes just suddenly --

263
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,374
I know.

264
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,166
Look, they say
it's going to take till Monday

265
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,041
to get the car back on the road,
so, uh...

266
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,499
Well, I suppose I'll just
have to stay here till then.

267
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,749
Yes.

268
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,124
Yes, of course.

269
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:31,291
Yes, that's fine, darling.

270
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,583
Bye.

271
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,708
Mlle. Deane, she is all right?

272
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,374
Yes, thank God.

273
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,083
Yes, she's fine.

274
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:59,124
Bit of a bind, being stuck up
there in that hotel all weekend.

275
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,041
Still, you weren't hurt.
That's the main thing.

276
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,333
Just a few scratches
under my right knee.

277
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,958
Good thing hemlines are low
this year.

278
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,666
Yes, quite.

279
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,958
Come on.
Let's have some tea.

280
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,333
Mind how you go
down the bottom there, Poirot.

281
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,916
That's wasp country.

282
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:23,124
Nasty great nests of them
just by that old tree.

283
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,749
I've already been stung
three times.

284
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,624
What did you say, mon ami?

285
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,249
-I said mind how you --
-Aah!

286
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,624
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

287
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,291
Oh!
Oh, mon Dieu!

288
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:32,999
Oh! Oh!

289
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,416
I say, Poirot,
are you all right?

290
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,249
-Let's have a look.
-Aah!

291
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,874
The open air, it should
be closed during the summer.

292
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,999
Captain Hastings, he wonders
why I have a hatred

293
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,916
for these
crawling, buzzing things.

294
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,791
And the reason is, they're
always trying to kill me.

295
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,874
I had old Claude
'round here last week.

296
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,083
Tried to take it out for me,
but no dice.

297
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,958
He's coming back to have
another go Wednesday evening.

298
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,666
-Claude?
-Langton.

299
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,791
Sorry, I thought you met him
at the fete.

300
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,708
-No.
-Chap in the clown outfit.

301
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,333
Ah.

302
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,916
Sculptor. He has a studio
not far from here.

303
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,666
He and Molly were engaged
to be married.

304
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,791
About a year ago now.

305
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,583
But then, well,
one of those things.

306
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,541
They drifted apart.
We drifted closer together.

307
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,041
Great thing is, there's
absolutely no hard feelings.

308
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,833
Makes you realize
how lucky you are, I suppose.

309
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,958
Well, then. Teaspoons.

310
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,083
Here we are.

311
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:30,708
Thank you.

312
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:31,874
It's tomorrow evening.

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,416
7:30 for eight
at the Porchester.

314
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,124
Do come along.
I'm sure you'll have a ball.

315
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,208
Oh, yes. Rather.

316
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,833
I've never been
to a fashion show before.

317
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,833
-Sounds like great fun.
-Yes, indeed.

318
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,208
And thank you both

319
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,624
for an afternoon
that has been most enjoyable.

320
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,416
You know, you really should
pop into a chemist's

321
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,458
for that wasp sting.

322
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,499
Yes, you should.
Mrs. Henderson.

323
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,208
It just down the towpath
near the pub.

324
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,041
She'll have some cream
or something.

325
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,333
Ease the soreness a bit.

326
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:55,874
Ah, oui.
The chemist.

327
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,749
Mais certainement.

328
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,249
We will call in on our way.
Au revoir.

329
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,624
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

330
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,333
You know, I wish
that I could stop worrying.

331
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,999
But the questions, they keep
buzzing around my head

332
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,749
like the wasps
around the nest.

333
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,416
-Questions?
-Ask yourself, Hastings.

334
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,458
The brakes of Mlle. Deane --

335
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,541
Why do they suddenly fail her

336
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,916
only a few hours after
they had been examined

337
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,333
by M. John Harrison?

338
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,416
And M. Claude Langton --

339
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,708
Why was he unable to destroy
the nest of the wasps

340
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,416
in the garden of M. Harrison?

341
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,583
And of most significance,
Hastings,

342
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,166
who put the petrol
in the water butt and why?

343
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,249
Petrol in the water butt?

344
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,083
Sorry, Poirot, I'm afraid I fail
to get the drift of all this.

345
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,124
No, Hastings?

346
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,874
Why do you suppose
M. Claude Langton,

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,041
he forces his attentions
upon the Mlle. Deane

348
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,208
with so much passion
at the garden fete?

349
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,499
How on earth
do you work that out?

350
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,958
The kiss, Hastings.

351
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,541
The bright-red makeup
of the clown face

352
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,249
that was still upon her lips.

353
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,124
Oh, I see.
The cup.

354
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,541
Yes, I'd forgotten about that.

355
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,249
I say!
The poor girl.

356
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,666
-So you think --
-Hastings.

357
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,374
The chemist's.

358
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,874
Oh.

359
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:23,333
Good afternoon.

360
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,833
We were told to ask
for Mme. Henderson.

361
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,291
I'm Mrs. Henderson.

362
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,083
Ah.
And I am Hercule Poirot.

363
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:31,333
I know.

364
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,416
What can I do for you?

365
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,999
I have the misfortune
to be stung by the wasp

366
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,541
in the garden
of M. John Harrison.

367
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,708
It is on my neck,

368
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,624
and I am afraid it is becoming
quite sore.

369
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,333
I'll get you some
colorless iodine to put on it.

370
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,958
If you wouldn't mind
waiting a second.

371
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:48,333
Pas du tout.

372
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,458
Go through and talk to her.

373
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,541
-Hastings.
-Hmm?

374
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,999
Talk to her.

375
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,624
-What about?
-Anything.

376
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:09,791
You, uh, run this place
all on your own, do you?

377
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,833
Well, since my husband died.

378
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,249
A couple of years ago.

379
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,874
Not much to run, really.

380
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,999
Nice, uh...
N-Nice chap, John Harrison.

381
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,208
-Do you know him at all?
-Yes.

382
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:26,583
He gave me a copy
of one of his books.

383
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:29,541
"Aristotelian Ethics."

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,666
I found it very perceptive.

385
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,666
-Have you read that one?
-Ah, not yet, no.

386
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,708
He's getting married
to that fashion model,

387
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,791
Molly Deane, I gather.

388
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,624
Funny match.

389
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,458
It's like Albert Einstein
and Ginger Rogers.

390
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,499
-That's love, I suppose.
-Yes.

391
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,291
Well, they, um...

392
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,083
Did you want something else?

393
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,791
Uh...

394
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,249
Oh, sorry.
No. Forgive me.

395
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,916
Here we are, then.

396
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,291
It's very good,
but use it sparingly.

397
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,166
Oui.

398
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,333
That's ninepence, please.

399
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,249
En passant, madame,

400
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,708
you would not know perhaps

401
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,083
where we might find
a M. Claude Langton?

402
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,666
Oh, yes.

403
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,708
He's one of the more avant-garde
artists who live around here.

404
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:25,291
You'll find him in the new house
'round the corner.

405
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,541
The one with the zigzags
on the front door.

406
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,916
You can't miss it.

407
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,708
Merci beaucoup, madame.
You have been most helpful.

408
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,458
Au revoir.
Hastings.

409
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,333
Private detectives, you say?

410
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,791
So, what you doing 'round here?

411
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,458
Investigating a crime
of some sort?

412
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:07,833
Well, perhaps.

413
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,958
Serious crime?

414
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:13,124
A crime of the most serious
there is, monsieur.

415
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,458
-You mean...
-Murder.

416
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,749
But I haven't heard anything
about a murder.

417
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,791
No.
You would not have heard of it.

418
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,374
Because, as yet,
it has not taken place.

419
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,583
You see, if one can investigate
a murder before it happens,

420
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,041
then one might even --

421
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,083
well, a little idea --

422
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,374
prevent it?

423
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,708
I don't quite see
what this has to do with me.

424
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,124
Mm.

425
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,541
Mlle. Molly Deane.

426
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,874
You and she were once engaged
to be married, n'est-ce pas?

427
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,666
Look, that was over a year ago.
Water under the bridge.

428
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,708
We're nothing more
than good friends now.

429
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,291
Indeed, M. Langton?

430
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,666
Absolutely stunning outfit.

431
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,416
So I still keep some of
her old photos about the place.

432
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,333
That doesn't mean I still...

433
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,208
All right.
What do you want me to say?

434
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,999
I still love her, all right?

435
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,166
Desperately.

436
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,208
But I'm nothing to her anymore.

437
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,124
That's just something
I'm going to have to live with.

438
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,458
It won't be easy.
it'll be damned hard.

439
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,458
But murder?

440
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,291
Oh, no, Mr. Poirot.

441
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:30,624
I'm afraid you've got it
all wrong this time.

442
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,833
You see, Johnny's the best
friend I've got in the world.

443
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,249
I couldn't harm him.

444
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,666
I just couldn't.

445
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,499
If you ask me,
all this fortune-telling

446
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,874
is going to his head.

447
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:53,999
He's talking about investigating
a murder now

448
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,999
that hasn't even happened yet.

449
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,999
Making a mountain out of
a molehill, if you ask me.

450
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,166
Ah! Sapristi!

451
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,083
I cannot enter
even my own bathroom

452
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,416
without walking into
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

453
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,791
Oh, sorry.
They're probably dry by now.

454
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,833
And I am not making the hills
out of the mole mounts.

455
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:18,583
No, no, Hastings.

456
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,208
No, this time, the evidence,
it is too strong.

457
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,583
What evidence?

458
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,708
On the top shelf in the studio
of M. Claude Langton --

459
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,416
You did not see it,
but I knew it would be there.

460
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:32,708
I knew it would be there

461
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,083
because I saw the record of its
purchase at the chemist's shop.

462
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:37,666
-Excuse me.
-Knew what would be there?

463
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,624
The poison, Hastings.

464
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,749
The cyanide of the potassium.

465
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,583
A little stronger
than the petrol

466
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,999
for the killing of the wasps,
huh?

467
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,749
All in a single stroke,
1,000 deaths.

468
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,083
And then perhaps,
so easily, 1,001 .

469
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:02,291
Combining enormous charm
and distinction,

470
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:05,791
in fabric as well in line --
The Merry Widow,

471
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,333
a delightful design

472
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,666
beautifully molded
in black crepe

473
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:14,499
with clever white beading
on the sleeves.

474
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,124
The cape of self-frilled
black chiffon

475
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,124
simply floats around you
as you walk.

476
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:24,208
Softly feminine
with a touch of elegance.

477
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:36,541
An irresistible choice for
those late-summer evenings --

478
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:40,249
La Bohème, an outfit in
shot-pink-and-gold sari silk.

479
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,708
And Prelude -- skillfully
contoured in gold sequined lace

480
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,208
over ivory silk.

481
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,416
A revelation this season --

482
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,791
Mermaid,
a breathtaking bias-cut dress

483
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:02,749
divinely sculpted from
green-and-silver velvet lamé

484
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,374
with a deep-back décolletage
that is utterly sublime.

485
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,041
The pale-aquamarine satin cowl

486
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,541
is attached at the shoulders
in floating panels

487
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,624
and the shoulders
held by diamonte clips.

488
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:20,916
A creation that is already
conquering the United States

489
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,208
from New York to Hollywood.

490
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,083
So discreet yet so grand
is Gloriana,

491
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,958
fusing the classical grace
of a gold satin sheath dress...

492
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,874
Hastings, we must go backstage.

493
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,166
-Sorry?
-Immediatement.

494
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,374
Notice the sheer
perfection of line

495
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,374
and the rhythm of movement.

496
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:59,249
Weekend teams a radiant gown
of pearl-white crepe...

497
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,249
Excuse me. Pardon.

498
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,291
S'il vous plaît.

499
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,416
We look for Mlle. Molly Deane.

500
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,374
Oh, she's finished.

501
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,624
I think she went off
with some gentleman.

502
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,124
Merci beau--

503
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,666
Mademoiselle, that dress.

504
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,833
Sorry. Can't stop.

505
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,083
Come, Hastings.

506
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,041
Quick, Hastings!
Your camera!

507
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,791
Oh!

508
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,666
How is it now?

509
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,791
Head still pounding?

510
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,708
Delayed effect
from that crash maybe.

511
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:44,624
Well, I'll -- I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

512
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:54,791
Nope.

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,458
Can't say
he means a thing to me.

514
00:32:56,584 --> 00:33:00,416
No one from our rogues' gallery,
or I'd recognize him.

515
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,208
What's this all about anyway?

516
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,666
Something going on
I ought to know about?

517
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,541
No.

518
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,624
Nothing that you should be

519
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,666
concerning yourself with,
Chief Inspector.

520
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:12,208
Especially in
your present condition.

521
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,833
You are feeling better now, yes?

522
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,374
No.
I feel worse.

523
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,083
Talk about
going to hell and back.

524
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,041
I don't reckon
they put me to sleep properly.

525
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,874
I swear I felt every incision
that surgeon made

526
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,541
when he was cutting into my --

527
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,458
Hastings, I really think
we ought to be going now.

528
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,083
Mme. Japp,
she's coming to collect you

529
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,458
later on this morning, yes?

530
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:37,874
-Half past 11:00.
-Bon.

531
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,124
Well, we look forward

532
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,666
to seeing you up and about again
very soon.

533
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,833
Au revoir.

534
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,749
Thanks for the chocolates!

535
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,833
It is no use, Hastings.

536
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,583
It will not go away.

537
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,541
Everything has happened,
and yet nothing has happened.

538
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,666
Certainement, this is the most
difficult moment of my career.

539
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,999
To solve the crime
that does not exist.

540
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,958
Right.
I'm just off again, then.

541
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,708
Sure you won't come along,
Mr. Poirot?

542
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,999
Might ease
a bit of that tension.

543
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,124
No.

544
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,499
Well, if you change your mind,
it's 35 Devonshire Street.

545
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,249
They have three classes daily.

546
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,333
Fully comprehensive
physical-fitness program

547
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,958
exercising the whole body.

548
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,083
Not just the thumbs.

549
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,666
I'm terribly sorry.

550
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,958
Are you all right?

551
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,083
And you are quite certain

552
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:23,666
that this is the same man,
Chief Inspector?

553
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,083
Yes.

554
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,666
Well, thank you very much
for telephoning.

555
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,999
Right. Au revoir.

556
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,583
At the hospital.

557
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:46,124
Devonshire Street.

558
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,291
32 -- 15A.

559
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,583
32...

560
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,624
Ah!

561
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,958
The pieces,
they begin to connect.

562
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,208
Enfin!

563
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:17,791
Where are you off to now?

564
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,583
To find out if I am right
or wrong, Hastings.

565
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,333
Oh, I suppose that leaves me
with nothing to do, then.

566
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,041
Unfortunately, oui.

567
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,791
Oh, no, no, Hastings.

568
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,124
You can buy for me
some washing soda.

569
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:36,624
Washing soda?

570
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,124
Poirot.

571
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,541
What a pleasant surprise.

572
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:11,916
Bonjour, M. Harrison.

573
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,916
Mlle. Molly Deane, she is
not with you this afternoon?

574
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,499
Molly? She's inside.

575
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,749
-Got a migraine or something.
-Ah.

576
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,999
Seems to have come on
after the show last night.

577
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,541
I expect she'll be fine.

578
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,416
And M. Claude Langton?

579
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:31,291
At what time is he due to arrive
to destroy your nest of wasps?

580
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,208
7:30, he said.

581
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,374
I imagine he'll be on time.

582
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:37,833
On time?

583
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,083
The man whose dearest love
you stole away with?

584
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:44,749
He comes here tonight
to the home of his rival

585
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,083
armed with a deadly poison.

586
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,708
Just what are you suggesting?

587
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:54,124
That Claude Langton might try --
Good God, this is England.

588
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,874
Jealous suitors don't go around
murdering people.

589
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,124
Besides, Claude Langton
wouldn't hurt a fly.

590
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,291
No?

591
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:05,458
Yet even now
he prepares to take the lives

592
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,416
of several thousand wasps.

593
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,208
There by the root of the tree.

594
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,708
The wasps returning home,
placid at the end of the day.

595
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,291
In one hour and a half

596
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:19,749
there will be
the total destruction,

597
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,958
and they know it not.

598
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:26,666
For the wasps, there is
no Hercule Poirot to warn them.

599
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:33,333
Eh bien.
The sun, it is still warm.

600
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,291
The evening, it is most pleasant

601
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,958
for taking a stroll
by the river.

602
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,208
You would not object
if I come back later

603
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:41,333
to watch this
destruction of the wasps?

604
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:43,333
Well, no. Of course.
Be my guest.

605
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,416
I return at 7:30.

606
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,041
Mlle. Deane
and M. Claude Langton,

607
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,416
they are both gone, yes?

608
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,791
Yes.

609
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,666
Yes, they've both gone.

610
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,124
And how are you feeling now,
monsieur?

611
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,499
Me?

612
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:43,958
Fine.

613
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,916
Why shouldn't I be?
What are you driving at?

614
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,083
No, no, no.
Non.

615
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,374
I see you have had some tea,
n'est-ce pas?

616
00:41:55,959 --> 00:42:00,916
You remember the garden fete
when I look into the future?

617
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,666
You will permit
if we do the same?

618
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,999
Please?

619
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,541
Turn it around.

620
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,416
No, no, no, no!
No.

621
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,124
Because this time,
it is different, eh?

622
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,916
This time we look backwards,
yes?

623
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,541
Into the past.

624
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,916
Because the past, it is clear
as crystal, n'est-ce pas?

625
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:39,124
As clear as the crystals
of cyanide poison

626
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:40,916
that are in this cup.

627
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,624
Oh, no, no, no, no, monsieur.
This does not shock you.

628
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,208
For it is you
who put them there.

629
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:52,124
It is no use, mon ami.
I know everything.

630
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,416
I know, just as you knew,
that a love affair

631
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,374
between Mlle. Deane
and M. Claude Langton

632
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,291
is far from being over,
as they claimed.

633
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,416
And during the past few weeks,

634
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,624
your fiancée, she has been
drifting back to her old love.

635
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,999
Is that not so?

636
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:10,333
In public,
she pretends to reject him.

637
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,708
Molly.

638
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:16,166
But in private, the old flames
are being rekindled.

639
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:19,666
Of course,
there is nothing wrong

640
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:21,249
with the brakes of her car.

641
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,999
You have already checked them.

642
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,374
No.

643
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:29,791
Quite deliberately, Mlle. Deane,
she drives the car into the tree

644
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:32,416
in order to spend
two days away from you.

645
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,416
Two days which she will spend
in the company

646
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,916
of M. Claude Langton.

647
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:40,041
Because she knows
it will break your heart,

648
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,833
she cannot bring herself to
reveal to you her secret affair.

649
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:47,499
But the signs are there
for those who will see.

650
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,833
In the house
of M. Claude Langton,

651
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,999
there is a photograph
of his former sweetheart.

652
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,666
He tells to me that this
photograph, it is an old one,

653
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,041
and that she now no longer
cares for him.

654
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,458
But he lies.

655
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,041
It has to be recently taken.

656
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,041
Because in the photograph she is
wearing the fashion moderne,

657
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:13,124
which a few months ago would not
even have been designed.

658
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,583
The camera, it never lies, yes?

659
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,916
And when I see your face
in a moment unguarded,

660
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,708
I see in it a deep, deep hatred.

661
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,291
I have seen that look before,
my friend.

662
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,666
I know to what lengths
it can drive a man.

663
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,499
This evening, you tell me
that M. Claude Langton,

664
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,083
he is due to arrive at 7:30.

665
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,874
But that is not true.

666
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:39,166
No.

667
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,416
He was coming earlier than that.

668
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:44,874
At 7:00.

669
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,499
Right, let's have
another go at this, shall we?

670
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,874
If this doesn't do the trick,
nothing will.

671
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,708
He arrived on time.

672
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:57,583
Set about his work straightaway.

673
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:04,374
While he wasn't looking,
it was... as you said.

674
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:08,708
I slipped some cyanide
into the cup.

675
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:15,541
Oh, God, what have I done?

676
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,208
Mon ami, I have told you
that I know everything.

677
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,291
I also know
that you are a sick man...

678
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,458
...and that you have been
visiting a doctor

679
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:36,083
in Devonshire Street.

680
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:39,458
The surgeon Mr. Belvedere.

681
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,458
You have just come from
his surgery on Friday morning

682
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:52,916
when you meet my secretary,
Miss Lemon, just down the road.

683
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,083
This afternoon I also made
a visit to the same doctor.

684
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,874
Well, he is
not difficult to find.

685
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:10,083
I have in my pocket
his photograph.

686
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:16,249
He tells to me that you have
the two months to live.

687
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,499
Is that not so?

688
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:28,374
He said
by October it could all...

689
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:33,041
Of course, he's breaking the
confidentiality of his client.

690
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,874
But he thought it would be
in your own interests

691
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,999
if he was to meet with
Mlle. Deane at the fashion show

692
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,583
and break to her
the tragic news.

693
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,749
That's...

694
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:48,541
...why she was in such a state
when she came here.

695
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:52,041
But it was
only when Claude arrived

696
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:54,249
that she told me
and that she knew.

697
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:58,666
Claude!

698
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,124
Oh, God!

699
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:05,291
Molly, what is it?

700
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,541
I'm sorry, John.

701
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:12,083
You see, I know.
Dr. Belvedere.

702
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,999
Last night
he told me everything.

703
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,208
I see.

704
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,708
John, I'm so, so sorry.

705
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:23,666
You're not sorry.

706
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:26,499
You're not sorry at all.
Either of you.

707
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:28,666
Get out.

708
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,166
Out of here and out of my life.
What's left of it.

709
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,291
Go on, Langton, take her.

710
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,124
It's what you've always wanted.

711
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,833
What you always planned.

712
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,583
Well, take her and get out!

713
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,874
I watched them
leave the garden...

714
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,958
...and waited till I was sure
that they were gone.

715
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,291
And then...

716
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,916
You swallowed the poison.

717
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,874
When did you first suspect
that I was...

718
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:27,374
When I saw the petrol
in the water butt.

719
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,208
Because that was the first stage
in your plan, was it not?

720
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,249
When M. Claude Langton,
he comes around

721
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,999
to destroy the nest of wasps
with a syringe of petrol,

722
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,374
he fails.

723
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,583
Why?

724
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,124
That is simple.

725
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:45,041
Because you have emptied

726
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,083
most of the contents of the can
into the water butt

727
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:49,958
and then filled the can
with the plain tap water.

728
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,666
You know that
when M. Langton comes back,

729
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,374
it will be with the cyanide --

730
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,999
the cyanide that you will use
for murder.

731
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,249
Not murder.

732
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:02,916
Suicide.

733
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,583
Murder!

734
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:08,624
The death
that you planned for yourself

735
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,874
was to be quick and easy.

736
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,083
But the death that you planned
for M. Claude Langton

737
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,458
was the worst death
that any man can die.

738
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,416
He bought the poison.
His name is there in the book.

739
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:19,874
After he has left your house,

740
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,749
you are found dead,
the cyanide in your cup,

741
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,666
and M. Claude Langton, he hangs.

742
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:27,749
That was your plan,
was it not, monsieur?

743
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:34,124
A few minutes from now,
it'll all be over.

744
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,708
I do not think so, my friend.

745
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,499
It is most unusual
for a man to die

746
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,416
from swallowing
the washing soda.

747
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,666
What?

748
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,416
Well, the substitution
was not difficult.

749
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,458
M. Claude Langton,
he really ought to purchase

750
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:55,499
a stronger lock
for his back door.

751
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,791
Poirot, I...

752
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,083
I don't know what to say.

753
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:15,874
Mon ami,
you are a man who is dying.

754
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,166
You have lost the girl you love.

755
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,458
But there is one thing
that you are not.

756
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,916
You are not a murderer
deep down within your heart.

757
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:33,874
I don't even want to kill
the wasps anymore.

758
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:39,583
Fact is,
I've become quite used to them.

759
00:50:57,834 --> 00:50:59,916
Stop by again, won't you,
before...

760
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,291
Before very long, mon ami.

761
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,541
And Poirot, I...

762
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:15,624
Thank God you came.
