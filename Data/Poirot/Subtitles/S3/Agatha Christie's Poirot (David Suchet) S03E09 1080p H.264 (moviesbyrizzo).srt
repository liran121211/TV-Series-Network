1
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,541
One of my father's
most valued possessions,

2
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,249
from the reign
of the Pharaoh Rameses.

3
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,208
Some more.

4
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:34,791
Yes, your highness.

5
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:36,041
And some coffee for the woman.

6
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,333
Very good, your highness.

7
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:42,916
Where are you going?

8
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,083
Just going to powder
my nose. Won't be a minute.

9
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:52,624
He wants another bottle of fizz.

10
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,499
He's been through two already,
him and the tart.

11
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,041
Where is she?

12
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,083
Beg your pardon, your highness?

13
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:05,958
The woman, where is she?

14
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,208
I couldn't say, your highness.

15
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,374
She's got my ruby!

16
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,083
Iris!

17
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,458
-Aah!
-Iris!

18
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,416
Iris.

19
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,249
You can't come in here,
your highness.

20
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,083
I do apologize, ladies.

21
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,708
Your lady friend left,
your highness.

22
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,083
She got a taxi and left.

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,541
Get Scotland Yard.

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,166
Now!

25
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,624
Merci.

26
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,291
Magnifique.

27
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:09,833
Oh! Thank you.

28
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,583
On your own for Christmas,
Mr. Poirot?

29
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:13,958
Yes, indeed.

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,666
Miss Lemon, she visits
an aunt at Torquay.

31
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,583
Ah.
And Captain Hastings?

32
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,958
En l'cosse.

33
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,166
Oh, pardon.
He is in Scotland.

34
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,958
So, yes, I am quite alone.

35
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,708
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr. Poirot.

36
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,708
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not at all.

37
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:31,999
A week of the complete peace
and repose,

38
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,999
the demi-kilo of your
chocolates most excellent,

39
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,374
is for Poirot
the Christmas parfait.

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,749
Thank you.

41
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,583
And a happy Christmas.

42
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,499
Merci.

43
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,416
Are you Mr. Hercule Poirot?

44
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,874
Yes, who are you?

45
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,666
Would you get in the car,
please, Mr. Poirot?

46
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,583
Mr. Jesmond
wants a word with you.

47
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,666
Why?

48
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:08,083
Just get in the car, please,
Mr. Poirot.

49
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,041
He was most insistent, sir.

50
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,749
Did M. Jesmond say
what he wanted me for?

51
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,291
Only that it's a matter
of national importance.

52
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,458
I am not empowered to say
anything more, Mr. Poirot.

53
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,833
Why should this
concern Poirot?

54
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,499
Why should this concern you?

55
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,416
This foolish young prince
whom you will not name,

56
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,999
he comes to London
to collect from Asprey's

57
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,249
the priceless ruby
which has been remounted.

58
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,499
Yes.

59
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,958
Foolishly, he becomes acquainted
with a young lady.

60
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,333
Well...

61
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,583
And continuing his foolishness,
he permits this young lady

62
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,999
to wear the jewel
in a restaurant

63
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,666
while they have dinner together.

64
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,041
I think, um --

65
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,166
No, no, no, no, no, no,
M. Jesmond,

66
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,958
if you please, I have listened,
you must now do likewise.

67
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,333
This fool,

68
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,958
this young prince,

69
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,166
isn't surprised
when this young lady

70
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,958
disappears with his jewel
into the night.

71
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,333
No, no, no, no, no.

72
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,374
No, this is a matter I think not
for Hercule Poirot.

73
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,749
This is a matter, I think,
for the commissioners in lunacy.

74
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,374
I like this fellow.
He's funny.

75
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,291
You are the prince.
Prince Farouk.

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,166
Heir to King Fuad of Egypt.

77
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,958
If it gets out,
the Wafd nationalists

78
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,916
will use the scandal, Poirot.

79
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,624
The Wafd want the British
out of Egypt completely.

80
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,874
They want total Egyptian control
of the Suez Canal now.

81
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,708
My father cannot live for long.

82
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,833
When he dies,
I inherit the throne.

83
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,124
Then I will show them.

84
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,208
Now, I am tired.

85
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,166
I am going back to the hotel.

86
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:41,749
No...

87
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,124
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
and again, no.

88
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,124
Poirot has squandered
his talents before.

89
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,583
Many times he has assisted fools
in their folly.

90
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,291
But this royal, rude,
arrogant fool, no.

91
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,708
Poirot draws a line.

92
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,291
It is imperative to British
interests, M. Poirot,

93
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,583
that the prince should succeed
to the throne.

94
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,499
And what about the interests
of the Egyptians?

95
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,624
You think he will be a ruler
that is wise and just?

96
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,624
M. Poirot, I beg of you.

97
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,124
The prince is still young.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,249
How young is he?

99
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,874
19.

100
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,791
Did anyone else
know about the ruby?

101
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,458
No one.

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,916
You did not talk about it
to anyone?

103
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,291
No.

104
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,791
Well, I may have done.

105
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,874
Perhaps when I was
at Kings Lacey.

106
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:44,083
But Colonel Lacey is
an old friend of my father's.

107
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,666
An Egyptologist.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,416
He is one of England's
most famous archeologists,

109
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,541
M. Poirot.

110
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,666
Kings Lacey is a magnet
for all sorts of people

111
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,916
with interests in Egypt.

112
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,291
Then perhaps it is at Kings
Lacey that the answer is found.

113
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,124
Was anyone else present?

114
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,291
Am I a criminal?

115
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,999
Am I to be questioned like this?

116
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,583
Iris Moffat took the ruby.
We all know this.

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Find Iris Moffat,
you will find the thief.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,833
No, no, no, no, I think not.

119
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:21,166
This robbery, it has been
planned with the utmost care.

120
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,833
One person alone
could not have carried it out.

121
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,458
Tell me, your highness,

122
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,708
was anyone else present

123
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,249
when you talked about the jewel
to Colonel Lacey?

124
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,458
No!
I don't know. Maybe.

125
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:39,583
Yes, there were children...
and a man with two names.

126
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,249
The Laceys are good friends
of mine, M. Poirot.

127
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
I may be able to concoct a story

128
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,208
that will enable you
to spend Christmas there.

129
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,583
Christmas?

130
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,208
I seem to remember my wife
telling me they were concerned

131
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,999
about their granddaughter's
choice of men friends.

132
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,583
No, no, no, no, M. Jesmond,

133
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
I have made other arrangements.

134
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,874
You see, I have my books,
my radio.

135
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,083
My demi-kilo

136
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,208
of excellent hand-made
chocolates from Dupres.

137
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,416
My radiators
that are nice and warm.

138
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,208
The Laceys are
very hospitable people,

139
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,583
M. Poirot,

140
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,749
and they have an excellent
central heating system.

141
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,499
You might do better
at auction,

142
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,999
you know, Colonel Lacey.

143
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,874
Oh, no, no, no, it's too public.

144
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,124
Em mustn't know about this.

145
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,791
Imagine the fuss she'd make.

146
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,041
I don't want to
sell anything, David.

147
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,124
I wish we had one item which
would cover the whole amount.

148
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,916
Something small
she wouldn't notice.

149
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,333
Haven't you still got
that little footstool

150
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,666
from the Amenhotep tomb?

151
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,708
Oh, I don't want to
part with that.

152
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,999
That was almost the first thing
to come out of my first dig.

153
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,916
Well, what do you suggest, then?

154
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,333
Oh, I don't know.

155
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,791
I don't want to part
with any of it.

156
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,124
Tell you what, come and spend
Christmas with us.

157
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,624
Have a good look at everything.

158
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,291
I don't like to impose on
Mrs. Lacey at such short notice.

159
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,666
Oh, nonsense!

160
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,583
She will be delighted.

161
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,416
Sarah is going to be there, too.

162
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,749
And that Lee-Wortley fellow,
I suppose.

163
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,583
Lee-Wortley, good chap.

164
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,458
Knows a lot about Egypt.

165
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,083
You'll have lots of things
to talk about.

166
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,208
You're keen on Sarah,
aren't you?

167
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,583
Well, yes.

168
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,499
But I think your granddaughter
is rather keener on Lee-Wortley.

169
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,874
Really?

170
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,374
Well, there you are, then.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,041
You got three days
to get her to see reason.

172
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,708
Come down Christmas Eve.

173
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,166
Peverill takes ages
to get to the door.

174
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,541
Peverill?

175
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,249
The butler.

176
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,124
He's 90, at least.
Who are you?

177
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,999
I am Hercule Poirot.
And you, monsieur?

178
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,833
Colin.

179
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,458
I'm Bridget.
He's my cousin.

180
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,958
You haven't seen Michael
anywhere, have you?

181
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,124
Batty-looking chap
with glasses.

182
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,499
No.

183
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,166
Good afternoon, sir.

184
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,708
Good afternoon to you,
M. Peverill.

185
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,624
Come on, Bridget.

186
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,624
This way, please, sir.

187
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Mr. Hercule Poirot, madame.

188
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,541
Mr. Poirot,
how very nice to meet you.

189
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,749
Mme. Lacey.

190
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,916
You have a most beautiful house.

191
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,333
Yes, isn't it?

192
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,833
It's this tree

193
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,708
I'm worried about
at the moment.

194
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,958
Is it vulgar enough yet,
do you think?

195
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:31,333
So good of you to come,
Mr. Poirot.

196
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,874
Oh, do please sit down.

197
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,874
Thank you, madame.

198
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,374
Edwina Jesmond tells me
that you were very helpful

199
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,916
to some friends of hers
in a case very like ours.

200
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,833
But perhaps you don't know
what I am talking about.

201
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,333
I understand that this is
a matter rather unfortunate

202
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,833
concerning the infatuation

203
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,208
of a young girl.

204
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,374
Yes, my granddaughter, Sarah.

205
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,666
She's got herself mixed up
with this dreadful man.

206
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,541
He calls himself
Desmond Lee-Wortley.

207
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,708
And this man, he has not
a good reputation?

208
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,416
Oh, indeed, he has not,

209
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,791
but it's no good
telling Sarah that.

210
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,416
Never any good
telling young girls

211
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,124
that a man has
a bad reputation, is it?

212
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,791
It is often, I believe,
an added attraction.

213
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,249
Yes, well, anyway,

214
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,958
Edwina Jesmond tells me
that you might be able to

215
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,458
find out something,
how shall I put it?

216
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:37,374
Something useful about
this Desmond Lee-Wortley.

217
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,041
How long
do I have to do this for?

218
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,624
Oh, you give it
a good old stir, sir.

219
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,166
Go on, Desmond, don't be lazy.

220
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,958
The longer you stir, sir,
the better your luck will be.

221
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,333
Why do you have two?

222
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,249
Well, the big one's
for Christmas Day,

223
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,708
and the small one's
for New Year, silly.

224
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,333
Ah.
Oh, yes.

225
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,416
Oh, Mr. Poirot,
you must have a stir, too.

226
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,833
Sarah won't let anyone else
have a go.

227
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,333
I need all the luck I can get.

228
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,958
This is Sarah, my granddaughter,
Mr. Poirot.

229
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:07,999
How do you do?

230
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,374
Mlle. Sarah.

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,749
And Mr. Lee-Wortley.

232
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,124
M. Lee-Wortley.

233
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,083
-Desmond.
-Desmond.

234
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,166
And Gloria Lee-Wortley,
his sister.

235
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,749
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

236
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,791
How do you do?

237
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,499
This is our maid, Annie.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,499
Mlle. Annie.

239
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,166
And I'm David Welwyn.

240
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,333
-Ah, M. Welwyn.
-How do you do?

241
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,374
And who, may I ask,
is responsible

242
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,041
for these puddings
most magnificent?

243
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,791
Oh, that would be me,
I reckon, sir.

244
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,041
This is Mrs. Ross, our cook.

245
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,124
Hello, Mme. Ross,
you are truly the artist.

246
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,291
-Oh, thank you very much, sir!
-Oh, no, no, no.

247
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,583
Pas de tous. The whole house,
it is redolent with the...

248
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,124
nutmeg, the ginger,
the allspice, the...

249
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,833
The brandy.

250
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,208
C'est true,
c'est magnifique.

251
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,208
Oh, thank you.

252
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,166
Are you going to have
a good old stir, sir?

253
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,541
It is permitted?

254
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,208
You just go right ahead, sir.

255
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,583
Go on, Mr. Poirot.

256
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,291
Merci beaucoup.

257
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,291
Bravo.

258
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,833
What do you think
of the glass vase?

259
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,291
The blue one?
I noticed it.

260
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,666
18th dynasty?

261
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,083
Yeah.

262
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,708
Horace, you're looking
very furtive.

263
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,249
-Stop it.
-No, my dear, not at all.

264
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,416
Ah, Mr. Poirot.

265
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,166
Horace, come and meet
Mr. Hercule Poirot.

266
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,541
Not the Hercule Poirot?

267
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,333
There is but one Hercule Poirot,
and I am he.

268
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,916
-The great detective?
-The same.

269
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,583
Let me see...

270
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,208
You are Michael.

271
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,791
How do you do, M. Poirot?

272
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,166
I am Horace Lacey.

273
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,833
Ah, I am indeed honored
to meet you, Colonel.

274
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,333
Ah, mangoes.

275
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,499
Look damn delicious,
don't they?

276
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,541
Indeed, they do, monsieur.

277
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,666
Don't be fooled.

278
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,583
They are absolutely
impossible to eat.

279
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:52,708
Indeed?

280
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,166
They come out of India.

281
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,083
Impossible to get
the stone out.

282
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,791
I spent the best years of my
life trying to hack the stone

283
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,166
out of mangoes.

284
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,541
Ah.
If I might demonstrate?

285
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,999
Oh.

286
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,666
Thank you.

287
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,749
Now, let me see.

288
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,374
With the tip of a sharp knife.

289
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,874
We insert it here
until we feel the pip.

290
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,833
Then we cut around the mango,
comme ça,

291
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,208
feeling the stone

292
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,666
all the time
with the tip of the knife.

293
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,166
Then with a spoon,

294
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,958
we insert it here

295
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,541
and go over and across
the stone,

296
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,416
all the way around,

297
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,958
until the fruit half,
it separates.

298
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,666
Then with a knife,

299
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:54,583
un, deux, trois.

300
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,416
Et voilà.

301
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,874
Good God above,
did you see that, Em?

302
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,499
There's an absolute marvel
with a mango.

303
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,124
Where did you learn that?

304
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,874
A duke taught me.

305
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,624
Shh!
Just the women.

306
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,624
Oh.

307
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,083
What's he doing here?
Why did they invite a detective?

308
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,458
I don't know.

309
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,666
He's dangerous, Desmond.
He's got to be dealt with.

310
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,291
Yeah, I know.

311
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,916
Where did you put it?

312
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,374
Why don't we put on a
show for that old Poirot fellow?

313
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,083
"There's but one Hercule Poirot,
and I am it."

314
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,958
What sort of a show?

315
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,624
We will arrange ze murder.

316
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,666
Ze bodies, still and cold,
ze young, so beautiful girl.

317
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,249
Moi, naturellement.

318
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,083
When shall we do it?

319
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,916
Come on, let's go inside
and talk about it.

320
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,583
"Do not eat none of
the plum pudding.

321
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,833
One as wishes you well."

322
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,749
Oh, let me have a go!

323
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,124
I haven't even tried it yet!

324
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,583
-Happy Christmas, Mr. Poirot.
-Happy Christmas, Michael.

325
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,083
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Colin.

326
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,416
What do you think you're doing?

327
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,541
It's ruined, completely ruined.

328
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,249
Oh, look at that.
Get off with you.

329
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,041
Come along.

330
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,333
Everyone has got to make a wish
before the flames go out.

331
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,666
Well done, Peverill.

332
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,791
Didn't get scorched
this year, eh?

333
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,916
Lots for me, please.

334
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,291
And me.

335
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,874
I'm so full.

336
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,541
For Mr. Poirot.

337
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,874
Merci, madame.

338
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,374
You don't like Christmas
pudding, Mr. Poirot.

339
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,749
Au contraire,

340
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,291
I am inordinately fond of
the plum pudding.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,333
Aww, I got the thimble.

342
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,999
Old maid.

343
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,333
I've got the pig.

344
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,958
There you are,
there's justice for you.

345
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,166
I've got something,

346
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:36,583
bit of damned glass.

347
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,499
How did that get in there?

348
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,208
I could have broken
my damned tooth.

349
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,041
You will permit me, madame?

350
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,166
Perhaps it's a ruby.

351
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,916
If it was a ruby,
it would be worth thousands.

352
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,291
No, it is not a ruby,

353
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,624
it is simply glass.

354
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,208
I've got a sixpence!

355
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,749
Mme. Ross?

356
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,416
Yes, sir?

357
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,958
Oh, no, no, no,
please to be seated.

358
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:24,624
It is permitted
that I congratulate the cook

359
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,958
on a luncheon delicieux.

360
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:30,208
Oh, just plain
English cooking, sir.

361
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,499
There is none better.

362
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,208
You will allow me?

363
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,833
Thank you very much, sir.

364
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,583
And the pudding, oh.

365
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,791
Well, thank you, sir.

366
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,124
As a matter of fact, I served
the wrong pudding today.

367
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,583
How is that, Mme. Ross?

368
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,624
Well, I usually make two,
one for New Year's Day.

369
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,166
There was a bit of an accident
this morning.

370
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,708
One of the boys ran straight
in here and into Annie

371
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,874
as she was just putting it
into the steamer.

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,249
Quel désastre.

373
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,958
Oh, you should have seen
the mess, sir.

374
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,333
So, anyway,

375
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,374
I served the New Year's
pudding instead.

376
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,999
Ah.

377
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,749
I have the pleasure
to inform your highness

378
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,208
that I have been successful.

379
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,833
Where is the thief?

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,916
The thief?

381
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,124
No, no, no, no, no, Poirot.

382
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,958
M. Poirot has done a magnificent
job, your highness.

383
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,208
You're supposed to
catch the thief!

384
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:53,916
I'm afraid we do need to know
the real identity of the thief.

385
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,083
We suspect there is a cell
of Wafd sympathizers --

386
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,583
The Wafd are animals.

387
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,916
My father
is too soft with them.

388
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,958
Who are supporting
the Wafd financially.

389
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,166
We must neutralize them.

390
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:05,541
Neuter them.

391
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,333
I was not informed of this.

392
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:11,874
I am sorry.

393
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,624
We assumed that when you
retrieved the ruby,

394
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,958
you would also apprehend
the culprit.

395
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,333
Then we will neutralize her,
also.

396
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,708
It is in this country's
interest, too, M. Poirot.

397
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,833
You really have only completed
half the task.

398
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,791
Very well.

399
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,666
What are you doing?

400
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,333
If I am to catch the thief,

401
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:44,583
I will need the ruby as bait.

402
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:48,416
Okay.

403
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,374
Thank you.

404
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,999
I must apologize for the prince,
M. Poirot.

405
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,416
-He is --
-Young?

406
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,541
One is never too young
to learn the manners.

407
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,916
Indeed, indeed.

408
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,958
Unfortunately, the prince has
never seen any reason to do so.

409
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,374
Why not?

410
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,124
Look, you said the 23rd.

411
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,749
You could have milled the part
yourself in less time.

412
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:34,749
Are you quite sure about that?

413
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,916
Well, yes, of course
we'll be there!

414
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,708
-Still not ready?
-Tomorrow.

415
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,833
It seems he had some sort of
problem -- Ah, good morning.

416
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,708
Good morning.

417
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,208
-Em?
-Yes, dear.

418
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,624
That detective fellow.

419
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,666
Uh-huh.

420
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,958
I think he's foreign
or something.

421
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,124
I'll tell you why.

422
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,374
When he went up to bed last
night, he said "bon soir, "

423
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,458
instead of "good night,"
that is.

424
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,541
That's "good night" in French.

425
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,958
Well, at first, I thought
he's being facetious.

426
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,666
Then I thought back --

427
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,958
Very amusing, Horace.

428
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,958
-Bonjour, mademoiselle.
-Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.

429
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,666
You haven't seen Desmond
anywhere, have you?

430
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,541
Yes, he was in the drawing room
with his sister, mademoiselle.

431
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,208
I've looked there.

432
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,041
You still won't part
with the Amenhotep footstool?

433
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,666
No, no, I can't.

434
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,458
What about the blue vase?

435
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:21,833
Absolutely not.

436
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:23,458
It's just not on.

437
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,499
-The painted coffin?
-No.

438
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,458
Colonel Lacey, I know
this is difficult for you.

439
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,749
But you asked me down here
to look at your collection

440
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,083
with a view to purchasing one --

441
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,583
I know, I know.

442
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,833
Listen to me, David,

443
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:42,333
perhaps I don't really have to
sell anything after all.

444
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,166
What?

445
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:48,333
Circumstances change, you know.

446
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,833
Oh, Desmond! I've been looking
for you everywhere.

447
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,499
Do you want to come and see
the obelisk?

448
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,333
-Can't wait.
-Yeah, that would be nice.

449
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,624
Gloria, you don't have to come.

450
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,166
It will be lunch soon, anyway.

451
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,458
Obelisks always give me
an appetite. Lead on.

452
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,374
Who's next?
Grandma, it's your turn.

453
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,708
No, no, no,
it's for you children.

454
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,874
Now, Bridget, what about you?
I know you've got a good one.

455
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,249
Come on, come on.

456
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,541
Now, then, what is it?

457
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,208
Is it a book?

458
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,083
No, film -- oops!

459
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:33,708
Did I ever tell you that I used
to be a waiter at the Savoy?

460
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,999
-Oh, careful, careful!
-It's all right, it's all right.

461
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,541
You'd be very unpopular
if you dropped it.

462
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,833
Yes, but not with you, though.

463
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,374
No, not with me.

464
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:08,833
It's a book.

465
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,708
Two words.

466
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:14,208
First word.

467
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,208
-Nuts.
-Bowl.

468
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:18,458
-Berry?
-Holly.

469
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,166
You're not supposed to
use objects.

470
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,499
Second syllable.

471
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:25,791
Jacket.

472
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,249
Frock, holly frock.

473
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,874
Coat?
Collar!

474
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,666
Necklace.

475
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:34,041
Fur.

476
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,249
Holly fur?
What's that meant to mean?

477
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,624
I must say, David,

478
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,333
I don't think
you've quite grasped

479
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,083
the rudiments of this game.

480
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,208
-Ring?
-Second word.

481
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:48,833
-Turn.
-Rinse.

482
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,333
-Strangle.
-Washing.

483
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:55,791
-Screw.
-Drive.

484
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,208
Holly, fir, screw?

485
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,124
No, no, no, no.

486
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,583
It is, I think,

487
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,458
"Oliver Twist"?

488
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,666
Right.
Holly, fur, twist.

489
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,416
Well done, Mr. Poirot,
you win again.

490
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,124
Now it's your turn.

491
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,791
No, no, no, no,
please forgive me.

492
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,874
All of a sudden, I am tired.

493
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,708
I will, I think, retire.

494
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:23,958
But it's only 10:00.

495
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,458
It is perhaps the Christmas
pudding that affects me.

496
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:31,374
I am not used to
such Lucullian fare.

497
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,958
I thank you for
a most enjoyable Christmas,

498
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:36,749
and I wish you all
good night.

499
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,083
Good night.

500
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,666
Well, come on, Michael,
it's your go.

501
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,374
No, no, I'm no good.

502
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,791
Mr. Poirot!
Mr. Poirot!

503
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,499
Bonjour.

504
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,958
Mr. Poirot, can you help us?

505
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:32,083
Something awful has happened.

506
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,291
Oh, mon Dieu!
This is horrible.

507
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,208
It is like something
in the theater!

508
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:57,999
Well, that's how
we found her, Mr. Poirot.

509
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,749
You boys, you have
touched nothing?

510
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,458
No, we haven't been near her.

511
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,708
There are footprints.

512
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,249
The footprints of a man.

513
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,833
They arrive with the girl...

514
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:13,874
But they depart alone.

515
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,458
You are amused?

516
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,291
It's all right, Bridget,
you can get up now.

517
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,708
I do not understand.

518
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,916
It's all a joke, Mr. Poirot.

519
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,541
This is no joke, mes amis.

520
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,624
The young lady,
she has no pulse.

521
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,999
Bridget!

522
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,624
Help! Someone help!

523
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:50,458
Grandma! Grandma!
Something terrible has happened!

524
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:51,833
Help, help!

525
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,416
What's going on?

526
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,083
Good God.

527
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,333
The boys, they planned a comedy.

528
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,041
It has turned into a tragedy.

529
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,374
-She's dead?
-I think there can be no doubt.

530
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,249
I can detect no pulse.
You try.

531
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,624
-No, no --
-No, please, just for me.

532
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,083
My hands are very cold.

533
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,958
The pulse,
it might be very faint.

534
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,124
Well...

535
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,666
No, nothing.

536
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,416
Not even a slight flutter?

537
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,833
No.
Look, I think someone had

538
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:30,583
better get the police,
all right? I'll go.

539
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,499
-You stay here.
-Very well, mon ami.

540
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,916
But hurry, the miscreant
may try to run away.

541
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,374
I'll be as quick as I can.

542
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,749
Horace?

543
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:46,499
Horace! Horace!

544
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:56,624
Sarah?
Sarah!

545
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,666
Sarah?

546
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:58,916
Sa--

547
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,249
I can't wake him,
so I went along to find Sarah

548
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,499
and she's not in
her bedroom.

549
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,999
Now, where is she?
Have you seen her?

550
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,083
-Bridget's dead.
-What?

551
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,666
Mr. Poirot says
she hasn't got a pulse.

552
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,083
What do you mean?

553
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,541
Poirot, what on earth
is going on?

554
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,583
What's happened to Bridget?

555
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,083
Well, tell her, Mr. Poirot.

556
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:21,458
Tell her what?

557
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:23,416
Bridget!

558
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,666
We thought you were dead!

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,333
You played a trick on us?

560
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,208
A trick, yes, but not on you.

561
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,374
You all right, Mlle. Bridget?

562
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,749
I'm fine.

563
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:35,833
But my husband,
I can't wake him.

564
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,958
And I can't find Sarah!

565
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,124
If M. Desmond Lee-Wortley
intended to

566
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,416
leave this country in haste,
where might he go?

567
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,291
He's got his own
private airplane.

568
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,708
Where does he keep it?

569
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,541
At the aerodrome, near Elstree.

570
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,874
M. Welwyn, you have a car?

571
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,166
Yes.

572
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,541
Bon. On y va.

573
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:54,708
But where is Sarah?
I must see Sarah!

574
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,333
So, when you were making off

575
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,708
with Farouk's family jewels
in London,

576
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,291
I was 50 miles away, down here.

577
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,374
The perfect alibi.
We've done it.

578
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:08,666
Paris by lunchtime,
a New Year's wedding in Cairo.

579
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,666
A new life.

580
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,833
How far is it
to Elstree Aerodrome?

581
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:19,374
About 12 miles.

582
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,083
You care for Mlle. Sarah, yes?

583
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,291
That's why I came
down here, really.

584
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,208
There was no other reason?

585
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:38,583
Yes, all right.

586
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,416
Colonel Lacey's taken a crash
on the stock market.

587
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,874
He's having to sell
some of his artworks.

588
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,624
But he doesn't want
anyone else to know.

589
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,416
-Ah.
-Not even Mrs. Lacey.

590
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,416
I comprehend, M. Welwyn.

591
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,416
Poirot shall be
discretion himself.

592
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,999
I only came down here
really to see Sarah.

593
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,874
I can't make her out,
Mr. Poirot.

594
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,708
Can't think why she's run off
with this Lee-Wortley fellow.

595
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:02,291
She's just infatuated.

596
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,333
You have not lost her yet,
mon ami.

597
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,374
But now we must make haste

598
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,166
if we are to catch them.

599
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,041
Not far now.

600
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,374
Hold it.

601
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:31,999
Oh, mon Dieu!

602
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,249
Back off a bit, sir,
give us some room.

603
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,916
Thank you.
Come on.

604
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:38,249
That's it. Steady.

605
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:39,833
Don't worry,
I've got an idea.

606
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,166
Where is it you are going?

607
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,124
Hold tight.

608
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,749
Oi, you can't do that!

609
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,916
What's your hurry?

610
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,249
Put your backs
into it, lads.

611
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,124
The lady and gentleman
are in a hurry.

612
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,291
Here we are.

613
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,749
We've made it.

614
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,208
Let us hope so, mon ami.

615
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,041
There, look.

616
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,499
We're too late.

617
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,999
I think not.

618
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,791
You'll hit them, Desmond!

619
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,374
Keep quiet!

620
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,749
Right!
Hang on!

621
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,749
Quick, constable!

622
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,124
You know what to do.

623
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:10,708
Right, constable.

624
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,083
Hold it right there, sir.

625
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,499
You have something
that does not belong to you,

626
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,791
M. Lee-Wortley.

627
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,333
So you finally caught up
with me, Jesmond, have you?

628
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,958
Well, you're not going to be
fomenting trouble

629
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:29,291
for a few years.

630
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,541
Do you think I'm the only person
fighting to free Egypt?

631
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,833
I'm a very small cog,
I can assure you.

632
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,416
Yes, I'm sure you are.

633
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,499
Thank you, M. Lee-Wortley.

634
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,249
Take him away.

635
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,291
Come and give me a hand.
Sarah's trapped.

636
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,374
It's his sister!
Where's Sarah?

637
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,833
How in the hell should I know?

638
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,666
And I'm not his sister.

639
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,458
All right, madame, come along.

640
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:17,208
That's her!
That's Iris Moffat.

641
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,374
Strumpet!

642
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,374
You steal my jewels, eh?
Harlot!

643
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,749
And you, fatty.

644
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,249
-Fatty? I --
-Dignity, your highness.

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,499
Ah, yes, yes.
Dignity.

646
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,708
Daughter of a licentious camel!

647
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,374
Ah, Poirot.

648
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,749
These girls, eh?

649
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,208
Do you still have the ruby?

650
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,749
We can hardly thank you enough,
M. Poirot.

651
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,249
Quite, quite.
We will give you an honor.

652
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,041
Would you like the Order of
the Golden Snake?

653
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,833
Your highness is too kind.

654
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,124
Yes, I will see my father
about it.

655
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,166
Mr. Poirot, where is Sarah?

656
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,749
I mean, if she's not
with Lee-Wortley, then --

657
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,124
I'm afraid that I misled you,
M. Welwyn.

658
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,208
Earlier this morning,

659
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,791
I sent Mlle. Sarah

660
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,041
to warn his highness.

661
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,791
She is a good-looking woman, eh?

662
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,791
Eh voilà, the ruby.

663
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:27,791
I am afraid, Mlle. Sarah,

664
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,624
that it is evident to me
that the flirtations with you

665
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,374
of M. Desmond Lee-Wortley

666
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,541
had been
most carefully planned.

667
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,208
Just a camouflage, you mean?

668
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,374
Oui, I regret.

669
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,666
He was in need of an alibi.

670
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,499
He must not be seen in London
while the woman that you knew

671
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,166
only as his sister
stole the jewel.

672
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:50,666
He then had to wait for her
to bring it to him here.

673
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,999
Why didn't he just buzz off
as soon as they got it?

674
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,124
Well, that had been
their intention, Colonel Lacey,

675
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:57,916
but unfortunately for them,

676
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,791
the airplane developed
the engine trouble,

677
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,416
they had to wait for it
to be mended.

678
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,083
Why not?
You said the 23rd.

679
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,291
Yes, well, you could have milled
the part yourself in less time.

680
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,958
Once I discovered the ruby

681
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,458
in the otherwise most excellent
Christmas pudding...

682
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:16,749
You will permit me, madame?

683
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,333
Perhaps it's a ruby.

684
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,124
I strongly suspected
M. Lee-Wortley,

685
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,499
but I had no proof.

686
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,374
So you set a cunning trap.

687
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,958
As you say, M. Michael,
I set a cunning trap.

688
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,333
I used to be a waiter
at the Savoy.

689
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,083
Careful!

690
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:35,624
It's all right,
it's all right.

691
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,958
You would be very unpopular
if you drop it.

692
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:40,166
He knew that
I had the jewel,

693
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,708
and it was essential to his plan
that he retrieve it.

694
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:45,791
No, not with me.

695
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,499
But unfortunately for him,

696
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,041
I was, by chance,

697
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:55,458
witness to a scene
between himself and Mlle. Sarah

698
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:58,916
in which he tried to ensure that
I could no longer hinder him

699
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:01,541
by drugging my coffee.

700
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,124
Thus forewarned,

701
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:07,249
I was able to substitute
my coffee

702
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,041
for that of Colonel Lacey.

703
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,416
I don't think you've a grasp of
the rudiments of this game.

704
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,666
Horace.

705
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,333
Horace?

706
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:18,708
Horace!

707
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,249
You see, that's why
I couldn't wake you up.

708
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,708
Please accept my sincere
apologies, Colonel,

709
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,916
but it was necessary
to confirm my suspicions.

710
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,041
While I pretended to be asleep,

711
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:35,166
M. Lee-Wortley searched my room.

712
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,333
Believing me to be
in a drugged stupor,

713
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,958
he had no fear
of being apprehended.

714
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:51,208
Of course, he found nothing,
because the ruby,

715
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,416
it was in my hand.

716
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,249
So, what did you do then?

717
00:42:58,084 --> 00:42:59,333
He came to see me.

718
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:02,041
I had heard Colin and Michael
making a plot,

719
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:04,833
so I arranged

720
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,833
a little counter-plot
of my own.

721
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,166
Why don't we put on a
show for that old Poirot fellow?

722
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,541
What sort of a show?

723
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,458
We will arrange ze murder.

724
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,166
Ze body, still and cold.

725
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,791
I turned their deception

726
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,374
into a deception of my own.

727
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,999
I thought I'd bust
holding my breath.

728
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,458
I knew she wasn't dead.

729
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:26,833
No, you didn't.

730
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,708
No, but it was enough
that M. Lee-Wortley

731
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,374
was persuaded of the fact.

732
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:32,916
He saw his chance
to take the ruby and run.

733
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:34,874
As soon as he ran,
I had my proof.

734
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:38,041
The rest you know.

735
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,624
Hold on, well,
you still haven't told us

736
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,166
how this jewel came to be in
the pudding in the first place.

737
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,374
Ah, M. Lee-Wortley
and his "sister"

738
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:52,291
were in the kitchen,
stirring the pudding.

739
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,666
Enchanté.

740
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,833
They recognized my name
and assumed that I was there

741
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:58,374
in pursuit of the jewel.

742
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,583
And, of course, they panicked.

743
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,458
And hid it in the pudding.

744
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:06,083
The New Year Day pudding, yes.

745
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,166
But when the Christmas Day
pudding was dropped,

746
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,999
the New Year Day pudding
was served instead.

747
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,374
Yes, sir.

748
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,874
And the ruby discovered.

749
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,041
Would've broken my tooth.

750
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,041
But there is one thing

751
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:22,541
that Poirot does not understand.

752
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:26,708
This note,

753
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,416
it was placed in my bed,

754
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,291
and still I do not know
who wrote it.

755
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,708
I, Hercule Poirot,

756
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:39,124
whose business it is
to know everything.

757
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:42,874
"Do not eat none of
the plum pudding.

758
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,083
One as wishes you well."

759
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,083
Annie?

760
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:52,458
Excuse me, sir,

761
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,041
I couldn't help
but overhear you.

762
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,416
It was me.

763
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:58,958
But why?

764
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:00,958
I heard them, sir.

765
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,874
That Mr. Wortley
and his sister.

766
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:09,124
Mr. Lee-Wortley
and his sister

767
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,249
were standing behind me
in church.

768
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,624
I couldn't help
but hear them talking.

769
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,458
What's he doing here?
Why did they invite a detective?

770
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:17,833
I don't know.

771
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:21,374
He's dangerous, Desmond.
He's got to be dealt with.

772
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,749
Yeah, I know.

773
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,416
Where did you put it?

774
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:26,833
In the pudding.

775
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,749
I thought they meant
to poison you, sir.

776
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,166
In the plum pudding.

777
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,958
I didn't know what to do.

778
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:39,666
I couldn't tell Mrs. Ross.

779
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,458
She wouldn't listen
to the likes of me.

780
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:42,833
So you left the note.

781
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,999
Yes, sir.

782
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:52,416
Mlle. Annie...

783
00:45:56,917 --> 00:46:00,249
...you have the gratitude
most sincere of Hercule Poirot.

784
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,749
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

785
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,291
-Goodbye, Mr. Poirot.
-Au revoir.

786
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,624
-Goodbye, sir.
-Au revoir, au revoir.

787
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,874
Colonel Lacey.

788
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,416
Dear Mr. Poirot,
you really have made this

789
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,416
a most memorable Christmas
for us all.

790
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,249
And, perhaps, madame, your own
little problem is also solved,

791
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,874
n'est-ce pas?

792
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,916
It certainly seems so.

793
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,166
Such a nice young man,
don't you think?

794
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,541
Yes, indeed.

795
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,624
Au revoir, Mme. Lacey.

796
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,291
Thank you, M. Peverill.

797
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:42,416
-Goodbye!
-Au revoir!
