1
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:17,916
-Morning, Mr. Shaw.
-Good morning, Mr. Vavasour.

2
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,083
Terrible weather, Mr. Shaw.

3
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,333
Yes. Shocking.

4
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,333
I'll see you at the bank,
Mr. Shaw.

5
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,916
Right, Mr. Vavasour.

6
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,499
-Morning, gov.
-Morning.

7
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,249
Here!
Look out, gov!

8
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,291
Oh!

9
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,249
My dear Mr. Shaw!
Are you all right?

10
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,541
Yes.

11
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,958
Yes.
Yes, I think so.

12
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,124
Here, he done that on purpose.

13
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,333
He was trying to kill ya!

14
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,874
It weighs 80,000 tons, you know?

15
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,791
That is heavy, Hastings.

16
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,499
It's over 1,000 feet long.

17
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,583
Yes, Hastings.

18
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,833
Its siren can be heard
10 miles away.

19
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:54,833
10 miles, Poirot.

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,249
Oh, mon Dieu.

21
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,166
I'd give my eyeteeth
to be on this maiden voyage.

22
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,874
I mean,
it's an engineering marvel.

23
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,416
It is a marvel to me, Hastings,

24
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,666
how anyone wishes to travel
on such a contraption.

25
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,749
Contraption?
The Queen Mary?

26
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,499
Poirot, you're going too far.

27
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,666
No, Hastings.
I'm going nowhere.

28
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,124
Even to contemplate such a
matter gives me the mal de mer.

29
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,749
I can assure you, Poirot,

30
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,499
you wouldn't be seasick
on the Queen Mary.

31
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,666
Steady as a rock.

32
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,333
Hastings, it is 20 years ago

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,124
that I came to this country
in a boat across the channel,

34
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,249
and still I am not recovered.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,333
Mr. Poirot.

36
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,124
This just came for you
by personal messenger.

37
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,374
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

38
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,458
The London and Scottish Bank.

39
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,583
We don't have an account there,
do we?

40
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,958
No.

41
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,708
Mr. Poirot
did have some problems

42
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,124
with his bank last year.

43
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,458
The chairman was arrested.

44
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:51,624
Yes, I remember.

45
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,333
It was Poirot who put the man
behind bars.

46
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,833
This is most unusual.

47
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,874
Indeed a circumstance unique.

48
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,749
An attempted murder.

49
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,958
American Liberty Bonds.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,416
Have they been robbed?

51
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:07,124
Not yet, Miss Lemon.

52
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,916
But they think
that they are going to be.

53
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,291
And when they are,

54
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,583
there is at stake
the sum of $1 million.

55
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,291
Mr. Poirot, are you aware
of the nature of Liberty Bonds?

56
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,249
I have no personal experience.

57
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,416
They're the equivalent
of blank checks,

58
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,541
payable to whosoever holds them.

59
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,708
And so if they were
to be mislaid?

60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,541
Same as losing cash.
It would ruin us.

61
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,249
Tell me, M. Shaw,

62
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,791
why is it necessary
to transport these bonds?

63
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,749
The bank is currently
extending its credit

64
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,791
in America, Mr. Poirot.

65
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,124
We must have funds in place
in New York.

66
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,166
-Please.
-Thank you.

67
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,374
And it is M. Shaw
who will take them?

68
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,708
Yes.
In two days' time.

69
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,749
He'll be traveling
on the Queen Mary.

70
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,124
I say!

71
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,666
Oh. Sorry.

72
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,583
Now, if M. Shaw were unable
to make this journey,

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,666
who would travel in his place?

74
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,749
The assistant general manager.
Mr. Ridgeway.

75
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,958
Mr. Ridgeway is above suspicion.

76
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,083
I would certainly
like to think so.

77
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,999
Why is that, M. Vavasour?

78
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,458
He has been with the bank
for seven years.

79
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,708
He's also engaged
to my secretary.

80
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,416
Yes, gentlemen.

81
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,791
I will examine this matter
for you.

82
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,291
Really, Mr. Vavasour.

83
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,666
No, Mr. Shaw.
That car tried to kill you.

84
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,458
I saw it with my own eyes.

85
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,958
The red sports car?

86
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,416
A Singer, you think?

87
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:09,958
Uh, yes.

88
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,833
But you were unable
to make out

89
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,166
the number of the registration?

90
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,874
It happened too quickly.

91
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,416
And to be truthful,
my eyesight is not good.

92
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,666
I'm sorry, Mr. Vavasour.

93
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,333
I still think you're
blowing this whole thing

94
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:23,374
out of proportion.

95
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,833
We'll let Mr. Poirot
be the judge of that.

96
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,916
You'd better have a word
with our Mr. McNeil.

97
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,624
He's the head of security.

98
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,374
I'm sure you'll find him
more than helpful.

99
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,666
I have to tell you, Mr. Poirot,
I consider your presence here

100
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,624
to be a gross intrusion
in my affairs.

101
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,374
That, I would say,
is for M. Vavasour to decide.

102
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,291
I'll have you know
that in the five years

103
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,874
that I have been
head of security here,

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,416
not so much as a paper clip
has gone astray.

105
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,166
M. McNeil, I'm sure
if such a thing were to happen,

106
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,916
you would be the man
ideal for the case.

107
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,416
Here it is, Mr. Poirot.

108
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,291
The portmanteau in which
the bonds will travel.

109
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,958
I had it built to my own design.

110
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,708
Steel plate inside.

111
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,166
Five-lever lock.
Hardened steel.

112
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,666
Clutch screws here and here.

113
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,666
There are just three keys.

114
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,166
One for Mr. Shaw
and one for Mr. Vavasour.

115
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,458
And the third?

116
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,833
For me, of course.

117
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,499
And what if M. Ridgeway
had to make the journey?

118
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,916
Mr. Ridgeway?

119
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,749
Well, that's the bank's lookout,

120
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,666
but I'd have to say he would not
be my first choice as courier.

121
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,124
And why is that, M. McNeil?

122
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,291
You're the detective,
Mr. Poirot.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,999
You work it out.

124
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,833
Goodbye.

125
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,333
Thank you, Sandra.

126
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,583
Mr. Poirot, isn't it?

127
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,583
M. Ridgeway.
My associate, Captain Hastings.

128
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,083
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

129
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,791
-Please sit down, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

130
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,874
I suppose you've come
about Mr. Shaw.

131
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,708
You heard what took place?

132
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,499
Yes.
But I'm sure it was an accident.

133
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,583
Why?

134
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,416
Well, I mean,
who's gonna knock off old Shaw?

135
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,249
He's utterly harmless
and dry as old bones.

136
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,458
Mm.

137
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,999
I understand that you yourself
would travel to America

138
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,416
if M. Shaw were indisposed.

139
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:08,791
Yes.
A bit of fun, eh?

140
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,666
And on the Queen Mary, too.

141
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,208
I'll say.

142
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,833
You would like to go?

143
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,208
Of course I would.

144
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,499
Oh, but not enough to...

145
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,791
You don't think...

146
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,666
What car do you drive,
M. Ridgeway?

147
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,874
I don't.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,958
I did have a car.
It was a Singer.

149
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,666
The color?

150
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,874
Red.
But I haven't had it for weeks.

151
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,999
You see, I sold it.

152
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,708
I didn't like it.

153
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,583
It was the ignition.

154
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,333
I could never get
the damn thing to start.

155
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,166
He was lying.

156
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,333
He was not, perhaps,
telling the truth in entirety.

157
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,499
The Singer's got
a brand-new ignition system.

158
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,041
Racing start.
It's the best on the road.

159
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,541
Ah, Hastings.
Always the enthusiast.

160
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,999
Mr. Poirot?

161
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,291
Might I...

162
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,166
Can I talk to you?

163
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,833
My name is Esmee Dalgleish.

164
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,416
I'm engaged to be married
to Philip Ridgeway.

165
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,416
Ah, I'd say
he's a very lucky man.

166
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,458
Thank you.

167
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,624
And you're also
the secretary of M. Vavasour?

168
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,249
Yes, that's right.

169
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,833
How can I help you,
mademoiselle?

170
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,458
Mr. Poirot, may I speak to you
in confidence?

171
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,583
You have my assurance,
mademoiselle.

172
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,958
I love Philip very much.

173
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,499
We hope to be married
in the autumn.

174
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,833
But it's just these bonds,
Mr. Poirot.

175
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,416
The money.

176
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,791
It concerns you?

177
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:47,333
Yes.

178
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,041
Because if Mr. Shaw were unable
to go to America,

179
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,874
Philip would take his place.

180
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,416
And I'm afraid for him,
Mr. Poirot.

181
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:57,499
You're afraid
someone might attack him?

182
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,999
Well... yes.

183
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,874
There's no saying
what some people might do

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,249
for such a sum of money.

185
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,958
Mr. Poirot, I know you will do
everything you can,

186
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,666
but, please, I beg of you,
keep an eye on Philip.

187
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,458
Whatever happens.

188
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,499
I'm frightened
he's going to come to harm.

189
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,791
You're very punctual,
Mr. Ridgeway.

190
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,541
Time for a pint?

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,749
No.

192
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:41,083
No.
I have to get back to the bank.

193
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,458
Ah, yes.

194
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:44,833
And the money?

195
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,208
It's on its way.

196
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,999
Another week, that's all.

197
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,374
Another week?

198
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,874
10 days.

199
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,499
No more.

200
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,249
I promise you.

201
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,958
It's all arranged.

202
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,708
Ah.
Thank you, Mrs. Winter.

203
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,416
Mr. Poirot.
Thank goodness you're back.

204
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,458
What is it, Miss Lemon?

205
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,916
It's the bank.
They telephoned.

206
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:58,833
Their Mr. Shaw --
He's been poisoned!

207
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,666
Good evening.
We wish to see a M. Shaw.

208
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,999
And you are?

209
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,624
Hercule Poirot.

210
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,041
Oh, yes.
Come in.

211
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,583
Thank you.

212
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,624
-How is he?
-Still very weak.

213
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,958
-It was strychnine, you know?
-Strychnine?

214
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:32,333
In his coffee.

215
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
More guests, Mr. Shaw.

216
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,749
Just five minutes, then sleep.

217
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,833
Thank you.
Thank you, Nurse Long.

218
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,624
Mr. -- Mr. Poirot --

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,249
No, no, no, M. Shaw. Please.
You must not tire yourself.

220
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:49,958
It was a close thing,
Mr. Poirot.

221
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,374
One more mouthful --

222
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,374
I have begun an investigation.

223
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,041
It could have been anyone.

224
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,124
-Anyone.
-Yes.

225
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:00,666
But at least we have ascertained

226
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,749
who was the last person
in Mr. Shaw's office

227
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,583
before the coffee was drunk.

228
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,499
And who was that, M. McNeil?

229
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,833
The same person who will
now be taking the bonds.

230
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,416
Mr. Ridgeway.

231
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,333
I thought you were going to
take me out this evening.

232
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,249
I was. And I want to.
But I can't.

233
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,874
I'm sorry, old girl.
It's business.

234
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:26,666
It's always business.

235
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,916
Well, you should talk to
old Vavasour.

236
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,333
He's the one to blame.

237
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,916
Philip...

238
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,124
-Do you still love me?
-What?

239
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,291
Of course I do.

240
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,583
I'm wild about you.

241
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:40,624
I never see you anymore.

242
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh.

243
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,124
Things will get better

244
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:49,041
once I just... turn the corner.

245
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,458
Look...

246
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,166
I got to fly.

247
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,041
Oh!

248
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,708
Darling, look,
damn silly of me --

249
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,833
I, uh, left my wallet
at the office.

250
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,874
Oh, Philip.

251
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,499
I seem to keep doing this,
don't I?

252
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,124
I've got a couple of pounds.

253
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,208
I'm sorry, darling.

254
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,208
Philip, look,
if you're in trouble...

255
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,624
Of course I'm not in trouble.

256
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,958
You can tell me.

257
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,958
Everything's going to be fine.

258
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,374
See you tomorrow.

259
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,624
The keys, Mr. McNeil.

260
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,333
You know what to do when you
reach New York, Mr. Ridgeway?

261
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,749
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

262
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,499
One for you, Mr. Ridgeway.

263
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,999
Mr. McNeil, you are responsible

264
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,291
for delivering that to Mr. Shaw
at his home.

265
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:53,666
Very good, sir.

266
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,083
And one for me.

267
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,499
Is Mr. Shaw
still not better, sir?

268
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,541
I'm afraid not, Miss Dalgleish.

269
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,541
He's going to be in bed
for at least two weeks.

270
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,749
I'd be glad
to make the journey, sir.

271
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,124
Thank you, Mr. McNeil.

272
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,958
But there's business to be done
in New York

273
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:16,166
which in Mr. Shaw's absence
only Mr. Ridgeway can handle.

274
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,416
It's only 10 days, old girl.

275
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,916
They say it's going to be
the fastest crossing ever.

276
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,999
You may be sure
I'm taking no chances

277
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,499
with your fiancé's safety,
Miss Dalgleish.

278
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,708
After what has happened
to Mr. Shaw.

279
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,708
I have asked Mr. Poirot
to accompany the bonds.

280
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,124
He's letting me know
later today.

281
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:37,166
With due respect, I can't
quite see what's to be gained

282
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,583
by employing a Belgian.

283
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,374
It's just
these bonds, Mr. Poirot.

284
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,708
The money.

285
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,541
I love Philip very much.

286
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,958
I know you will do
everything you can,

287
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:01,416
but, please, I beg of you,
keep an eye on Philip.

288
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,833
Come on, Johnathan.
It's time we were home.

289
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,374
I've put in your blue tie
and the mauve silk waistcoat.

290
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,958
And I shall take also
the brown suit

291
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,624
and the two waistcoats
that coordinate.

292
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:31,249
You can't take your
entire wardrobe, Mr. Poirot.

293
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,791
-Poirot.
-Ah, Hastings. Enfin.

294
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,541
You must begin at once
the packing.

295
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,666
-We're going?
-On the Queen Mary.

296
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,791
What, you and me?

297
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,958
Yes, Hastings,
we travel with the bonds.

298
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:45,416
I have this confirmed
with M. Vavasour this afternoon.

299
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,291
That's wonderful, Poirot!

300
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,666
What on earth
made you change your mind?

301
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,666
I cannot refuse a lady.

302
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,958
Especially if she's a queen.

303
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,291
I promise you, Poirot, you won't
have a twinge of seasickness.

304
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,666
So you say, mon ami.

305
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,749
But I take the precautions
all the same.

306
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:00,624
$1 million in Liberty Bonds.

307
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,124
New York bound at last,

308
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,333
the Queen Mary
on her maiden voyage.

309
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,124
Tens of thousands of people

310
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,249
have poured into Southampton
to catch a glimpse

311
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,791
of the world's newest
and greatest liner.

312
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,791
But what of the privileged few
who will sail aboard her?

313
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,499
One or two will
hardly remember the occasion,

314
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,166
whilst others are determined
that this will be one trip

315
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,874
that they won't forget.

316
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,374
And here's a familiar face --

317
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,499
Europe's most famous detective,
Hercule Poirot,

318
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,999
hot on the track
of a well-deserved break

319
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,708
and looking forward
to a life on the ocean way.

320
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,624
Another "case" for M. Poirot.

321
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:02,541
There are over 2,000 cases
being loaded safely onboard.

322
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,958
And it's certainly
an arresting sight

323
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,624
as the sailing hour arrives
and the Queen Mary puts to sea.

324
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,874
And now our camera
takes to the air

325
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,791
as Britain's newest liner leaves
the sanctuary of home waters

326
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:22,083
and heads into the Atlantic
Ocean for the first time.

327
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,624
But will she steal
that blue ribbon?

328
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,791
It's currently held
by the Normandie,

329
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,124
with a crossing time
of just four days.

330
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,541
-Bonjour.
-Morning.

331
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,833
Madame.

332
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,666
Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

333
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,291
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

334
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,208
Bonjour, Hastings.

335
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:33,583
Comment ça va?

336
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,833
Oh, I'm terrible.

337
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,458
I tell you, Poirot,
it's not seasickness.

338
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,083
I'm never seasick.

339
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,499
Must have been
that oyster last night.

340
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,374
If you wish, I have some pills.

341
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:51,624
Thank you, Poirot.
I'll be perfectly all right.

342
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,333
Oh, I say, Poirot...

343
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,374
Oui?

344
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,958
There's a young lady
in the cabin next door.

345
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,749
Yes, it is just now
that we have met.

346
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,124
Miss Brooks.

347
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,999
Miranda.

348
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,791
We were supposed to
go swimming together.

349
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,499
If you see her again,
could you tell her I'm...

350
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,958
The bad oyster, no?

351
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,333
Oui.

352
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,749
Yes?

353
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:44,958
Bring it in.

354
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,749
Oh. Good morning.

355
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:57,708
Bonjour, M. Ridgeway.

356
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,166
I thought you were the steward.

357
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,708
No.

358
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,249
You have not yet had
a breakfast.

359
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,624
No.

360
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,999
Actually, I had
a bit of a night of it.

361
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,499
Oui.

362
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:17,124
And the portmanteau?

363
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,499
Oh.

364
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,458
The key's perfectly safe,
Mr. Poirot.

365
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,708
You don't have to worry.

366
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,291
I'll keep the key in my pocket

367
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,749
and lock the cabin door
each time I go out.

368
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,583
If you see the steward, could
you ask him to get a move on?

369
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,541
I'm famished.

370
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,416
Well, hello again.

371
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,124
Ah, mademoiselle.

372
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:49,291
My friend, Captain Hastings,
regrets that he is unable

373
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,624
to swim with you today.

374
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,999
Oh, that's okay.

375
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,416
I was feeling
pretty terrible myself.

376
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,249
I was dancin' until 3:00.

377
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,458
Oh.

378
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,833
And yet you are traveling alone,
Mlle. Brooks?

379
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:02,291
You're never alone
on a ship, Mr. Poirot.

380
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,583
I'll see ya.

381
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:10,541
Mademoiselle, pardon, but...

382
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,541
What is the time?

383
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,666
It's just 9:30.

384
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,166
Thank you.

385
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,083
Ah, Mr. Poirot.

386
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,083
-Good morning.
-Bonjour.

387
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,499
The captain
sends his compliments,

388
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,708
but I'm afraid he won't be
at his table tonight.

389
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:29,749
Oh, there is a problem?

390
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,291
There's been
a patch of fog forecast, sir.

391
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,791
Nothing to concern you,

392
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,333
but the captain will have to
remain on the bridge.

393
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,083
Ah, well. Please to convey
my regrets to the captain.

394
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,958
Yes, sir. Looks as if this may
lose us the blue ribbon.

395
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,624
I suppose
there's always next time.

396
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,499
Oui.

397
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,791
Morning, sir.

398
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,458
Good morning.

399
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,583
Just a little fish for me,
please.

400
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,874
Poached.
With dry toast.

401
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,208
Merci beaucoup.

402
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,416
Mais c'est incroyable, eh?
This ship that is not a ship.

403
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,083
It is, how you say, a marvel.

404
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,291
Yes, Poirot.

405
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:42,333
Ah, but of course my poor
Hastings, he still has the --

406
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:43,833
Food poisoning.

407
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:48,166
Evening, Ridgeway.
Can we count you in tonight?

408
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,374
I'll be there.

409
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,999
See if you can win back
some of that money, eh?

410
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,208
You play the cards?

411
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,624
Yes.

412
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,999
It passes the time.

413
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:03,541
And it's all very friendly.
We just play for a few pounds.

414
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,958
Ah. Merci.

415
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,874
Ah!
Les cervelles au beurre.

416
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:11,916
Oh, what's that?

417
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:16,916
It is the brains of the calf
fried in butter.

418
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:22,874
I think perhaps I'll go
and have another lie-down.

419
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:45,333
Bye! Bye.

420
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,499
Queens high, damn it.

421
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,791
Well...

422
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,041
I'm afraid you're blown,
Ridgeway.

423
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,416
Yes.

424
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,374
I'm sure you'll accept an IOU.

425
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,708
Oh, Miss Brooks.
Miranda.

426
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,541
Why, Captain Hastings.
Can't you sleep?

427
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,166
No, no, I couldn't.

428
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:18,958
I thought I heard...

429
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,666
Someone didn't go overboard
just now, did they?

430
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,124
Only the orchestra.

431
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,583
But they've been going overboard
all night.

432
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:28,249
Yes.
I'm sorry I couldn't join you.

433
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:31,124
Why, I'm sorry
you couldn't make it.

434
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,666
Still, we'll be in New York
in a few hours.

435
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,291
Perhaps we could, um...

436
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,416
Yes, well,
maybe we'll meet again.

437
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,124
Well, then.

438
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,499
Yes.

439
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,916
Miss Brooks?

440
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,916
Good night, Captain Hastings.

441
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,833
Ridgeway?

442
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,916
Captain Hastings.

443
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,416
Ridgeway!

444
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,833
The bonds!

445
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,749
Wait here, please.

446
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,083
Is it really true?
They've gone?

447
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,833
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid so.

448
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,124
But they're an hour
from New York, you said.

449
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,749
They must still be on the ship.

450
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,666
I've cabled them to start
a person-to-person search, sir,

451
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,249
but, uh, it would be easier
if I were there.

452
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,374
They must be found.

453
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,666
If the bonds are sold, it could
bring down the entire bank.

454
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,124
I'm aware of that, sir.

455
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,833
Which is why I must ask you
one question.

456
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,541
Of course. Anything.

457
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:16,749
Do you still have the key
I gave you?

458
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,833
It hasn't left my sight.

459
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,958
Britain's greatest
liner steams into New York

460
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:29,208
at the end
of her first Atlantic crossing

461
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,458
without the blue ribbon

462
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,791
after fog delayed her
for more than 11 hours.

463
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,249
Even so, New York gave
a frenzied welcome

464
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,499
to Britain's queen of the sea.

465
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,624
The crossing was completed
in 4 days, 12 hours, 24 minutes

466
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,541
at an average speed of 29 knots.

467
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,958
And just listen
to that roar of welcome.

468
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,999
I swear to heaven, Mr. Poirot.

469
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,124
I had the key all the time.

470
00:32:59,334 --> 00:33:01,166
And where were you all night,
Mr. Ridgeway?

471
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:02,583
I was playing cards.

472
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,541
I know I should have been here,
but...

473
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,624
I suppose
it's a weakness of mine.

474
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,999
Gambling.

475
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,624
How much did you lose?

476
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,874
About £100.

477
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,083
And the same the night before.

478
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,749
This doesn't look too good
for me, does it?

479
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,291
Leave us, M. Ridgeway.

480
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,958
We shall speak again later.

481
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:28,166
I'll go and make my report
to the captain.

482
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:33,791
I say.
Look at this, Poirot.

483
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,124
It's all cut and scratched
at the back here.

484
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,249
Oui.
This I have examined already.

485
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,291
Almost as if someone
tried to force it but couldn't.

486
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,999
Précisément.

487
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,083
But then they managed
to unlock it anyway.

488
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,416
Hmm.

489
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,333
Curious.
It is very curious.

490
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,833
They waste much, much time
trying to pry it open,

491
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,958
and then, sapristi, they find
they have the key all the time.

492
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:01,291
Unless they wanted to make it
look as if it'd been forced.

493
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,041
Oui. C'est possible.

494
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,666
But then
it must have been Ridgeway.

495
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:07,499
Nobody else had a key.

496
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,208
You are disappointed?

497
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,791
Well, I mean, I think he's
a bit of an ass in many ways,

498
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,333
but I didn't think
he had it in him to --

499
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:16,916
No.
Neither did I, mon ami.

500
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:21,791
-We have to find them, McNeil.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,541
Or the person
who stole them, sir.

502
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:26,791
Quite.

503
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,791
-Mr. Shaw had his key?
-Yes, sir.

504
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,916
-Yes, of course he had.
-Do you have yours, sir?

505
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,333
-What?
-Your key.

506
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,166
-Of course I have.
-May I see it, please, sir?

507
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,999
Really, McNeil!

508
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,583
So I came out here,

509
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,666
went over to the rail here.

510
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,041
Then I heard a splash, which
seemed to come from over there.

511
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,749
And this is where I met Miranda.

512
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:06,166
Mlle. Brooks?

513
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:08,583
Yes.
She came from over there.

514
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,291
Now, the cabin of M. Ridgeway --

515
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,458
It looks out onto this deck,
does it not?

516
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:15,833
Yes.
Yes, it does.

517
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,333
But she was carrying nothing?

518
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,208
No.

519
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,333
If she had taken them,

520
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,749
she could have
thrown them overboard,

521
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,541
and then they could have drifted
into New York.

522
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,708
And then...

523
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,791
perhaps they grew
the little fins and swam ashore.

524
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,374
Yes.

525
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,999
It is a stupid idea.

526
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,416
Au contraire, my dear Hastings.

527
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,166
You are as perceptive as ever.

528
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,041
Wait a minute.

529
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,124
It was here.

530
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:08,374
Mr. Vavasour, do you realize
how serious this matter is?

531
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,208
Of course I do.

532
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,416
This is a matter
for the police now.

533
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,999
-Police?
-Yes, sir.

534
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,458
Your key,
your secretary's fiancé,

535
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,874
and your idea to send the bonds
in the first place.

536
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,416
McNeil, you work for me.

537
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,124
I think you better
come with me, sir.

538
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,958
Down to the Yard.

539
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:33,708
Ah, Mr. Poirot.
Have you made any progress, sir?

540
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,083
We make great steps.

541
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,708
Oh, I wish I could say the same.

542
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,624
This gentleman
is a customs officer, sir.

543
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,624
The name's Franklin, sir.
Tom Franklin.

544
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,374
And may I say
what an honor it is

545
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,166
to shake the hand
of the famous Hercule Poirot.

546
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:47,541
Thank you.

547
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,541
You have begun the search,
M. Franklin?

548
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,874
Yes, sir,
and I have to tell you,

549
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,958
a bent dime
couldn't get past my men.

550
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:54,374
But so far, nothing.

551
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,958
Has Miss Brooks gone ashore yet?

552
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,624
Blond American girl.
Very beautiful.

553
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,374
Sir, there are
over 1,000 passengers onboard.

554
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,541
In any case, officer,
you are too late.

555
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,583
Too late?

556
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,999
The bonds will not be found
on the passengers,

557
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,624
and they are not on this ship.

558
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,041
That's impossible, sir.

559
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,041
They can't have
got off the ship.

560
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,583
I assure you, gentlemen,
that is the case.

561
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:16,999
There is nothing more
for us here.

562
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,874
Hastings, you and I must return
to London at once.

563
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,791
-And Mr. Ridgeway?
-He will be returning with us.

564
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,458
But what about the search,
Mr. Poirot?

565
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,958
Your Mr. McNeil
was pretty insistent.

566
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:33,416
I assure you, officer,
M. McNeil does not belong to me.

567
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:37,458
Mr. McNeil,
where is Mr. Vavasour?

568
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,083
He is at the police station,
Miss Dalgleish.

569
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:41,458
The police? Why?

570
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,916
I'm afraid that is confidential
information, Miss Dalgleish.

571
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,249
He is the general manager
of this bank,

572
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,749
and I am his secretary.

573
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,416
That makes no difference.

574
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,958
I have a right to know.
This is ridiculous.

575
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,458
But let me remind you,
Mr. McNeil.

576
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,916
In a few days,
Mr. Poirot will be back.

577
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,958
I don't see how he can help.

578
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,708
And home again!

579
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:13,041
The Queen Mary returns
to home waters.

580
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,541
And as we circle 'round,

581
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:17,916
another member
of the line passes --

582
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,166
the Berengaria, outward bound --

583
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,458
two great vessels
passing at sea.

584
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:26,624
And now the Queen Mary
heads into Southampton water

585
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,249
and prepares to berth.

586
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:31,208
Many happy returns
to your home waters.

587
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,041
Good to be home, eh, Poirot?

588
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,833
Oh, look.
There's your fiancée.

589
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,291
Officers.

590
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,666
Yes, sir?

591
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,333
Mr. Poirot.

592
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:27,833
I want you to arrest this man

593
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,583
for the theft of $1 million
in the Liberty Bonds.

594
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:31,833
What?!

595
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,208
I say, Poirot.

596
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,624
If you say so, sir.

597
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,291
Come on, you.

598
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:41,708
How could you?!

599
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,208
It looked such a beautiful ship,
Mr. Poirot.

600
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:56,124
It was indeed an experience
most remarkable, Miss Lemon.

601
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:58,916
I'm only sorry it wasn't all
more successful.

602
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,124
But it was a great success.

603
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,458
Not once did I succumb
to the mal de mer.

604
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,416
-Poirot.
-Ah, Hastings, you are ready.

605
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:10,458
We have played the games
long enough, Hastings.

606
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:13,499
it is now time
to settle the scores.

607
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,874
Mr. Poirot!

608
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,124
This is monstrous.

609
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:37,416
I do not know
what happened to my key.

610
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,916
When did you notice it had gone,
M. Vavasour?

611
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,666
Only when McNeil asked for it.

612
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,124
Eh bien. Who, then,
had access to your office?

613
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,749
Myself, my secretary.

614
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,458
One more question,
if you please, monsieur.

615
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:50,749
before the departure
of the Queen Mary,

616
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:53,583
who was it that put the bonds
into the portmanteau?

617
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:54,958
I did. Why?

618
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,916
It is just as I thought,
monsieur.

619
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:59,166
And it tells me
all that I need to know.

620
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,166
Thank you.

621
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,583
Mr. Poirot.

622
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:08,624
Where now?

623
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,291
I don't suppose you'd care
to tell me what's going on.

624
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:36,166
You know, Poirot, you really are
quite impossible.

625
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:40,041
-Why, Hastings?
-You never tell me anything.

626
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,499
I have no idea where we are
or where we're going.

627
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,749
Have patience, mon ami.

628
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,833
Soon all will be made clear.

629
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,249
You!

630
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,291
You must understand,
mademoiselle,

631
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,874
that I am only trying
to help you.

632
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,916
You arrest my fiancé.
McNeil arrests Mr. Vavasour.

633
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,833
You're both as bad
as each other!

634
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,249
Je vous en prie, mademoiselle.
Have patience.

635
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,208
Well?

636
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:15,958
When you came to see me,

637
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,208
it was because you are afraid
of Mr. Ridgeway, no?

638
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,749
I was afraid for him.

639
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,666
No, no, no, mademoiselle.

640
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,458
You knew he was a gambler
most compulsive.

641
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,833
You knew of his debts.

642
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,124
And it was for this reason
that he sold his car.

643
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,499
Yes?

644
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:31,624
I can't deny it, Mr. Poirot.

645
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,999
You seem to know.

646
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,249
And you were also afraid,
were you not,

647
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,708
that if he were entrusted with
the $1 million Liberty Bonds

648
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,249
that he would take them
and disappear.

649
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,916
-I --
-You wished to protect him, mademoiselle.

650
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:46,541
And it is for this reason

651
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,541
that you stole the key
of your employer.

652
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,124
I don't know what you mean!

653
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,999
Please, mademoiselle,
do not try to deceive me!

654
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,249
I know!

655
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,083
You took the key?

656
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,583
Because you wish to save
M. Ridgeway,

657
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,666
you are willing
to let us believe

658
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,291
that the key that opened
the portmanteau

659
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,583
was the key of your employer,
M. Vavasour.

660
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:13,583
But I'm afraid, mademoiselle,
that will not work.

661
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:17,749
Because the keys
have nothing to do with it.

662
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,333
Why have you dragged me here,
Mr. Poirot?

663
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:32,999
I thought it might be
instructive for you, M. McNeil.

664
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:48,708
Is it really true?

665
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,249
Both Mr. Vavasour
and Ridgeway arrested?

666
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,333
Well, one of them
stole the bonds.

667
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,749
Ah, no, no, no.
They stole nothing.

668
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,208
Indeed, there was
nothing to steal.

669
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:00,583
You see, M. McNeil,

670
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,374
the bonds were taken long before
the Queen Mary set sail.

671
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,916
But that's impossible.

672
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,999
We were with the portmanteau
all the time.

673
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,124
No. No, no, no.
Pas du tout, mon ami.

674
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:16,208
M. Vavasour, he put the bonds
into the portmanteau.

675
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,374
And the eyesight of M. Vavasour
is poor.

676
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,041
He told us so himself.

677
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,124
$1 million in Liberty Bonds.

678
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,624
No.

679
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:30,083
He would not have noticed that
the bonds that he was holding

680
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,291
were all forgeries.

681
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,083
-Forgeries?
-Wait a minute.

682
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:38,416
You mean the bonds
on the Queen Mary were fakes?

683
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,958
Exactly that, mon ami.

684
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,791
But why?
What good would that do anyone?

685
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,833
Mr. Shaw has got to rest now.

686
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,666
Ah.
Yes, of course.

687
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,833
Hastings.

688
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,958
Ah, Miss Long, pardon,
but what is the time?

689
00:44:56,584 --> 00:44:58,583
It's 10 past 4:00.

690
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,124
C'est ça.

691
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,249
Ah, mademoiselle...

692
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,208
Pardon, but...

693
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,666
What is the time?

694
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,083
It's just 9:30.

695
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:18,916
On the ship also
I asked you the same question.

696
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:22,749
The disguise was to perfection.

697
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:25,124
But the movement
was exactly the same.

698
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,583
It was the movement
of an experienced nurse

699
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,499
who always wears the watch
on her chest.

700
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:35,958
Miranda?

701
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:37,458
Mlle. Brooks.

702
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:39,833
Or Mlle. Long.

703
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,166
Who traveled with a copy
of one of the keys,

704
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:46,708
who stole the bonds that were
fake, and who disposed of them.

705
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,166
I don't know
what you're talking about.

706
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:50,458
You're talking gibberish.

707
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:51,833
Well, she can't be.

708
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,499
Miranda Brooks
was an absolute stunner.

709
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,208
M. Philip Ridgeway
would take the blame, huh?

710
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,583
M. Ridgeway, with the problems
of his gambling,

711
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:01,124
he would be the obvious suspect.

712
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,333
He would become the,
how do you say, the... scapegoat.

713
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,291
But he did steal them.

714
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,541
He was the one
traveling with them.

715
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,041
Precisely what you were intended
to think, M. McNeil.

716
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,666
That was why it was essential

717
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:13,791
that M. Ridgeway
should be on that boat.

718
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:15,249
No, it was Mlle. Brooks

719
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,708
who tried to kill M. Shaw
with the motorcar.

720
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,416
Oh!

721
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:26,791
It was Mlle. Brooks
who arranged the poisoning.

722
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,833
Miranda planned all that?

723
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,958
All right. Yes.

724
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,041
Here you are.

725
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:43,916
Good Lord.

726
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,541
What are you going to do?
Call the police?

727
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:52,791
All right.
Let's get on with it.

728
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:53,999
All this talk.

729
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,916
No, no, no, no, mademoiselle.

730
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:59,333
One step at a time.

731
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,624
You see, Mlle. Brooks,

732
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:05,499
she now makes
the attempt gallant

733
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,541
to shield her accomplice.

734
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,166
Ridgeway.

735
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:12,333
No.

736
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:14,791
How simple it would have been

737
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,083
for M. Shaw
to remove those bonds

738
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:20,249
that were entrusted to him

739
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,291
if he had taken them
onboard the boat, eh?

740
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:24,083
Too simple.
Too obvious.

741
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,833
The bank would have known
precisely where to look.

742
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:32,041
Are you implying that I was
in some way involved in this?

743
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,499
I was bedridden.

744
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,208
Yes, of course you were,
M. Shaw.

745
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,124
With the poison...

746
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:40,708
that was fake.

747
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,374
As was the attempt to kill you
with the motorcar.

748
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:48,041
It was all part of your plan
to get M. Philip Ridgeway

749
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,916
to take your place on the boat.

750
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,499
But Mr. Shaw still had his key.

751
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,041
Oh, no, no, no, M. McNeil.

752
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,666
He had a copy of his key.

753
00:47:56,042 --> 00:48:00,624
Mlle. Brooks,
she had the real one.

754
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,874
Oh, God.

755
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,541
I'm sorry, Miranda.

756
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,208
You are husband and wife?

757
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,374
No.

758
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:22,041
But we intended to be.

759
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:24,624
I'm sorry.

760
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,249
Don't be.

761
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,416
Prison can't be much worse

762
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:33,208
than 25 years at the
London and Scottish Bank.

763
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,458
All right, Ridgeway.
You're done.

764
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,916
Where's McNeil?

765
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:55,999
I don't see why you had to
have me arrested, though.

766
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,791
Because, M. Ridgeway, I saw

767
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:00,333
the loan sharks waiting for you
at Southampton,

768
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,791
and I thought you'd be safer
in the police cell.

769
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:04,708
Well, that's true, I suppose.

770
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,291
Yeah, and it also allowed
the real culprits

771
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,124
to relax their guard
a little, huh?

772
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,916
I can't tell you how much
we owe you, Mr. Poirot.

773
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,749
I've been promoted
to joint general manager.

774
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,124
I paid off all my debts.

775
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,291
And there aren't going to be
any more.

776
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,458
Thank you for everything.

777
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:24,999
-And goodbye.
-Goodbye.

778
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,999
Au revoir.

779
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,708
We deserve to celebrate
a little, eh, Hastings?

780
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,458
A glass of crème de menthe?

781
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:48,749
Ah.

782
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,208
You scorn the liqueur, Hastings.
Alors.

783
00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:53,958
For you, my friend,
a whiskey, perhaps?

784
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,583
Ah, no.
No, thanks.

785
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:58,791
Hastings.

786
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,958
You are not elated
by our success?

787
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:03,958
Oh, yes, yes.
Very good.

788
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,666
Pas encore Ie mal de mer?

789
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,374
No, I'm fine.

790
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,124
Hastings, we have just completed
a case most successful.

791
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,958
Two men have been released from
the imprisonment most unjust.

792
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,916
You have been privileged
to watch Hercule Poirot

793
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:19,958
at his most brilliant.

794
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:24,041
And on top of this, you have had
the nice ride on the Queen Mary.

795
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,749
Well, I -- I know, Poirot.

796
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,416
I'm sorry.

797
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:30,458
It's Miranda Brooks.

798
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:33,208
Ah, Hastings.

799
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,791
You still have the hankering for
the glamorous young woman, huh?

800
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,583
No, no, no, no.
Not at all. No.

801
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,249
Quite the opposite, in fact.

802
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:44,958
It's just that...

803
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,791
Well, there she was --

804
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:49,291
as you say,
a glamorous young woman.

805
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:52,583
But with a bit of a wig
and a few bits of makeup,

806
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:56,374
she could transform herself
into that dowdy hag of a nurse.

807
00:50:57,667 --> 00:51:00,208
Yes, it was indeed
very well done, Hastings.

808
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:01,874
But...

809
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,499
Well, I mean...

810
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:07,249
If a woman can do that one way,
she can do it the other.

811
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:10,708
Oh, Hastings.

812
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,166
Well...

813
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,291
I mean, then where are you?

814
00:51:19,084 --> 00:51:22,583
At the beginning of wisdom,
mon ami.

815
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,083
Now, that also is something
to celebrate, n'est-ce pas?

816
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,499
Ahh.
