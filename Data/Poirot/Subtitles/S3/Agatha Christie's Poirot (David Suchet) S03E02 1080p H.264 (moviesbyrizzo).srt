1
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,416
Spasibo.

2
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,249
Thank you, Mr. Poirot.
A most discerning choice.

3
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,624
You are most kind, M. Trumper.

4
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,958
You will send the account
to my address, if you please.

5
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,374
Why, yes, of course.

6
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,208
Mr. Poirot, if I may ask,
is there a special occasion?

7
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,999
Oh, yes. A very special
occasion indeed, M. Trumper.

8
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,791
I am about to become
a pink rose.

9
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,124
Yes, you'll be all right.

10
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,374
I thought it might have been

11
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,208
a touch of food poisoning.

12
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,333
Heavens no.

13
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,499
Just normal digestive trouble
for someone your age.

14
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,541
I'll prescribe a powder
to settle the stomach.

15
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,541
And remember,
keep off chocolates, shellfish,

16
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,166
and fried foods.

17
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,666
All your old favorites.

18
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,958
I'll have the powders for
Katrina to collect this evening.

19
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,833
Morning, Fred.

20
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,666
-Morning, Mrs. Delafontaine.
-Lovely day.

21
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,666
What have you got for me, then?

22
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:35,791
Thank you.

23
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,083
-Bye, Fred.
-Bye.

24
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,458
What's the trouble?

25
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,749
Not you.

26
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,291
Where's Katrina?

27
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,416
-Madame?
-Katrina, the post.

28
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,583
Oh. Yes, madame.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,499
Oh. It's you.

30
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:15,458
Only two for Auntie today.
Nothing much to bother her with.

31
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,041
She wants to have them now.

32
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,208
As you wish.

33
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,458
And, mind you,
keep your eyes to yourself.

34
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,666
Poirot?

35
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,708
Time's getting on, you know?
They're waiting for you.

36
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,416
One moment longer, Hastings!

37
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,999
He went straight inside as soon
as he came back from the shops.

38
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,583
Didn't even read his letters.

39
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:49,958
Strange.

40
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,583
Perhaps he's dyeing his hair.

41
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,749
But he's a man.

42
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,333
-What was that, Hastings?
-Oh, uh, nothing.

43
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,833
Eh bien.

44
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,166
Let us put
our best feet forward.

45
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,458
I can't imagine why
you're so keen on coming here.

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,124
You know Mary takes care
of the garden.

47
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,249
Nonetheless,
it does belong to me.

48
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,541
That was unnecessary, Auntie.

49
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,416
As was a certain bill
I received this morning

50
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,124
from the wine merchants.

51
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,208
For spirits.

52
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,791
I've already spoken with Henry
on that subject, Aunt Amelia.

53
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,791
Now, where are we going first?

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,541
I don't know where you're going,

55
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,999
but I have a sudden fancy
to see the roses.

56
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,499
Katrina?

57
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,083
And so it is with a deep honor

58
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,541
that I salute this most
beautiful of flowers,

59
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,041
which shares my own humble name.

60
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,333
Thank you.

61
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,249
Pour moi?

62
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,416
Oh, merci beaucoup.

63
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,458
Mr. Poirot?
Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

64
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,833
M. Poirot?

65
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,916
-This way, Mr. Poirot.
-Thank you.

66
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,124
-Over here, Mr. Poirot.
-M. Poirot.

67
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,999
Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

68
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,999
Of course, I would have expected
you to be a polyantha rose

69
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,624
rather than a hybrid tea.

70
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,791
The scent is much
stronger, you know?

71
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,916
Ah, perhaps, but mine are
magnificent, are they not?

72
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,458
Sunny day.
Amiable company.

73
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,083
A rose that bears his name.
What more could a man have?

74
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,499
-Hay fever.
-The hay fever?

75
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,041
Le rhume des foins?
Pauvre Hastings.

76
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,499
Haven't got a handkerchief I
could borrow, have you, Poirot?

77
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
This one's getting a bit damp.

78
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,999
Unfortunately not.

79
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,624
I still don't think
we should leave them.

80
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,499
Do forget it, Henry.
What are you worried about?

81
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,874
It's just, well, that girl.
She...

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,583
I -- I-I wonder if -- if they
have a bar in this place, mm?

83
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,208
Uh, stop, stop!
Stop, please.

84
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,291
What is it, madame?

85
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,624
I feel quite giddy.
It must be the heat.

86
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,916
Would you get me
a glass of water?

87
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:33,999
Of course.

88
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,249
Leave me here.
I can look at the seeds.

89
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,999
Uh, don't worry.
I shall be quite all right.

90
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,083
Uh, no dawdling, mind.

91
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,416
Oh!
Pardon, madame.

92
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,708
-Please, allow me.
-No. It was my fault.

93
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,499
My -- My attendant has left me
for a few moments.

94
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,374
Thank you.

95
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,624
Oh, it's...
It's Mr. Poirot, surely.

96
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,708
That is correct.

97
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,249
I was quite bedazzled.

98
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,124
It all looks so beautiful,
doesn't it?

99
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,583
Ah. An inspiration.

100
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,916
You have a garden of your own?

101
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,208
One day I hope to retire
to grow the vegetable marrows,

102
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,124
but until then I have only
the window box.

103
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,499
Ah.

104
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,124
T-Then you must take these.
With my compliments.

105
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,208
Oh, no, really, madame.

106
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,999
Miss -- Uh, Miss Barrowby.

107
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,749
Amelia Barrowby?

108
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,374
Please.
Uh, I insist.

109
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,208
I'm sure you'll find them...
quite a revelation.

110
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,499
Oh.

111
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,166
Mademoiselle, you are --
you are most kind.

112
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,416
Thank you.

113
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,833
Spasibo.

114
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,374
Well, where have you
been hiding, girl?

115
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,958
-You've been ages.
-It was very crowded.

116
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,749
Well, what's happening?
You all right?

117
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,499
Yes, yes.
I'm perfectly all right.

118
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,666
There's nothing the matter.
I'm quite well now.

119
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,333
Well, get rid of that water.

120
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,958
And find my husband.

121
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,874
Now, Auntie...

122
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:40,958
Let's see what ideas I can find
for my borders, shall we?

123
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,624
"Fuchsia triphylla
flore coccinea.

124
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,083
Discovered by a French
missionary in 1703."

125
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,874
It is most interesting,
Chief Inspector.

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,333
How is your hay fever, Hastings?

127
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,499
Oh, much better, thanks.

128
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,708
Here you are.

129
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,791
Thank you.
Oh, what's this?

130
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,666
Oh. That is a gift
from an admirer, Hastings.

131
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,499
Mlle. Amelia Barrowby.

132
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,249
Really?

133
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,791
I don't think you'll be getting

134
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,374
many blooms from this lot,
though, Poirot.

135
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,083
It is not of a good variety?

136
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,624
Oh, yes.
One of the best.

137
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,458
Thing is,
there's no seeds in it.

138
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,833
Oh, you're home, madame.

139
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,124
I was worried about the supper.

140
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,333
Don't worry, Lucy.

141
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,833
We haven't forgotten
your night off.

142
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,166
-Who is it this week?
-Ronald Coleman.

143
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,833
Will Miss Katrina be dining?

144
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,083
Yes.

145
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,666
Yes. She just had
a little errand to do.

146
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,458
There we are.
Should do the business.

147
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,166
Thank you.

148
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,666
-Good evening, Miss Lemon.
-Mr. Poirot.

149
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,541
This morning's post
still on your desk.

150
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,083
Oh! Thank you very much,
Miss Lemon.

151
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,541
I just can't understand it.
I never had this trouble before.

152
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,624
I cannot say with certainty
that I have noticed it.

153
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,791
I did have a bit of stick
with an allergy once,

154
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,333
but that was

155
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,249
The nappy rash perhaps?

156
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,458
Is is most intriguing.

157
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,749
You know, what I don't
understand, Poirot,

158
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,374
is why someone
would want to give you

159
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,833
an empty packet of seeds.

160
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:09,124
Perhaps this will be the answer
to your question, Hastings.

161
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,374
A letter
from Mlle. Amelia Barrowby.

162
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,708
What, the same woman?

163
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:17,083
Seems strange she didn't mention
writing it to you.

164
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,958
Yes, indeed.

165
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,874
Thank you.

166
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,374
Listen to this.

167
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,541
"Dear M. Poirot, I hope you will
forgive the form of this letter,

168
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,833
but I have to be very careful.

169
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,083
For some time now
I have been concerned

170
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,999
that something is very wrong
in my household.

171
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,999
When age began
to catch up with me,

172
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,708
my niece Mary and her husband
agreed to take care of me

173
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,499
in return
for a roof over their heads."

174
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,041
It's all there, madame.

175
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,458
Oh, and the soup and fish pie
are on a low light.

176
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,833
Thank you, Lucy.

177
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,083
"Mary runs the house
efficiently enough,

178
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,208
although her husband, Henry,
has one particular weakness

179
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,874
of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

180
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,708
Then, about a year ago,

181
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:15,374
I had cause to engage a young
Russian girl as my companion."

182
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,749
Oh, there you are.

183
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,041
Tell my aunt
we'll have supper directly.

184
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,666
"I am assured
from your description

185
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,708
that you are discretion itself.

186
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:30,458
Even so, I hardly dare set down
the matter that is troubling me.

187
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,166
My worry is
that if word of my suspicions

188
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,624
reach the wrong person, I very
much fear what might happen."

189
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,874
Henry!

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,291
Coming, darling.

191
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,124
"For this reason,

192
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,999
I must continue to behave
as normally as I can...

193
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,999
...in case this person
should take fright."

194
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,874
-Madame.
-Oh.

195
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,833
What does he put
into these things?

196
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,208
Oh!

197
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:13,541
For what we are
about to receive,

198
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,749
may the Lord make us
truly thankful.

199
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,708
"If you will help me,

200
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:24,041
perhaps you would call and speak
with me at the above address

201
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,458
as soon as possible.

202
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:30,624
Yours very truly,
Amelia Barrowby."

203
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,249
Curious.

204
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,791
All sounds a bit dotty
if you ask me.

205
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,208
Why didn't she just tell you
about it when she met you?

206
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,999
The old lady is unaccompanied
for the moment.

207
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,791
She's frightened
she may be discovered.

208
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,958
She passes to me
a harmless packet.

209
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,999
What does it mean?

210
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,999
Probably has
an active imagination.

211
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,124
Lot of old dears do.

212
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:09,166
"Rosebank, Charman's Green."

213
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,458
Where is that?

214
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,333
South.
Borders of Surrey.

215
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,416
Green fields, certainly.

216
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,083
Not sure
I like the sound of that.

217
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,458
Eh bien.

218
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,208
At the first thing tomorrow,
Miss Lemon,

219
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,666
I would like you to accompany me

220
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,874
on a visit
to Mlle. Amelia Barrowby.

221
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,916
If you wish, Mr. Poirot.

222
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,916
Oh!

223
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,708
Aah! Madame! Please!

224
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,041
Please, what is it?

225
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,583
Get away from her!

226
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,374
-Leave her alone!
-Get away!

227
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,166
-She's so sick.
-Oh, my God.

228
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,624
-Get the doctor.
-What?

229
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,958
The doctor, you idiot.
Quickly!

230
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,583
No, I'm afraid she's not here.

231
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,499
-Is Mr. Poirot?
-No, he's not here either.

232
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,166
They've gone down
to Charman's Green.

233
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,624
I'm sort of holding the fort,
as I can't risk the pollen.

234
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,958
When's she going to settle
the account?

235
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:51,416
-Pardon?
-She has to settle the account!

236
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:52,833
Oh.

237
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,416
Well, I'm sure
she meant to pay it.

238
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,708
Hang on. I'll dig out the bill
and have a look.

239
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,458
I'll just be a moment,
Mr. Trumper.

240
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:58,458
Perhaps you would have
the goodness to wait.

241
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,208
We'll be requiring a receipt
upon paying.

242
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,083
A receipt?

243
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,624
I wonder...

244
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,833
What is it, Mr. Poirot?

245
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,624
I'm not certain, Miss Lemon.

246
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,833
Come.

247
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,749
A most orderly garden,
is it not?

248
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,791
Very neat.

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,749
They should have finished
that edging, though.

250
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:37,958
Hmm.

251
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:54,791
Ah!

252
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,499
This is like your English
nursery rhyme, Miss Lemon.

253
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,749
"Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
how does your garden grow?

254
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,708
With silver bells --"

255
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,416
Oh. Pardon.

256
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,708
I fear that this has been
dropped in your garden.

257
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,166
That's where it got to.

258
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,958
Must have been dropped,
what with...

259
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,333
-Thank you, sir.
-Je vous en prie.

260
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,916
Is Mlle. Barrowby at home?

261
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,874
Oh, sir!

262
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,916
Didn't you know?

263
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,541
It was last night she...

264
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,916
I'm afraid she died, sir.

265
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,166
-If you just wait here, sir.
-Thank you so much.

266
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,916
You are a lawyer?

267
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,874
Why should I be a lawyer,
mademoiselle?

268
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,208
I thought perhaps
you have come to say

269
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,958
she did not know
what she was doing.

270
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:06,958
That is not right.

271
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:10,583
She wrote it down,
and so shall it be.

272
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,124
Mr. Poirot, I'm so sorry.

273
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,708
May I introduce myself?
Mary Delafontaine.

274
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,791
Madame.

275
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,166
This is my husband.

276
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,208
-How do you do?
-Monsieur.

277
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,249
Miss Barrowby was my aunt.

278
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,499
Thank you.

279
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:42,708
I very much regret, madame, that
I intrude on your bereavement.

280
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,416
Oh, please be reassured.

281
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,041
It, uh --
It was rather unexpected.

282
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,166
Hercule Poirot.

283
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,166
-You're that detective chap.
-Monsieur.

284
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,791
Of course.
The new rose.

285
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,374
I saw you at the flower show.

286
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,749
What brings you to our house?

287
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,499
Oh, forgive me, madame.

288
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,499
Mlle. Barrowby
had written to me a letter,

289
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,041
and she wished to consult me
on a certain matter.

290
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,958
What matter?

291
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,916
That was of
a private nature, madame.

292
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,624
Didn't mention Russkies,
did she?

293
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,166
Pardon? Russkies?

294
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,041
Bolshies.
The red menace.

295
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,624
Henry, please.

296
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,874
Sorry.
I -- I just thought...

297
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,374
Mr. Poirot, couldn't you tell us
a little more?

298
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,083
Uh...

299
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,249
Well, Mr. Poirot?

300
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,874
At the present moment, madame, I
regret that I must say nothing.

301
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,291
Forgive me.
I will show myself out.

302
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,999
Au revoir.
Madame. Monsieur.

303
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,666
There is a mouse in this hole,
Miss Lemon.

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,208
What must a cat do now?

305
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,833
I'm sure I don't know
what that means, Mr. Poirot.

306
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,499
Where to now, sir?

307
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:18,916
You tell me...

308
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,958
...Chief Inspector.

309
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,041
I noticed at once that your men,

310
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,416
they were making
the surveillance.

311
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,124
Family doctor put us up
to the whole thing.

312
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,166
When I phoned Captain Hastings,

313
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,583
he told me you were
on your way here.

314
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:38,166
I trust you didn't blow
the gaffe to the Delafontaines.

315
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,416
As far as they're concerned,

316
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,166
we're just waiting
for the postmortem.

317
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,541
So you suspect as I do?

318
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,833
We're doing
our own little test right now.

319
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,708
Down at the mortuary.

320
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,999
Perhaps you'd rather wait
in the taxi, Miss Lemon.

321
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,124
No, thank you.

322
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,999
I did help in the hospital
morgue during the war.

323
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:58,333
More filing, Miss Lemon?

324
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:59,791
Mr. Poirot!

325
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,249
There's no doubt whatsoever.

326
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:08,333
-Strychnine.
-A very large dose.

327
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,499
Which would
have to be administered

328
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,791
very shortly before death.

329
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,458
Precisely.

330
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,499
Right. We'd better find out
what they all had for dinner.

331
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,666
Ah. Miss Lemon.

332
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,374
Artichoke soup --
served from a tureen --

333
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,666
fish pie, and apple tart.

334
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,791
I was chatting to the maid.

335
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,833
She had some time off
to see a film.

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,833
All four of them
ate the same thing.

337
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,541
Excellent, Miss Lemon.

338
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,083
Can't have been in the
food, then, if they all had it.

339
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,874
Must have slipped it
to the old girl separately.

340
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,333
No, no, Chief Inspector.
That cannot be.

341
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,666
Eh?

342
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:48,333
He's right.
Strychnine's as bitter as gall.

343
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,499
You can taste it in a solution
of one in a thousand.

344
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,624
-Coffee.
-She never drank it.

345
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,416
Well, I'm hanged if I can see
how anyone did it.

346
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,791
Nevertheless, Chief Inspector,

347
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,708
someone in that household
is a cold-blooded poisoner.

348
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,583
I feared it might be this.

349
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,874
I've seen something like it
once before in my old practice.

350
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,916
Oh?

351
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:49,833
Rich old biddy takes
in her penniless relatives.

352
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,458
Holds the purse strings.

353
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:54,708
The temptation is to speed up
the natural process and collect.

354
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:56,083
So the Delafontaines,

355
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,374
they were dependent on the money
of Mlle. Barrowby?

356
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,583
Totally.
Hadn't a bean of their own.

357
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:04,124
Dabbled in stocks and shares,
I'm afraid.

358
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,208
Crash hit them
as badly as any of us.

359
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,583
And they're
her only living relatives.

360
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,124
Yes.

361
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,791
Certain to inherit.

362
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:22,083
Substantial private income,
by all accounts.

363
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,708
Excuse me, M. le Docteur.

364
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,166
Was Mlle. Barrowby
taking the medicine of any kind?

365
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,374
Not much we can do for her
at that age.

366
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,499
Just a cachet before meals
to aid the digestion.

367
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,166
Ah.

368
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,541
Oh, no. It couldn't have been
her powders.

369
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,749
Katrina guarded those
like a demon.

370
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,041
Well, perhaps she slipped in
the poison.

371
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,416
Why?

372
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,708
Katrina wouldn't poison
her mistress.

373
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,583
Much better keep her alive
and remain employed.

374
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,083
"She wrote it down,
and so shall it be."

375
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:56,708
She what?

376
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,624
Possibly nothing.

377
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,749
Well, one thing's for sure --

378
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,624
The Delafontaines
have got to be told

379
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,041
that this is now
a murder investigation.

380
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:08,291
Coming, Poirot?

381
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,083
No, no. Not for the present,
Chief Inspector.

382
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:12,458
Doctor.

383
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:18,291
Tell me, Dr. Sims, did
Mlle. Barrowby have a solicitor?

384
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,416
I understand the problem,

385
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:40,541
but I'm not due to read the will
until next Saturday.

386
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:46,833
The girl said to me, "She wrote
it down, and so shall it be."

387
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,999
Have you any idea
what she meant by that?

388
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,333
I'm afraid I'm bound
to remain silent.

389
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,499
M. Harrison, please forgive me.

390
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,291
I am not asking you to break
the confidentiality of a client.

391
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,124
However, it is unfortunate

392
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,666
that it suits the purposes
of a murderer.

393
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,999
Numbers 3, 9, and 14, please.

394
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:28,208
It's rather
a difficult decision, this one.

395
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:37,416
These two
are well known to everyone.

396
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,666
The mare and the gelding.

397
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,499
Solid, reliable.

398
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,166
And then there's this.

399
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,874
A young filly.
Foreign blood stock.

400
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:49,791
Unconventional.

401
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:52,083
A new arrival
in a close-knit stable.

402
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,416
And which will win the prize?

403
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,416
The new arrival wins it.

404
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,708
M. Harrison, I thank you.

405
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,083
Justice has been
seen to be done.

406
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,874
Miss Lemon.

407
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,583
I'll have you pounding
the beat again for two pennies.

408
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:41,291
I've never known
a more dozy pair of layabouts.

409
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:42,791
Chief Inspector?

410
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,333
Poirot.

411
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:47,708
I bring the bad news.

412
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,833
Well, I've had my fair share
of that for today.

413
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,583
It is not the Delafontaines

414
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,958
who inherit the money
of Mlle. Barrowby.

415
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:55,958
It is the Russian girl,
Katrina Reiger,

416
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:58,916
and she was aware of the fact
for all of the time.

417
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,749
You hear that?

418
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,249
If there wasn't a lady present,

419
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,249
your ears
would be burning so much

420
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,416
they'd boil
what's left of your brains.

421
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:10,541
Why?
What has happened?

422
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,166
They've only gone and let her
slip out of the place!

423
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,291
Katrina Reiger has gone missing.

424
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,666
Murder?

425
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,041
Well, it's so unthinkable.

426
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,041
I just didn't...

427
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,166
Henry, I should have listened
to you.

428
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,208
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,874
I never did trust that girl.

430
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:33,666
Oh.

431
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,999
I think I feel faint.

432
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,791
Easy, old thing.

433
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,416
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,458
A lie-down
would be the best idea.

435
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,458
It's been a shock for us all.

436
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,999
A little bit of Russia in our
green and pleasant land, eh?

437
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,708
Most interesting.

438
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,291
Tell me, Chief Inspector,

439
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,874
do you know which is
this particular saint?

440
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:05,166
All these foreign, bearded types
look the same to me.

441
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,083
Does it matter?

442
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,208
Possibly not.

443
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,541
Let us rejoin the others.

444
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,749
I've given her a mild sedative.

445
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,916
-Thank you, Doctor.
-It's been quite an experience.

446
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,166
Ah. Mr. Poirot.
Chief Inspector.

447
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,333
M. le Docteur.

448
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,666
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

449
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,041
Never liked that girl.
Secretive.

450
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,124
You suspected
that Mlle. Barrowby

451
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,499
had left her everything?

452
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,624
Oh, no, not for sure.
But there was always the threat.

453
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,124
Sir?

454
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,916
In the Russian box.

455
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,874
Hmm.

456
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,249
Looks like strychnine to me,
all right.

457
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,541
If I'm any judge,

458
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:03,833
all Miss Reiger
will be collecting

459
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,208
is a trip to the Old Bailey.

460
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,874
If that is her name.

461
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:08,999
What do you mean?

462
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,541
Communist agitator.

463
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:11,999
Spreads trouble, raises money,

464
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,374
working for the revolution
in England.

465
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,416
Oh, come off it, sir.
That's Boy's Own Paper stuff.

466
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,624
No, no, no, no, no,
Chief Inspector Japp.

467
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,499
I fear that M. Delafontaine
is quite right.

468
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,249
Well, check again.

469
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,041
There is no possibility of error
in the state information files.

470
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,999
She must be registered.

471
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,124
She's been living here
three years.

472
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,999
Comrade Stalin makes
no provision for mistakes.

473
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:43,291
We know no one
called Katrina Reiger.

474
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:48,791
Thank you.
You've been a great help.

475
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,541
One more thing, monsieur.

476
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:01,833
What was it that Marx called
"the opiate of the masses"?

477
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,333
Popular fiction, comrade.

478
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:06,708
Ah, yes, of course.

479
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,416
Thank you.

480
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,916
Looks like
you could be right, Poirot.

481
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,041
She must be
one of those agitators.

482
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,833
Why else would they deny
all knowledge of her?

483
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,708
Probably back in Russia by now.

484
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,041
I do not think
that she would enjoy that.

485
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,374
She's a red, isn't she?

486
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,374
I hardly think so,
Chief Inspector.

487
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,291
Not with an image of the late
czar on her dressing table.

488
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,458
-But you said --
-That Mr. Delafontaine is right?

489
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:41,833
Oh, yes.

490
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,583
Reiger is not her real name.

491
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,083
Well, what do we do now?

492
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,374
If I were you, Chief Inspector,

493
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,083
I would look for
the Russian church in London.

494
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,624
The opiate of the masses
is religion,

495
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,833
as the young man fully knows.

496
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,041
And now...

497
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,374
It is time for my tea time,
Miss Lemon.

498
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,458
Chief Inspector.

499
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,124
Mr. Trumper's phoned
three or four times.

500
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,749
He's really very upset.

501
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:22,749
Perhaps I should send
the cash around by messenger.

502
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,874
Five guineas
will settle the account.

503
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,874
Certainly not, Captain Hastings.
Just ignore it.

504
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,583
I'll have words with him
when I return.

505
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:31,833
Well, yes, but --

506
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,041
And on no account
disturb the files.

507
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:36,708
Bye for the moment.

508
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:11,374
Miss Lemon, I want you to figure
to yourself a little history.

509
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,958
Mr. Poirot?

510
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,666
You are a Russian girl.

511
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,374
Yes.

512
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,166
You are employed
as a nurse companion

513
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,208
to an old lady
who is very demanding.

514
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,249
Yes.

515
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,458
And she takes a liking to you,
this old lady,

516
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,124
and she decides to leave to you
all her money.

517
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,499
She tells you so.

518
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:31,999
But there is one worry.

519
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,666
You have not been entirely
honest about your background.

520
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,041
Then disaster.

521
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,583
You suspect that she has
called upon the services

522
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,124
of a famous detective.

523
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,124
You act swiftly.

524
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:46,708
And before he arrives,
this detective,

525
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,541
the old lady is dead
and the money is yours.

526
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,874
Does this sound
to you reasonable?

527
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,791
I'm rather afraid it does.

528
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,583
I agree.

529
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,291
If only we could be sure

530
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:06,499
of what Mlle. Barrowby
was suspicious of.

531
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,874
If only she could have left us
more of a clue.

532
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,791
Are you sure she didn't slip
something into the seed packet?

533
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,249
No.

534
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,541
Of course.

535
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,541
What a simpleton I have become.

536
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:38,958
Ah, Poirot.
Here it is.

537
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,791
Russian church.
Not a sparrow's hop from here.

538
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,583
Excellent.
But first...

539
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:46,374
If you please, Miss Lemon --
Do you have two pennies?

540
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,791
For a tip, Mr. Poirot?

541
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,374
For the telephone, Miss Lemon.

542
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,541
Bonjour, Mlle. Reiger.

543
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,666
No, mademoiselle!

544
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,416
Be not alarmed.

545
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,666
This is sanctuary.

546
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,999
You are safe here.

547
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,791
I want only to know the truth.

548
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,124
Why did you run away?

549
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,666
I know what you all think --
It was I who poisoned her.

550
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,333
Oh, yes, I know the signs.
I have seen it in Russia.

551
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,958
When Stalin's men came.

552
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,416
Your family was persecuted
because of their position,

553
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,333
so you fled secretly to England.

554
00:38:58,417 --> 00:38:59,666
What do you care?

555
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,374
Like them,
you wish me to be penniless.

556
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,666
This I must know, mademoiselle.

557
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:09,249
Did no one touch the medication
but you?

558
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,874
I would rather have died.

559
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,583
And Mlle. Barrowby had for
her dinner only what we know?

560
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,333
Of course.
Or somebody would have noticed.

561
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:21,208
It must have been a great trial
for a girl like you

562
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,749
to work for another --

563
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,083
fetch this, carry that --

564
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:29,791
when once you had servants
of your own.

565
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:33,333
I am a Regimirov.

566
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:40,041
I am not afraid of work.

567
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,666
And are you afraid of the noose?

568
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,666
It was on the seed packet
all the time.

569
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,833
"Catherine the Great."
Or in Russian, "Katrina."

570
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,083
I realized on the way over.

571
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,999
Here he comes.

572
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,499
Ah.

573
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,416
I will go with you now.

574
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,083
Take her and charge her.

575
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,749
Well, at least she came quietly.

576
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,791
There's a nice, tidy end
to the whole business.

577
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,666
I do not think so,
Chief Inspector.

578
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,791
Come, Miss Lemon.

579
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,541
Oh, no.

580
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:13,208
Hello, Poirot.
Mr. Japp, Miss Lemon.

581
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:18,374
How goes the sneezing, Hastings?

582
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,458
Oh, dear.

583
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,124
Well, this package
arrived for you.

584
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,916
Seems to be full of old letters.

585
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,499
Ah. Thank you.

586
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,541
Thank you.

587
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,124
Now, look here, Poirot.

588
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,916
I can't for the life of me
see what's bothering you.

589
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:39,208
The girl saw you talking
to the old biddy.

590
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:40,458
She knew something was up.

591
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,083
She had the motive, and she had
the only opportunity.

592
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,124
We know without a doubt
who did it.

593
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,208
Oh, yes.
We know that, I think.

594
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,249
What are these, Poirot?

595
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,291
Well, these, Hastings,
are the routine letters

596
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:54,499
that Mlle. Barrowby
wrote to her accountant.

597
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,041
And this is the letter
that she wrote to me.

598
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,041
Aha.

599
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,624
Now, if you look very carefully,
Hastings,

600
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,583
you will note in the handwriting

601
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:06,666
the important
but subtle difference.

602
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,041
I see.

603
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,083
So Katrina
swapped her mistress' letter

604
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,916
with the one she wrote herself.

605
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,208
Oh, Hastings.

606
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,958
How I have missed
your powers of deduction.

607
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:21,249
No.

608
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,708
The one thing that bothers me
is the proof of how it was done.

609
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,624
We have that.

610
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,333
Don't we?

611
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,916
Captain Hastings!

612
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,874
What... is... this?!

613
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,708
Ah. Yes.

614
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:39,208
I was going to explain
about that.

615
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,249
I told you not to pay
this account!

616
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:45,333
Well, Mr. Trumper
was very persistent.

617
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,624
But you don't know tradesmen.

618
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,958
If you pay in cash,
they'll never forget you.

619
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,291
They'll think your checks
aren't good.

620
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,208
Of course!

621
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:00,083
We will make another visit
to Charman's Green.

622
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:01,374
You also, Miss Lemon.

623
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,958
-I, Mr. Poirot?
-Oh, yes.

624
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:07,374
I want you to pay a visit
to a fishmonger.

625
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,374
you have recovered
from the shock now?

626
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,749
Thank you, yes.

627
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,041
it's all been rather an ordeal.

628
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:28,833
-Ah.
-Good afternoon.

629
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,083
Good afternoon.

630
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:32,249
M. le Docteur.
Madame. Monsieur.

631
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:36,249
Mr. Poirot.
What a pleasant surprise.

632
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,916
Now I can thank you for all
you've done behind the scenes.

633
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:41,458
Je vous en prie, madame.

634
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,291
Merci, mademoiselle.

635
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,374
-Please, do sit down.
-Thank you, monsieur.

636
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,791
-Pleasure.
-Ah.

637
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,499
An unpleasant business, eh?

638
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:51,958
And not a simple one.

639
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:55,041
Now that it's all over,

640
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,041
perhaps you'll take us
into your confidence.

641
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,041
Yes.
What was it? A Bolshie plot?

642
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:05,041
They played their part, but no.

643
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,083
As you know, Mlle. Barrowby
had written to me.

644
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,541
But she dared not to
confide to me her exact worries

645
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,833
in case that letter,
it had been intercepted.

646
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,916
But then, you know,
wonder upon wonders,

647
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,708
she catches sight of me
at the flower show,

648
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:21,041
so she contrives
the brief meeting...

649
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,916
-Oh!
-Oh! Pardon, madame.

650
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,208
Please, allow me.
No, no, no.

651
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:25,583
No, it was my fault.

652
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:28,541
...thinking that I had
already read her letter.

653
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,791
She spoke to you?

654
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,624
Oh, yes. But you see, madame,
here was her problem.

655
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,333
She might be watched.
She might be overheard.

656
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:39,208
So she passes to me
an innocent packet

657
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:43,124
which is a clue
to that which she suspects.

658
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,083
-A clue?
-Yes.

659
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,791
In fact, M. le Docteur,
it was something that you said

660
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:53,708
that finally made it clear to me
the significance of the packet.

661
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,499
Stocks!

662
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:02,999
I telephoned to the accountant
of Mlle. Barrowby in the city,

663
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,249
who confirmed
that during the recent months,

664
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,416
Mlle. Barrowby had been moving
into the ventures

665
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,791
of most high risk,

666
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:12,041
as these letters of instruction
to her broker prove.

667
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:16,458
Except these letters, they were
not written by Mlle. Barrowby.

668
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,249
Oh, no.

669
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,916
They are the forgeries
of the most skillful.

670
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:23,458
Damnable Bolshie.

671
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:25,999
Right under our very noses.

672
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,499
Ah, yes.

673
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:30,583
M. Delafontaine.

674
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:33,333
You attempt to confuse me

675
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,999
with your ridiculous stories
about spies.

676
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,374
Mlle. Reiger is a Russian
aristocrat, not a Communist.

677
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:42,916
In truth, M. Delafontaine,

678
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:46,124
you have been trying to conceal
a most devious murder!

679
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,708
Sorry.

680
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,874
Mr. Poirot,
is this melodrama essential?

681
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,416
When I first came here,
M. le Docteur,

682
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,666
this beautiful garden,

683
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:02,791
it reminded me of your famous
English nursery rhyme.

684
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:06,791
"Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
how does your garden grow?

685
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,291
With the silver bells
and the cockleshells

686
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:14,708
and the pretty maids
all in a row."

687
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,749
Except they were
not cockleshells

688
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,208
that were used in the border
of the garden.

689
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:23,041
They were oyster shells.

690
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:27,541
The favorite but forbidden treat
of your aunt, were they not?

691
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:30,583
Mme. Delafontaine.

692
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,249
You also saw me
at the flower show,

693
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,833
but you could not risk
the discovery that for some time

694
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,166
you had once again been
speculating with the stocks --

695
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:41,624
only on this occasion, madame,
with the money of your aunt.

696
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:45,083
I believe you are also
speculating, Mr. Poirot.

697
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:47,999
Where is your proof?

698
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,916
Ah, yes, madame.
The proof.

699
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,874
I'm afraid the fishmonger
remembers you

700
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,333
buying the oysters on that day.

701
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,874
You see, madame, you were
foolish enough to pay cash.

702
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,541
He's got us, Mary.

703
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,249
You idiot!

704
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:18,249
Mary! Mary!

705
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:28,791
Darling, now, please.

706
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:33,249
There is no escape, madame.

707
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:36,208
That miserable Russian rat!

708
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,041
She was going to get everything!

709
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,624
Including my garden!
My garden!

710
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,541
So you would plant
the poison in her room

711
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,708
and send her to her death?

712
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:50,583
What did it matter?
She's a little fool!

713
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:53,958
Keep back!

714
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,166
Oh, yes.

715
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:59,791
That jelly of a husband of mine
tried to talk me out of it.

716
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:03,458
But it was so deliciously easy.

717
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:06,999
Auntie always had a weakness
for oysters,

718
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,208
but the doctor disapproved.

719
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:12,083
It was simple to produce them
as a secret treat.

720
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,791
She swallowed them so quickly,

721
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,791
she never noticed
the taste of the strychnine.

722
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:19,666
The only problem
was to dispose of the shells

723
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,374
so Lucy wouldn't notice.

724
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,999
And edging on the flower bed
was perfect.

725
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:27,749
It also provided a resting place
for the bell,

726
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:30,124
always ringing over and over.

727
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,791
And so it is over, madame!

728
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,291
Not quite!

729
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:38,291
No, madame!
No!

730
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:46,249
Whiskey?

731
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:52,124
Sorry, darling.

732
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:54,958
You fool!

733
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:58,541
You've condemned me
to the gallows!

734
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:03,666
Mr. Delafontaine.

735
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,666
Bravo, mademoiselle.

736
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:17,874
You are indeed
as brave as you claim.

737
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:19,583
And now you are free.

738
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:21,583
Free?

739
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,583
Your young friend.
He is waiting.

740
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:38,666
Thank you, M. Poirot,
for not betraying us.

741
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:43,166
One day we shall be truly free.

742
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,374
Where to, miss?

743
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,666
Take us to...

744
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,958
...the Ritz.

745
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,749
Swipe me.
She's the Queen of Sheba.

746
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,499
Good evening, Hastings.

747
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:22,874
Hello there, all.

748
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,416
Captain Hastings,
what are you doing?

749
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:28,166
All that pollen.

750
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,666
No, no. It's all right.
I'm as right as ninepence.

751
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,458
-It wasn't hay fever after all.
-Certainly sounded like it.

752
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:35,999
No, you remember I said
I had an allergy once before?

753
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,749
Well, I remembered what it was.

754
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,208
An aunt of mine was fond of

755
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:40,958
a particular
French lady's perfume.

756
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:41,833
Eh?

757
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:44,416
Every time I went near her
or in a room where she'd been,

758
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,624
I couldn't stop sneezing.

759
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,749
I'm afraid, Miss Lemon, you must
use a different perfume.

760
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,208
I never wear perfume to work,
Mr. Poirot.

761
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,916
-You don't?
-It would be most inappropriate.

762
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,708
Well, somebody's
wearing perfume.

763
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,083
I can smell it.

764
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:02,374
Perhaps it is
the flowers, my friend.

765
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,499
No.
No, it's different.

766
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,916
It's over here somewhere.

767
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,583
Poirot!
What on earth are you wearing?

768
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,624
Well, I do not know
what you mean, Hastings.

769
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,416
You're wearing scent.

770
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,124
Nonsense, Hastings.

771
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,708
I am wearing
a discreet, manly cologne

772
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,916
that I purchased
from M. Trumper.

773
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,458
For five guineas.

774
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,083
Five guineas?

775
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,499
I thought it was
all his haircuts for a year.

776
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,874
That is enough!

777
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,041
The office of Poirot
is closed for business!

778
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,374
Miss Lemon,
cover up your typewriter.

779
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,916
Good day to you,
Chief Inspector Japp.

780
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,208
And, Hastings,
will you please go home

781
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,458
and nurse
your unfortunate affliction?
