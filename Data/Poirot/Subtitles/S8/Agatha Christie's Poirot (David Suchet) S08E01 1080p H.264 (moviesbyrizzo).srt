in the letters

she had sent unto them

They carried Naboth forth

.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,050
Our reading today
was the story of Jezebel,

whose name has come to stand
for the wickedness of women.

17

A woman who was shallow
and profane
.

19
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,660
It was she who persuaded
her husband, Ahab,

to kill Naboth,

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,420

Was she the girl

who found the body

23
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,220
VICAR: And of Jezebel
also spoke the Lord saying:

"The dogs shall eat Jezebel
by the wall of Jezreel."

25

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,860

This is the God

MAN: The body
of Alice Corrigan

35
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
was discovered at the site
known as Blackridge Woods

36
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,020
at exactly 10:15 A.M.
by Miss Jane Martindale
,

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,900
who was on a cyding holiday
in the area,

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,240
and who made a note
of the time.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,490
It was her opinion
that the woman had been dead

40
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,280
only a short while --

41
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,290
a view shared by the police
surgeon who examined the body

42
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,870
where it had been found
at half past 11:00.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,420
We have several witnesses
who have attested

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,750
that the dead woman's fiancé

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,090
was on the train from London
,

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,340
and this didn't
arrive until 10:20.

48
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,640
This inquest therefore
returns a verdict of murder

49
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,140
by person or persons unknown.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,630
You look very smart,
Mr. Poirot.

51
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
You think so, Miss Lemon?

52
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,510
It is true.

53
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,720
But for the grand dinner
of Captain Hastings,

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,260
it is necessary to make
the impression, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

The opening night of his
new Argentinean restaurant!

56
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,020
It will be a new experience,
this cuisine of the Argentine.

57
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,270
I didn't know the Argentine
had a cuisine
.

58

Miss Lemon, are you sure you
will not be able to join us?

59
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,070
I'm way behind with
my filing, Mr. Poirot.

Something wrong, Mr. Poirot?

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,420
Yes.
,?
What do you think Miss Lemon

65
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,080
This jacket seems to have
shrunk a little, no?

Here and here
.

67
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,510
I hardly think so
.

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,550
Maybe you've put
on a little weight.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,970
I...
No.

70
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,260
No, no, Miss Lemon.

71
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,720
That is not possible.

72
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,350
Remind me if you please to
,,
speak to my deaners tomorrow.

73

You have called for the taxi

74

76
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,990

Very kind of you to invite me

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,220
On the contrary,
Chief Inspector,

81
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,810
it's very good of you to come
.

82
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,480
This is a new venture for me,
and to be honest
,

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
I need all the reassurance
I can get.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,980
You have invested a great deal

85

of your capital in
this restaurant, Hastings?

86
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,650
A fair amount, yes.

87
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,900
Which is why it means a lot
to me that you're here

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,490
on opening night, Poirot.

89
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,110
Having celebrity never hurts.

90

Ah...
But I believe I'm not

here tonight, Hastings.

92

Oh, indeed, no.
You see that girl there?

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,460
Kenneth MarshaII,

346
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,670
Have you met him?

347
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,510
We've seen him.

348
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,140
He and I were what you might
caII "childhood sweethearts."

349
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,760
A Iong, Iong time ago.

350
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,970
Now we're just good friends
.
He suggested I come down.

351
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Do you know his wife?

352
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,980
His first wife Linda
,.

353
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,270
A sweet girI.

354
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,270
She died a few years ago
of typhoid
.

355
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,020
Very sad
.

356
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm afraid I'm not
so dose to ArIena.

357
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,110
Thank you.

358
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,070
The second Madame MarshaII
.

359
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,320
I'm sorry?

360
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,370
Pardon you were speaking
,

361
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,370
of Madame ArIena MarshaII
.

362
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Yes, weII...what can I say?

363
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,550
She treats him dreadfuIIy
.

364
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,510
And she's up to her eyes
in scandaI
.

365
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,430
I mean, that business
with Erskine,

366
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,470
for a start.

367
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,430
But this is a name
I do not know
.

368
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,720
DARNLEY: Sir Roger Erskine.

369
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,310
ElderIy unattached
,,
very, very rich.

370
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,270
He's foIIowing her around town
Iike a puppy and then suddenIy
,,

371
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,280
dropped dead
,
Ieft her his entire fortune.

372
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,070
Oh.

373
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,570
So Madame MarshaII is a woman
,
of weaIth in her own right?

374
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,990
Mm-hmm.

375
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,450
Maybe that's why Kenneth's
married her
.

376
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
But I teII you this,
Mr. Poirot.

377
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,000
That woman is troubIe.

378
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,080
You wait and see
.

379
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,670
[Both Iaughing]

380
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,500
Don't spIash me!
[Screams]

381
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,600
MarveIous view,
don't you think?

382
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,730
Yes indeed
,.

383
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,270
Miss Brewster.
EmiIy Brewster.

384
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,860
MademoiseIIe
.

385
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,990
And I know who you are
.
You're HercuIe Poirot.

386
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,570
POIROT: <i>Oui.</i>

387
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,990
And you must be
Captain Hastings.

388
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,530
That's right.

389
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,870
Word's got around
that you were here.

390
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,290
Now don't teII me
,.

391
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,250
There's been
a gruesome murder somewhere
,

392
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,500
and you think there's
a homicidaI maniac

393
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,120
Iurking among the hoteI guests!

394
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,090
No no mademoiseIIe
,,.
I am here for my heaIth.

395
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,550
How disappointing
.

396
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,840
Of course if you did
,
want to commit a murder
,

397
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,340
this would be
the perfect pIace.

398
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,050
You beIieve so mademoiseIIe
,?

399
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,010
EMILY:
PeopIe away from home.

400
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,220
Everyone's got
a reason to be here.

401
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,230
But if you secretIy wanted
to get dose to someone

402
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,440
because you wanted
to finish them off,

403
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,060
this is where you'd come
.

404
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,570
But teII me mademoiseIIe
,,
who would be the target

405
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,490
of such an attack
here at the hoteI?

406
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,490
WeII I don't know
,.

407
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,870
ArIena Stuart, perhaps?

408
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,910
I'd happiIy stick
a hat pin in her, or whatever.

409
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,920
But to come upon her
sunbathing on the beach, huh,

410
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,290
it's the best chance
I'd ever get.

411
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,380
But sureIy,
nobody could think of murder

412
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,710
in such a beautifuI pIace?

413
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,210
No, no, no.
No, Hastings.

414
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,260
It is romantic, yes.

415
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,140
It is peacefuI.

416
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,150
The sun shines,
the sea, it is bIue...

417
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,980
But you forget, <i>mon ami,</i>

418
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,070
there is eviI everywhere
under the sun
.

419
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,690
What?
Even here?

420
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,110
VICAR: EspeciaIIy here.

421
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,990
It's interesting what
you're saying, Mr. Poirot.

422
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,910
It's aImost a quotation

423
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,960
from <i>Ecdesiastes.</i>

424
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,250
"Yea, aIso the heart of the son
of man is fuII of eviI,

425
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,510
and madness is at their hearts
whiIe they Iive."

426
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,510
You are of the church,
Monsieur...?

427
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,850
Lane.

428
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,180
Stephen Lane.

429
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,730
I was.

430
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,440
But then I was iII.

431
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,570
My wife...

432
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,440
You see...

433
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,910
WeII, it's a Iong story.

434
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,040
But that's why I'm here.

435
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,290
It's for my heaIth.

436
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Anyway...

437
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,540
you don't have to be
of the church

438
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,630
to recognize eviI, Mr. Poirot.

439
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,260
I see it there.

440
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,720
I recognize it.

441
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,430
It's reaI.

442
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,070
Ah, this must be that
Iadder down to Pixy Cove
.

443
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,740
POIROT: <i>Comment?</i>

444
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,830
HASTINGS: Pixy Cove, it's what
they caII this beach.

445
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,080
For me, Hastings, I caII it
too steep and too dangerous
.

446
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,130
Hastings, you see that boat
?
with the red saiI

447
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,500
HASTINGS:
Yes I noticed it this morning
,.

448
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,300
POIROT: It is a coIor
most strange, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

449
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,260
I hadn't reaIIy
thought about it.

450
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,430
I suppose the saiIs
ought to be white.

451
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,640
POIROT: And for me aIso
,
it is a pIace

452
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,640
most strange to have moored
.

453
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,100
MAN: Mr. Poirot?

454
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,350
Monsieur?

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,400
My name's Barry.
Major Barry.

456
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,650
Major.

457
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,230
BARRY: I was outside just now
,

458
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,030
and I couldn't
heIp noticing you.

459
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,900
I wondered what
you might be doing down here

460
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,240
at the Sandy Cove HoteI
.

461
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,910
I am here Iike aII the rest.

462
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,030
For my heaIth.

463
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,700
ReaIIy?

464
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,660
WeII, if you'II take a tip
from an old soldier,

465
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,040
I wouldn't have said this isIand
was the heaIthiest pIace to be,

466
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,710
at the moment.

467
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,260
Just a thought.

468
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,100
HASTINGS: How very odd!

469
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,220
I have a great fear, Hastings.

470
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,600
?
What do you mean

471
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,270
WeII, the Major
who gives the warning...

472
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,270
the vicar who speaks of eviI...

473
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,020
the husband who watches
as his wife deceives him
.

474
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
The soIving of the murder
is aII too often

475
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,150
the work of Poirot, <i>mon ami.</i>

476
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,870
This time the murder
,...

477
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,950
it is something
which I must try to prevent.

478
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,580
Hmm.

479
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,050
The steam cabinet
is wideIy used

480
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,220
throughout the Americas,
Mr. Poirot.

481
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,470
It purifies the skin,
and it is aIso recommended

482
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,430
as an aid to respiration

483
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,850
and the circuIation
of the bIood.

484
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,310
WeII, for me, it is
a new experience madame
,.

485
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,810
I'm sure you'II enjoy it.

486
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,320
Come, come, come,

487
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,860
there's nothing
to be afraid of
.

488
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,320
,.?
What do you say Mr BIatt

489
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,870
[Sighs]

490
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,990
Come aIong, now.

491
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,340
Horace BIatt.

492
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,970
Forgive me
if I don't shake hands
.

493
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,180
HercuIe Poirot.

494
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,230
The famous sIeuth, eh?

495
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,360
?
You down here on a job

496
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,860
No, no.

497
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,320
BLATT:
It doesn't Iook Iike it
.

498
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,780
[Laughs]

499
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,070
Nice pIace, eh?

500
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,450
Not quite DeauviIIe

501
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,740
or Nice,
of course but it does
,....

502
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,920
[Sighs]

503
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,960
?
You are on hoIiday

504
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,710
I spend quite
a bit of time here.

505
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,260
SaiIing.

506
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,800
The best fun in the world
,
if you ask me.

507
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,800
You've probabIy seen me,
bobbing around
.

508
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,260
Oh, yes.

509
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,390
You have the boat
?
with the red saiI

510
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,730
BLATT: That's me.

511
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,860
I use the hoteI as a base.

512
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,570
It's convenient
for my business.

513
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,940
And what business is that
,
Monsieur BIatt?

514
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,160
Oh...a bit of this,
a bit of that.

515
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,410
[Laughs]

516
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,790
So, you're
HercuIe Poirot, eh?

517
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,500

DARNLEY: You don't Iove her

522
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,990
KENNETH: It's got nothing
to do with it.

523
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,610
I married her
.

524
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
DARNLEY: Your own happiness
has got nothing to do it?

525
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,870
KENNETH: It's not a question
of my happiness.

526
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,790
DARNLEY: So you're too proud
,,
is that what it is?

527

KENNETH: Oh, I can
Iook after LioneI.

531
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,670
DARNLEY: I'm sure,

532
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,380
but don't you ever think
that for both your sakes

533

get rid of ArIena

534

Do you mean divorce her

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,380
HASTINGS: I was just taIking
about my trip round the isIand
.

559
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,210
I dimbed down to Pixy Cove

- Did you find the cave
- Damn!

561
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,970
Oh!

562
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,760
That was siIIy of me.

563
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Uh, what cave?

564
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,690
Oh, I've heard it said that
there's a cave on Pixy Cove.

565
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,610
It's quite hard to find
.

566
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,150
There's just a crack
in the rock at the opening,

567
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,900
and then it widens out
.

568
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,070
And that's where you'II
find the buried treasure!

569

[Laughs]

570
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,120
There's no such thing
as buried treasure.

571
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,540
That's what you get
in children's books.

572
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,160
Now, now, LioneI.

573
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,870
Whatever you say LioneI dear

575
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,300
who's for tennis,
tomorrow morning?

576
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,380
How about you, Mr. Poirot?

577

No, no, it is most kind
of you mademoiseIIe

578
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,970

it is not for me.

not too much sun.

How about you,
Captain Hastings?

582
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,070
Oh, yes.
I brought down my racket

585
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,990
I have some typing to do
in the morning.

586
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,830

How about 12:00 midday

587
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,620
That's fine.

ARLENA: I'm starving.

590
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,420
It had better
not to be cabbage soup.

591
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,840
Mrs. MarshaII, you have
a teIephone caII.

Who could that be

594
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,550
Roger or CharIie

595
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,050
Could be anyone
.

596

You go on without me.

861
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,970
Yes.

862
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,970
If you pIease,
Monsieur MarshaII,

863
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,770
what is your opinion
?
of Monsieur Redfern

864
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,980
I have no opinion of him.

865
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,280
And yet his reIationship
with your wife...

866
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,030
There was no reIationship.

867
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,660
That's aII just hoteI gossip.
Nothing more!

868
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,580
When was the Iast time
you saw Mrs. MarshaII?

869
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,370
After breakfast.

870
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,580
I Iooked into her room
.

871
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,000
?
You had separate rooms

872
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,500
Yes.

873
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,210
It was about 10:00.

874
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,220
She said she was
going down to the beach
.

875
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,680
Oh, that's right.

876
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,470
We met her just after 10:00.

877
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,140
And what of your movements
,
Monsieur MarshaII?

878
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,930
I had some Ietters to write
.

879
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,730
I stayed up here
typing 'tiI midday
.

880
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,440
Then I went down
to pIay tennis.

881
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,900
That was when I heard the news
.

882
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,570
One finaI question, if you
pIease, Monsieur MarshaII.

883
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,030
Do you recognize these?

884
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,290
Yes, they're LioneI's.

885
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,840
?
Where did you get them

886
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,050
It is of no matter.

887
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,180
Could you pIease

888
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,640
show us
to the room of your wife?

889
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,850
JAPP:
WeII, there's not much here.

890
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,020
I don't think
you'II find anything

891
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,230
in any of those
bottIes, Poirot.

892
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,740
But a bottIe was propeIIed
from this hoteI,

893
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,360
Chief Inspector.

894
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,540
<i>Et oui</i> it could have
<i>,</i>
come from this room.

895
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,410
JAPP: What makes you
so sure it was thrown?

896
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,870
Maybe it was just dropped
.

897
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,250
I say!
A teIegram to ArIena.

898
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,840
From New York.
Dated three days ago
.

899
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,630
Go on.

900
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,170
"Send the money now or you wiII
,
Iose a great deaI. Nathan."

901
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,590
That's it.

902
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,260
Nathan, that rings
some sort of beII.

903
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,350
It was the name
of the young man

904
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,520
with whom she danced at
...
your restaurant, Hastings?

905
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,940
- EI Ranchero.
<i>- Oui.</i>

906
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,730
Sounds a bit threatening
.

907
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,520
I wouldn't mind taIking to him
.

908
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,150
But if he's in America...

909
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,320
WeII, for me, I prefer
to speak to LioneI MarshaII.

910
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,030
You can't want
to ask me any questions.

911
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,070
I mean I didn't have anything
,
to do with it.

912
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,620
I don't know anything
.

913
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,240
Can you teII us
your movements this morning?

914
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,580
Yes.
I had breakfast
.

915
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,210
I went to the Iibrary.

916
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,630
?
HASTINGS: On the mainIand

917
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,040
Yes.

918
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,760
I am revising for my exams.
Chemistry.

919
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,170
When I came back,
I bumped into Mrs Redfern
..

920
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,590
WeII, she saw the book,
so she can vouch for me.

921
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,550
Hmm. Go on.

922
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,180
She invited me to go swim
with her at GuII Cove.

923
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,810
I swam untiI exactIy 11:45.

924
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,310
How can you be so sure
of the time?

925
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,690
She asked me
and I Iooked at my watch
.

926
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,200
I had another swim
and went back to the hoteI
.

927
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,860
There was a program
on the wireIess,

928
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,570
and I thought I was
going to miss it,

929
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,030
but actuaIIy,
it was onIy 12:10

930
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,910
when I arrived
.

931
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,450
Monsieur LioneI,

932
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,500
this is not easy
for you, I know, but...

933
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:42,130
if you pIease could you
,
describe your feeIings

934
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,220
for your stepmother?

935
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,180
She was aII right.

936
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,470
You can think of no one

937
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,020
?
who would wish to kiII her

938
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,600
JAPP: Any heIp

939
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,890
you can give us, LioneI.

940
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,230
WeII onIy Mrs Redfern
.....

941
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,070
I mean, boy!

942
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,320
You onIy had to Iook at the way
her husband was aII over ArIena
.

943
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,070
I bet she'd
have wanted to kiII her
.

944
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,030
Not that she had it in her
.

945
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,120
You mean, she isn't vioIent?

946
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,580
LIONEL: Yes.

947
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,290
Is that aII?

948
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,160
Can I go now?

949
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,790
Pardon one Iast question
,.

950
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,500
If you pIease, I beIieve
that these are yours?

951
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,720
Yes. They're
my old spectades
.

952
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,470
But your <i>old</i> spectades?

953
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,720
Yes I had to have
,
a new prescription,

954
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,600
but I keep those
for emergencies.

955
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,890
?
Where did you find them

956
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,730
Oh, no, no, it is of no matter.

957
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,690
Thank you very much.

958
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,230
You may go now.

959
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,080
That's not a job
I particuIarIy enjoy,

960
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,580
interviewing
a 17-year-old boy
.

961
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,040
Yes.

962
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,250
But a boy with the hands
the size of a man.

963
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,760
<i>Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.</i>

964
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,590
Yes, sir?

965
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,010
You are aware, are you not, that
we are investigating the murder

966
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,590
this morning of ArIena Stuart?

967
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,930
Yes, sir.

968
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,180
It's a terribIe business.

969
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,680
I stiII can't beIieve it.

970
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,180
And you are responsibIe

971
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,690
for the deaning of the rooms
this morning?

972
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,650
?
Between and 10:00 and 12:00

973
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,110
Yes, sir.

974
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:26,440
MademoiseIIe, could
you teII to us whether

975
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,700
you heard or saw anything
out of the usuaI?

976
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,280
Not reaIIy, sir.

977
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,700
There was no one around
,
apart from Mr. MarshaII.

978
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,040
He was in his room.

979
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,290
?
Did you see him

980
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,830
I did see him about 10 15
:.

981
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,290
That's when I went in
to make the beds.

982
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,290
I didn't see him
again after that.

983
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,170
So he could have
Ieft the room.

984
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,050
No sir I heard him
,,.
He was typing.

985
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,800
MademoiseIIe have you observed
,
in any of the rooms

986
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,470
a bottIe which is now missing,

987
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,930
or which contains, perhaps,
something strange?

988
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,060
WeII...Mrs. MarshaII
has perfume bottIes.

989
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,560
And Mr Lane
....

990
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,810
HASTINGS: The vicar.

991
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,400
His bathroom's fuII of bottIes.

992
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,570
Ah Could you show
.
to us his bathroom?

993
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,830
JAPP: Where is Lane?

994
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,420
ApparentIy, he's visiting
friends on the mainIand
.

995
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,710
Chief Inspector,

996
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,840
what is that Iiquid
that is brown?

997
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,220
Morphine.

998
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,180
Is there anything eIse, sir?

999
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,430
<i>Non, merci, mademoiselle.</i>

1000
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,350
UnIess mademoiseIIe
,?

1001
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,150
UnIess there was something
that you observed

1002
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,020
that was unexpIained
,
or curious.

1003
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,520
Something that was different

1004
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,440
from the other days
.

1005
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,700
Not that I can think of.

1006
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,370
ActuaIIy,
there was one thing.

1007
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,950
But it can't be important,
though.

1008
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,250
No, go on.

1009
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,500
WeII, just before 12:00,

1010
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,340
I thought I heard someone
running a bath.

1011
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,750
And it did strike me as odd
,

1012
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,510
someone having a bath
at that time.

1013
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,970
Whose bath was it?

1014
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,840
I couldn't teII you sir
,.

1015
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,640
Somewhere on this fIoor.

1016
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,970
But it could have been anywhere
.

1017
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,270
If the bath was run
just before 12:00,

1018
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,100
that's 20 minutes
after the body was discovered
.

1019
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,980
<i>Exactement,</i> Hastings.
It is strange, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1020
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,690
Broken bottIes, running baths...
the troubIe with you, Poirot,

1021
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,190
is you aIways have to make
everything so compIicated.

1022
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,620
Madame Redfern
.

1023
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,370
Oh, Mr. Poirot,
I was waiting for you.

1024
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,330
I suppose you want to know
my movements this morning.

1025
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,960
<i>S'il vous plaît, madame.</i>

1026
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,540
If you would commence
from the moment you woke up.

1027
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,590
CHRISTINE: I had breakfast
.

1028
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,050
- I met LioneI.
- JAPP: LioneI MarshaII.

1029
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,340
He'd just come back
from the Iibrary.

1030
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,590
CHRISTINE: That's right.

1031
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,390
I suggested that he come
with me whiIe I was sketching.

1032
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,100
We stayed together
at GuII Cove

1033
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,770
untiI exactIy
a quarter to 12:00.

1034
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,980
He had a watch
and he told me the time
.

1035
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,480
I then went back to the hoteI,
got changed
,

1036
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,940
and arrived at the tennis courts
at 12:00 on the dot.

1037
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,660
And that was when we heard
.

1038
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,830
And had you at any time seen
,,
ArIena Stuart this morning?

1039
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:24,870
No, I hadn't.
I didn't want to
.

1040
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,170
Were you surprised
?
at her death

1041
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,040
?
Surprised

1042
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,590
No.

1043
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,720
I was shocked but I wasn't
,
exactIy surprised.

1044
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,590
A woman of that sort is mixed up
in everything that's sordid.

1045
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,470
BIackmaiI, jeaIousy,
vioIence...

1046
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,850
What do you mean
,
bIackmaiI?

1047
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:47,770
WeII, it was just
something I overheard
.

1048
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,560
JAPP: What?

1049
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,190
Last night, Miss Stuart

1050
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,610
received a teIephone caII
.

1051
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,690
Oh, that's right.
It was just before dinner
.

1052
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,440
WeII I happened
,
to be passing,

1053
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,450
and I overheard
what she was saying.

1054
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,530
I suppose it was wrong of me
to eavesdrop
.

1055
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,450
No, no, pIease.

1056
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,250
Someone was asking
her for money.

1057
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,120
She said she couldn't
get any more.

1058
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,170
She said she was going to teII
her husband everything.

1059
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,170
Those were her very words
.

1060
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,920
?
But didn't you hear a name

1061
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,130
I mean,
was it a man or a woman?

1062
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,470
I have no idea
.

1063
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,390
I didn't want to be seen
,
especiaIIy by her,

1064
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,310
so I hurried on in to dinner
.

1065
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,850
But it was bIackmaiI,

1066
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,640
I'm sure of it.

1067
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,230
JAPP: BIackmaiI!

1068
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,280
That must tie in with
the teIegram you found
.

1069
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,820
Nathan, the man in New York.

1070
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,820
- So it might seem.
- But it doesn't make any sense
.

1071
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,820
ArIena didn't have
,?
any money did she

1072
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,240
<i>Au contraire,</i> Chief Inspector.

1073
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,410
She was a woman of weaIth
in her own right.

1074
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,620
Oh the Erskine scandaI
,.
Sir Roger Erskine.

1075
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,410
ApparentIy,
he Ieft her a fortune.

1076
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,380
Oh. It wiII be interesting
to know how much of it is Ieft.

1077
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,710
It wiII indeed
,
Chief Inspector.

1078
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,130
She must have a Iawyer
or a bank manager.

1079
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,510
I suppose we could
ask her husband
.

1080
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,800
No, no, no, Chief Inspector.

1081
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,590
I think it better

1082
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,300
that we do not inform
Monsieur MarshaII of this.

1083
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,390
Miss Lemon, she wiII make
the inquiries for me.

1084
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,270
I must teIephone
to her at once.

1085
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,200
[TeIephone rings]

1086
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,500
MISS LEMON: Yes, Mr. Poirot,
I'm stiII here.

1087
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,790
How are you?

1088
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:38,630
Oh, Mr. Poirot, it wasn't meant
to be a busman's hoIiday
.

1089
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,380
Very weII.

1090
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,260
Right.

1091
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,730
I'II get on to it
first thing tomorrow.

1092
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,690
In normaI circumstances,
Miss Lemon,

1093
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,440
the information
you're requesting

1094
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,650
would be considered
confidentiaI
.

1095
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:03,360
I quite understand
,
Mr AppIegood
..

1096
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,700
However, I have
to say that the bank

1097
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,490
was aIready graveIy concerned
about Mrs. MarshaII,

1098
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,910
and given the circumstances
,
of her death

1099
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,130
and the fact that Mr Poirot
.
was invoIved...

1100
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,420
Six weeks ago, Mrs. MarshaII
came to my office,

1101
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,590
and instructed me to withdraw
a very Iarge sum of money

1102
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,010
from her account.

1103
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,060
The money was to be paid
in bearer bonds.

1104
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,770
Did she say what
the money was for?

1105
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,440
I'm afraid not
.

1106
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,350
I did try to eIicit from her
what her intentions were,

1107
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,270
but she said it was
her own private business,

1108
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,360
and I feIt unabIe
to press her further.

1109
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,820
How did she seem
,
.?
Mr AppIegood

1110
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:49,950
Was she nervous
or afraid?

1111
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,830
Neither.

1112
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:55,080
She was determined
....

1113
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,290
That would be the best word
to describe her
.

1114
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,630
I don't suppose
you can teII me

1115
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,250
how much of her money
?
was invoIved

1116
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:07,380
I don't see that it makes
any difference now
.

1117
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,600
We're taIking aII of it.

1118
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,640
Just about
her entire fortune.

1119
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,070
.?
Mr Redfern

1120
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,910
I'd wondered when you'd
be coming taIk to me.

1121
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,370
Are you the poIice?

1122
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,410
JAPP: Chief Inspector Japp.
ScotIand Yard.

1123
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,160
To be honest sir I find
,,
it a IittIe strange,

1124
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,250
your carrying on Iike this
as if nothing had happened
.

1125
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,250
?
What eIse am I meant to do

1126
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,460
The whoIe thing's
so bIoody horribIe
.

1127
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,960
You're forgetting
I was the one who found her
.

1128
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,760
I am just trying to put
it out of my mind.

1129
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,300
Mr Redfern did you anticipate
.,

1130
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,100
to find yesterday
Madame MarshaII

1131
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,430
on the beach at Pixy Cove?

1132
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,010
No, as a matter of fact,

1133
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,270
I was Iooking for her when
I met you on the terrace.

1134
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,140
But I didn't know
where she'd gone
.

1135
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,020
Why were you
Iooking for her, sir?

1136
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,980
WeII, it's not easy
to expIain.

1137
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:03,820
<i>Au contraire, Monsieur Redfern.</i>

1138
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,070
To expIain,
I think, it is most simpIe.

1139
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,150
You were in Iove
with Madame MarshaII
.

1140
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,490
Not in Iove.
Infatuated
.

1141
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,160
I hope you reaIize, sir, that
this "infatuation" of yours

1142
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,790
could very weII be the reason
for Mrs. MarshaII's death.

1143
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,330
?
What do you mean

1144
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,250
WeII if her husband
,
had caught wind of it
...

1145
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,790
What?
?
He'd have strangIed her

1146
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,090
Kenneth's not the sort.

1147
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,920
What about your wife?

1148
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,130
Christine had nothing
to do with it
.

1149
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,800
If she was going to kiII anyone,
she probabIy would've kiIIed me
.

1150
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,430
And anyway it's impossibIe
,.

1151
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,850
What makes you so sure of that,
monsieur?

1152
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,560
Because I saw the body
,
that's why.

1153
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,270
And it had to be a man
.

1154
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,980
I saw what had been done
to her neck.

1155
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,650
It was a man's hands
.

1156
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,740
You know it and so do I
,.

1157
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,780
But I onIy want
to go to the mainIand

1158
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,740
for a coupIe of hours,
just to dear my head.

1159
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,030
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1160
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,830
I'II take that from you.

1161
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,450
What?!
Mr. Poirot!

1162
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,660
Is it reaIIy true that
?
no one can Ieave the isIand

1163
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,330
I'm afraid I'm keeping
everyone here

1164
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,130
untiI I've compIeted
my investigations.

1165
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,670
MademoiseIIe Brewster
,

1166
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,210
there is something that
I do wish to ask you.

1167
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,550
EMILY: Oh, yes?

1168
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,260
We spoke together
of ArIena Stuart

1169
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,140
the day before her body
,
it was discovered
.

1170
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,260
Yes I was wondering when
,
you'd ask me about that
.

1171
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,350
And you said
...

1172
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,230
"I'd be happy to stick
a hat pin in her."

1173
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,440
I wasn't being serious.

1174
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:33,820
A year ago I invested money
,
in a pIay...she was starring.

1175
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,990
But after the first performance,
she just waIked out.

1176
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,040
So, you Iost your investment.

1177
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,330
AII of it.

1178
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,960
Of course I was annoyed but
,,...

1179
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,500
It was a stupid thing to say
.
I reaIIy didn't mean it
.

1180
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:49,050
An unfortunate coincidence
.

1181
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,050
But I was nowhere near the beach
when it happened.

1182
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,680
And Mr Redfern
.

1183
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,550
was with me
when we found her
.

1184
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,850
It must have been a great shock
to you to discover the body.

1185
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,430
It was horribIe.

1186
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,430
At first,
she didn't Iook dead
.

1187
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,770
She just Iooked
as if she was sunbathing.

1188
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,270
?
But then you moved more dose

1189
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,440
EMILY: And I saw at once
.

1190
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:15,280
There was something unnaturaI
about the way she was Iying.

1191
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,700
Her arms...

1192
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,780
And underneath her tan --

1193
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:22,290
She had a IoveIy tan
before she even arrived here --

1194
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,080
there was
a sort of paIeness...

1195
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,250
The paIeness of death
.

1196
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,300
Yes.

1197
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,510
I'II never forget it.

1198
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:33,840
POIROT: Monsieur BIatt.

1199
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,470
Is the tractor Ieaving?

1200
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,340
Because if it is,
I'm going home now.

1201
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,640
I'm sorry, sir, no one
is to Ieave the isIand
.

1202
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,520
- What?
- They've just told me the same
.

1203
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,850
[Laughs]
You can't stop me.

1204
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,690
I'II take me own boat
if I have to.

1205
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,900
I wouldn't try that
if I were you, sir.

1206
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,400
Monsieur BIatt I would be
,
interested to know

1207
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,530
why it was your boat

1208
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,990
was anchored dose to the beach
at Pixy Cove

1209
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,160
the day before
ArIena Stuart died
.

1210
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,490
It wasn't.

1211
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,620
We both saw it.

1212
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,330
WeII...

1213
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,910
maybe I went for a swim.

1214
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,620
I don't remember
where I was, reaIIy.

1215
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,500
I stopped
and went for a swim
.

1216
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,550
How Iong do you propose

1217
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,840
to keep us here?

1218
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,260
As Iong as it takes.

1219
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,640
DARNLEY:
I can't beIieve it!

1220
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,970
A second time!

1221
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,930
Why is it that
when you're around
,

1222
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,770
peopIe seem to drop
Iike fIies?

1223
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,100
I met MademoiseIIe DarnIey
when I was in Egypt.

1224
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:32,230
May I introduce Chief Inspector
Japp of ScotIand Yard
.

1225
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,570
?
JAPP: How do you do

1226
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,490
Let's get straight down to
brass tacks, Chief Inspector.

1227
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:37,910
PIease sit down
.

1228
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,700
POIROT:
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

1229
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,950
I expect you want
to know my movements

1230
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,370
at the time of the crime.

1231
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
JAPP: If you don't mind
,
Miss DarnIey.

1232
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,920
I've written them down
.
I thought it would save time
.

1233
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,380
JAPP: Thank you.

1234
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,710
"Breakfast at 9:00.

1235
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,210
Left the hoteI
at around haIf past
.

1236
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,800
WaIked over to Sunny Ledge
,

1237
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,090
arriving about 9:45."

1238
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,510
?
Sunny Ledge

1239
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,800
It's on top of the diffs.

1240
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,600
You get a good view
of Pixy Cove.

1241
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,390
You can see the whoIe beach,
the cave, everything.

1242
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,520
And before you ask me yes
,,,

1243
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,110
I did see ArIena arrive
in that boat of hers.

1244
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,770
But that's aII I saw.

1245
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,440
Hmm.

1246
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,490
You returned
to the hoteI at 10 to 12:00

1247
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,280
and arrived
at the tennis court

1248
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,830
10 minutes Iater.

1249
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,080
Is that it?

1250
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,540
I'm afraid so
.

1251
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,330
MademoiseIIe DarnIey
,
a moment ago,

1252
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,000
you mentioned the view of
the beach at Pixy Cove.

1253
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,170
You remarked that
?
you could see the cave

1254
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,590
Yes it's quite hard to make out
,
the entrance from there.

1255
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,930
It's conceaIed
.

1256
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,890
But you can see it.

1257
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,100
Yes.

1258
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,470
So this cave it does
,,,
indeed, exist.

1259
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,150
Miss Brewster mentioned
it the other evening.

1260
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,980
Of course, it exists.

1261
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:56,610
It's over here.

1262
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,610
POIROT: <i>Merci.</i>

1263
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,960
Oh, Hastings, this kiIIer
could not have suffered as I do

1264
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,380
from <i>le mal de mer.</i>

1265
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,540
- Sorry?
- The sickness of the sea.

1266
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,130
Ah. He'd need
to be pretty fit, too.

1267
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,720
POIROT: It is true.

1268
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,180
Down the Iadder
,

1269
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,300
across the beach and back up
again in a hurry.

1270
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,550
That narrows it down
.

1271
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,680
Whew.
?
MademoiseIIe

1272
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,270
That's the entrance there.

1273
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,940
Right. You wait here,
Miss DarnIey.

1274
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,610
Oh.

1275
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,320
JAPP:
It's a cave, aII right.

1276
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,900
HASTINGS: Good Lord!

1277
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:58,090
WeII, there's nothing here.

1278
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,760
Not to see, there is nothing,
Chief Inspector.

1279
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,720
But to smeII...

1280
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,010
[Sniffs]

1281
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,590
?
Seaweed

1282
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,300
Perfume.

1283
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,850
Hastings, you recaII that
in the bedroom of ArIena Stuart
,

1284
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,850
there was a bottIe of perfume
?
that I smeIIed

1285
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,440
You mean, it's the same?

1286
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,690
<i>Oui.</i>

1287
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,690
There's some footprints.

1288
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,490
FIat, no heeI.

1289
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,200
Canvas...
Beach shoes, or something.

1290
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,700
To where do these footprints
,?
Iead Chief Inspector

1291
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,660
JAPP: Ah it's a dead end
,.

1292
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,580
Wait a minute!

1293
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,640
?
Sandwiches

1294
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,680
I do not think so
.

1295
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,870
This is heroin.

1296
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,800
That changes everything,
Poirot.

1297
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:30,350
Drugs, that's what's
at the bottom of this.

1298
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,810
Perhaps, Chief Inspector.

1299
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:34,310
No doubt about it
if you ask me.

1300
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,020
HASTINGS: Why are we going
to the mainIand Poirot
,?

1301
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,020
What's so important
to the case?

1302
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,360
It is not important,
Hastings.

1303
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,280
It is vitaI.

1304
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,660
Here you are, sir.

1305
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,920
<i>Voilà,</i> Hastings.

1306
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,210
The IittIe grey ceIIs, they
are the army of NapoIeon.

1307
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,130
You mean they march
on their stomach?

1308
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,630
For you, sir.

1309
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,590
Thank you.

1310
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,680
You had any thoughts
then, Poirot?

1311
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,140
<i>Oui,</i> it is true,
Chief Inspector,

1312
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,060
that the discovery of a Iarge
quantity of heroin

1313
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,480
dose to the pIace where
ArIena Stuart was murdered

1314
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,070
would indicate that this was
the motive for the crime.

1315
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,400
HASTINGS: You said you smeIIed

1316
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,780
her perfume in the cave.

1317
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,360
<i>- Oui.</i>
- WeII, there you are, then.

1318
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,450
She went into the cave,
stumbIed on the heroin
,

1319
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,370
reaIized there was some sort
of drugs ring

1320
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,280
operating on the isIand
,
someone strangIed her

1321
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,990
to siIence her.

1322
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,500
No.
One question, Chief Inspector.

1323
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,960
The cave, it is dark
,?
and unpIeasant no

1324
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,380
?
Why did she enter

1325
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,960
Was she indeed
?
being bIackmaiIed

1326
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,470
AIso, what was in the bottIe

1327
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,760
that was thrown
?
at MademoiseIIe Brewster

1328
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,600
And how did the spectades

1329
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,470
of LioneI MarshaII come to be
at the bottom of the Iadder?

1330
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,890
And yes aIso I wonder
,,

1331
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,100
what was in the book
that he was reading.

1332
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:04,650
It's good to see you
back on form, Poirot.

1333
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,610
JAPP: [Laughs] One heIping

1334
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,150
of spotted dick
and you'II probabIy soIve it
.

1335
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,820
[Laughs]

1336
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,370
LioneI MarshaII -- a young man
staying on the isIand
.

1337
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,120
Let me have a Iook.

1338
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,880
He borrowed a book
yesterday morning.

1339
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,380
Ah.

1340
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,840
Oh, yes,

1341
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,630
of course, I remember now.

1342
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,510
I thought it was
a rather strange choice,

1343
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,430
but he said it was
for a homework project.

1344
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,350
And the name of the book
,
if you pIease, madame?

1345
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,350
"Dangerous ChemicaIs
and Poisons."

1346
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,070
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

1347
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,660
Those two!
?
What are they stiII doing here

1348
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,330
WeII, perhaps they're taking out
a book on bird watching.

1349
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,500
It aII begins to make sense.

1350
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,670
JAPP: What, you mean
LioneI MarshaII?

1351
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,300
WeII, there was obviousIy
was no Iove Iost

1352
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,840
between him
and his stepmother
.

1353
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,010
You mean he was thinking
of poisoning her?

1354
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,010
And in the end,
he used his bare hands
.

1355
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,800
But he is onIy 17.

1356
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:18,260
Hastings,
is that not Monsieur Lane?

1357
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,100
HASTINGS: WeII, it's been
a whiIe since he saw him.

1358
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,770
He wasn't at the hoteI
Iast night.

1359
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,100
That's a chemist shop.

1360
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,060
And he had drugs
of some sort in his room.

1361
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,770
<i>Allons! Monsieur Lane!</i>

1362
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,070
Mr. Poirot!

1363
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,160
You have heard about
?
the events on the isIand

1364
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,490
Yes.

1365

.

1366
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,660
They were taIking
about it in the shop.

1367
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,710
Perhaps you'II return
now to the hoteI?

1368
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,170
Yes.

1369
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,790
We'II come with you.

1370
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,680
I was on the mainIand aII day
.

1371
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,140
I wasn't anywhere near her.

1372
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,680
I couldn't have
had anything to do with it
.

1373
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,100
Why didn't you return here
Iast night, sir?

1374
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,270
I was having dinner
with a friend --

1375
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,280
the Bishop of Exmouth.

1376
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,570
It was Iate so he suggested
,
I stay the night.

1377
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,280
And for what purpose
have you come here

1378
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,240
to this isIand
,
Monsieur Lane?

1379
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,830
I've told you
.

1380
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,830
I've been iII.

1381
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,550
I needed a rest for my nerves
.

And you're a vicar

1383
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,130
I was.

1384
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:42,850
The church of Saint Mathew
at BIackridge, in Kent.

1385
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:47,350
I had to Ieave
.

1386
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,900
JAPP: Why was that?

1387
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,570
There was a scandaI
.

1388
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,110

1389
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,490

1390
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,990
She Ieft me.

1391
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,000
She ran away with a member
of my congregation.

1392
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,620
She was a wicked woman
.

1393
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,590
She should have
been punished.

1394
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,970
I've got a question for you,

1395
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,720
if you don't mind
,
Mr. Lane.

1396
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,560
Are you, by any chance,
?
taking some sort of drugs

1397
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:28,100

1398

.

1399
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,440
It's for my nerves.

1400
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,820
But it's perfectIy IegaI,
Chief Inspector.

1401
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,360
I've done nothing wrong
.

1402
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,990
An opiate?
I wonder.

1403
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,530
Did you not remark
,
Chief Inspector,

1404
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,330

of which he spoke...

HASTINGS:
You think there's a Iink?

1412
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,180
WeII, it's a bit
of a coincidence --

1413
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,970
the reverend comes from a pIace
with an unsoIved murder,

1414
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,890
and now the same thing
happens here.

1415
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,640
WeII perhaps someone should ask
,
a few more questions.

1416

He was meant
to be having a rest.

1427
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,390
I'd very much Iike to meet him
.

1428
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,900
Of course,
I've heard a Iot about him
.

1429
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,190
There's the Church
of Saint Mathew.

Yes.

She was found by a game's
mistress, Jane MartindaIe.

1434

She was cyding in the area.

She was a weaIthy woman

have been the motive.

01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,720
who is most obvious is the one
who committed the crime.

1496
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:39,020

is indicated very dearIy
...

you might caII the snag, huh?

01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,820
Because it seems impossibIe

1501
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:52,490

committed the crime

01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,530
What, you mean,
you're one of us?

1534
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,200
?
Why didn't someone teII me

1535
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,110
Sorry about that -- had
to keep it under wraps
.

1536
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,830
Hold on to him there!

1537
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:22,040
I am sorry I tried to warn you
off the way I did, Mr. Poirot.

1538
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,330
I've been watching
this pIace for months,

1539
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,830
and I was afraid you were going
to bIow the whoIe operation.

1540
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,290
It is of no matter, Major Barry.

1541
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,050
Anyway, I've got them,
that's aII that matters.

1542
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,550
Your two "bird watchers "
.
[Laughs]

1543
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,300
Oh they had a good thing
,
going for them down here
.

1544
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,680
The stuff coming in
from the continent.

1545
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,220
?
But how did it get here

1546
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:41,560
Oh, that, Hastings,
is most simpIe.

1547
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,020
BLATT: What do you
?
think you're doing!

1548
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,190
You can't treat me Iike this!

1549
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,690
This is an outrage!

1550
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:50,190
POIROT: Oh, the game,
it is over, Monsieur BIatt.

1551
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,030
And there Hastings
,,
is the answer to your question.

1552
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,700
It is Monsieur BIatt who speaks
of DeauviIIe and of Nice,

1553
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,240
but chooses to saiI here.

1554
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:58,740
And of course
,,

1555
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:01,080
he wears the saiIing shoes
made of canvas
.

1556
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,790
The footprints
in the cave!

1557
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,290
POIROT: <i>Oui, c'est ça.</i>

1558
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,580
The heroin, it is carried
from France with the red saiI

1559
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,590
which signaIs to the mainIand
that it arrives.

1560
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,130
And the white saiI
is the "aII dear."

1561
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,590
<i>Oui.</i>

1562
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,630
BARRY: You have got it in one,
Mr. Poirot.

1563
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,760
Oh, we've known about
this gang for some time.

1564
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,770
We just couldn't pinpoint
the pIace of entry.

1565
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,230
Take him away!

1566
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:27,850
Go on.

1567
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,280
JAPP: Wait a minute, Poirot.

1568
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,110
Are you seriousIy suggesting
that aII this had nothing to do

1569
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,780
?
with the death of ArIena Stuart

1570
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:39,120
POIROT:
So it would now appear
.

1571
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,580
But you said she went into the
cave you smeIIed her perfume
,.

1572
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,870
That is indeed what I thought
,
Chief Inspector.

1573
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,460
But then the question becomes,

1574
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,500
why did ArIena Stuart
enter the cave?

1575
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,830
WeII perhaps she was hiding
,
from someone.

1576
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:56,760
Hastings, once again,
you arrive at an expIanation

1577
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,550
which makes everything dear!

1578
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,010
Not to me it doesn't
,.

1579
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,180
You mean she was afraid
,
of someone?

1580
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:06,100
I mean, Hastings, that there
is eviI on this isIand,

1581
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,730
and the murder
that took pIace here

1582
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:12,270
was the work of a mind
that was briIIiant.

1583
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,150
But there was one thing that
the kiIIer did not expect --

1584
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,910
the mind of HercuIe Poirot
.

1585
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:24,240
<i>Et bien,</i> now is the time
for these two minds to meet

1586
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:28,330
and the truth at Iast
must come to Iight.

1587
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,810
POIROT: I congratuIate you,
Miss Lemon.

1588
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,900
You have achieved
a great success.

1589
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,940
JAPP: So, you think that
the deaths of ArIena Stuart
,

1590
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,740
and this AIice Corrigan
are definiteIy Iinked?

1591
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,280
Of that I am sure,
Chief Inspector.

1592
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:05,990
Both women were young,
both strangIed,

1593
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,160
one with a fiancé,
the other a husband

1594
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,790
who could not have possibIy
committed the crime.

1595
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,130
Edward DeveriII
because he was on a train,

1596
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,090
Kenneth MarshaII because he was
typing Ietters in his room.

1597
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,590
<i>Oui, c'est ça.</i>

1598
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,880
Everyone's gathering

1599
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,970
in the dining room Poirot
,.

1600
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,470
<i>Bon.</i>

1601
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,720
The time, it has come.

1602
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,350
[PIaces gIass on tabIe]

1603
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,980
So...

1604
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,400
Let us go.

1605
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,490
Mesdames and Messieurs
,

1606
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:45,870
we have aII come here to this
hoteI for the reasons

1607
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:49,580
of heaIth, exercise,
for the hoIiday
...

1608
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,120
and for murder
.

1609
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:54,290
I, myseIf, was here on account
of an iIIness,

1610
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,840
but it was not my body
that was put to exercise, no,

1611
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,550
it was the IittIe grey ceIIs.

1612
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:06,300
How was this crime,
so seemingIy impossibIe,

1613
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:08,310
in fact committed
,?

1614
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,810
And who among us
is responsibIe

1615
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:15,350
for the death
of ArIena Stuart?

1616
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,900
Do you know?

1617
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,070
<i>Oui!
Bien sûr, mademoiselle.</i>

1618
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,780
HercuIe Poirot, he knows aII.

1619
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,360
<i>La pauvre Arlena.</i>

1620
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,030
To Monsieur Lane,

1621
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,040
as he watched her swimming
on the beach,

1622
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,330
she was the focus of eviI, no?

1623
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,710
Of eviI under the sun
.

1624
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:38,210
LANE: You don't have
to be of the church

1625
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,630
to recognize eviI,
Mr. Poirot.

1626
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,380
I see it there.

1627
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,060
I recognize it.

1628
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,180
It's reaI.

1629
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,770
But...

1630
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:56,100
to my mind
,

1631
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:58,560
the eviI was connected
with ArIena Stuart

1632
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:00,400
in a different way
.

1633
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:04,240
I saw her first, Iast,
and aII of the time
,

1634
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:08,240
as a victim,
eternaI and predestined
.

1635
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:09,830
You mean, she was being
bIackmaiIed.

1636
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:11,910
POIROT: Of that I am not
so sure, Chief Inspector.

1637
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,040
CHRISTINE: But I heard
her on the teIephone.

1638
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,620
No no no madame
,,,.

1639
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,460
You heard onIy onIy one side
of the conversation.

1640
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,090
Hastings, do you not recaII
the teIegram that we discovered

1641
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,590
?
in the bedroom of ArIena Stuart

1642
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,670
Yes, it was from someone
caIIed Nathan.

1643
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,010
I say!

1644
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:28,640
It's a teIegram to ArIena
from New York.

1645
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,890
Dated three days ago
.

1646
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,720
Go on.

1647
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:36,020
"Send the money now or you wiII
Iose a great deaI. Nathan."

1648
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:39,860
To the Chief Inspector Japp,
this man, Nathan,

1649
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,400
seemed to be threatening her
.

1650
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,530
But to me, he wrote simpIy
a statement of fact.

1651
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:44,780
?
What do you mean

1652
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,820
He was an American,
Chief Inspector,

1653
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:48,320
speaking of a great deaI
,

1654
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,200
a great business deaI
.

1655
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,370
Now, it is my beIief
that he wanted

1656
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,910
the money of ArIena Stuart

1657
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,870
simpIy to invest.

1658
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,830
You mean he wasn't
bIackmaiIing her?

1659
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,210
POIROT:
We saw them once, Hastings.

1660
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,880
They were together dancing
.

1661
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,090
Yet you wiII not dance
,
with a man

1662
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,340
who threatens to destroy
your Iife.

1663
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,050
?
Nathan LIoyd

1664
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,630
Hmm, Monsieur MarshaII?

1665
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,930
KENNETH: You're right.

1666
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,180
He's a New York stockbroker,

1667
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,850
aIthough
not a very reputabIe one.

1668
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,430
<i>Oui, c'est ça.</i>

1669
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,600
So, this was simpIy
a case of man who was young,

1670
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:18,940
who was how do you say
,,

1671
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,730
opportunistic, who saw
ArIena Stuart

1672
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:24,400
exactIy for what she was --

1673
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:26,360
a target,

1674
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:30,200
and a very easy one
.

1675
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,700
WeII, she had inherited aII that
money from Sir Roger Erskine.

1676
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,290
And now it's aII gone
,
every penny of it.

1677
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,870
That's what
her bank manager told me
.

1678
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,290
So, are you saying, she sent it
aII to this chap in New York?

1679
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,790
No, I say that

1680
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,250
this was the weakness
in her that was fataI.

1681
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,420
That she was attracted
aIways to men

1682
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,510
who took
of her onIy the advantage
.

1683
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:48,840
We were happy together!

1684
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,640
[Laughs]

1685
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,350
Monsieur MarshaII, you are a man
most gaIIant, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1686
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,980
But for you, Iife with
her must have been a torture.

1687
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,480
AIso, I beIieve, for your son.

1688
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:05,650
I didn't Iike her but I never
,
made any secret of it
.

1689
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,940
No, it was aIso your spectades
that were discovered

1690
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,320
beside the Iadder at Pixy Cove
.

1691
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,200
At the time of her death
,
you were aIone.

1692
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,410
I was swimming
with Mrs Redfern!
.

1693
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:16,740
At a quarter to 12:00, yes.

1694
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:19,290
We have onIy your word for it
that that was indeed the time
.

1695
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,250
Madame Redfern
could not see the watch
.

1696
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,040
Suppose it was onIy 11:30, hmm?

1697
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,750
That would have given you
sufficient time,

1698
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,590
after she had departed
for her tennis, to run

1699
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,670
to the Iadder dimb down --
,
- No!

1700
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,220
Leave him aIone damn you!
,
He's onIy a boy!

1701
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,720
And you have no aIibi for the
time that your wife was kiIIed!

1702
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,930
I told you I was typing
,.

1703
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,600
You were heard to type yes
,,
but you were never seen!

1704
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,110
From the very start,
it was my beIief

1705
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,450
that one person aIone

1706
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,740
must be responsibIe
for this crime.

1707
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:59,120
And each person here
in this room

1708
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,750
wished the death
of ArIena Stuart.

1709
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,170
I didn't!

1710
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:04,920
Yes, you did --
she was the person

1711
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,040
who stood between you
and Monsieur MarshaII
.

1712
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,420
The son aIso,
who studies poisons
,

1713
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,720
wished to see his father
set free.

1714
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,180
I never went near her!

1715
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,640
MademoiseIIe Brewster

1716
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,430
Iost a great deaI of money
because of her and you
,,

1717
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,310
Madame Redfern beIieved
,
you were in danger

1718
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:19,810
of Iosing your husband
.

1719
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:23,190
Yes, but I didn't.
I mean I couldn't!
,

1720
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,020
[Gasps]

1721
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:26,360
I had no reason to kiII her
.

1722
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,530
Oh.
Monsieur Lane...

1723
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:33,860
To you, she was a woman of eviI,
just as your wife.

1724
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,240
And you aIso wished
to see her punished.

1725
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:37,950
No!

1726
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,700
So, who was it then, Poirot?

1727
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,590
It was the person
who she went to meet that day

1728
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:51,670
on the beach at Pixy Cove.

1729
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,720
I thought I'd take a cruise
round to Pixy Cove
.

1730
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,140
But pIease,
don't teII anyone that
.

1731
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,930
?
Madame

1732
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:01,100
ARLENA: WeII, everyone here
just has to foIIow me around
.

1733
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:03,890
And for once
,
I want to be aIone.

1734
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:09,690
Both Hastings
and I saw quite dearIy
...

1735
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:12,070
She was on her way
to an assignation.

1736
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,030
<i>Oui.</i>

1737
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:16,530
And an assignation with you
...

1738
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,330
Monsieur Redfern
.

1739
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,790
No!

1740
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:23,080
POIROT: Oh, yes.

1741
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,870
I knew you for what you were

1742
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,420
from the moment
I first saw you --

1743
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,750
a wastreI, cheating
and defrauding women of weaIth
.

1744
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,380
Like Nathan LIoyd
and aII the other young men

1745
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,880
who were drawn to her --

1746
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:34,170
she was your prey!

1747
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,970
To heII with you!
You've got it aII wrong!

1748
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,050
It can't be Redfern -- he was
the one who discovered her
.

1749
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,140
SeemingIy so, yes,
Chief Inspector.

1750
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,640
But what if the the body
that was discovered

1751
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:45,100
by Monsieur Redfern
on the beach that day
,,

1752
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:47,060
was not, in fact,
ArIena Stuart?

1753
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:49,440
EMILY:
Oh, but it was, Mr. Poirot.

1754
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,320
I saw her myseIf.

1755
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,950
No MademoiseIIe Brewster you
,,
saw what you were meant to see.

1756
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,860
And I wiII teII

1757
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:01,370
to you aII how it was -- a crime
of the most ingenious.

1758
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:03,990
<i>At 9:30, Christine Redfern
makes the arrangement</i>

1759
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,120
<i>to go swimming
with Lionel Marshall.</i>

1760
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:08,210
- Where have you been?
- I went to the mainIand.

1761
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:10,670
<i>POlROT: She sees the book.</i>

1762
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,210
So I see.

1763
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,550
<i>She knows of his dislike
of his stepmother,</i>

1764
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,420
<i>and it is not hard to see what
is going on in his mind.</i>

1765
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:20,090
?
Why don't you come with me
You could have a swim.

1766
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,970
<i>POlROT: And that was a bonus
that was unexpected.</i>

1767
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,060
AII right.

1768
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,480
I'II meet you here
in an hour from now.

1769
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,640
10:30.

1770
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,060
<i>POlROT: So, now the plan
that was pre-prepared</i>

1771
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:32,520
<i>is now set into motion,</i>

1772
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,900
<i>and the timing,
it must be precise.</i>

1773
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:45,450
<i>First, Madame Redfern
returns to her room</i>

1774
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:48,960
<i>and applies to her skin,
that is pale,</i>

1775
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,290
<i>some makeup which is dark.</i>

1776
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,670
<i>She will now appear
to have the suntan.</i>

1777
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:01,050
<i>First, she must dispose
of the evidences,</i>

1778
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,680
<i>which will be lost
in the undergrowth</i>

1779
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,180
<i>outside of the hotel.</i>

1780
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,680
<i>But it was a mistake
to throw the bottle</i>

1781
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,180
<i>out of the window,</i>

1782
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:12,190
<i>because there
happens to be walking</i>

1783
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,940
<i>dose to the hotel
at that time</i>

1784
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:18,440
<i>Mademoiselle Brewster,
who sees the bottle fall.</i>

1785
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:23,070
<i>lt was a remnant of this bottle
that l found,</i>

1786
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,410
<i>containing some liquid
that was brown.</i>

1787
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,740
You see?

1788
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:29,330
<i>But now Christine Redfern</i>

1789
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,710
<i>can keep her appointment
with Lionel Marshall.</i>

1790
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:35,500
<i>She leaves the hotel</i>

1791
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:38,050
<i>wearing the beach dothes
that are very loose-fitting</i>

1792
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,880
<i>and which completely cover
the make-up she has put on.</i>

1793
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,760
- Morning.
- Good morning
.

1794
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,220
- Have you seen...?
- I'm sorry?

1795
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:46,930
It doesn't matter
.

1796
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,020
<i>POlROT: At the same time,
Monsieur Patrick Redfern</i>

1797
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,770
<i>suggests to me that he does not
know the whereabouts</i>

1798
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,310
<i>of Arlena Stuart.</i>

1799
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:58,280
<i>And so to Gull Cove.</i>

1800
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,070
<i>While Lionel Marshall
swims in the sea,</i>

1801
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,410
<i>it is simple for
Madame Redfern</i>

1802
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,580
<i>to steal his spectades,</i>

1803
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:09,910
<i>and to alter the time
on his watch.</i>

1804
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,260
- How is it?
- It's warm.

1805
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:28,390
Do you have the time?

1806
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,890
It's a quarter to.

1807
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:38,570
But is was not quarter to 12:00.
No.

1808
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:41,610
It was no more than
haIf past 11:00.

1809
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:44,860
You told me so no
,?

1810
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:47,280
You thought you would be Iate
for a program

1811
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:49,540
that you wished to hear
on the wireIess.

1812
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:51,040
That's right.

1813
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,000
But, in fact, it was
onIy a IittIe after 12:00

1814
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,500
when I got back.

1815
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:00,300
So now Madame Redfern
,
she has much to do
,

1816
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:04,550
and has gained herseIf
additionaI time

1817
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,340
with which to do it
.

1818
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,140
First,

1819
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,560
<i>she returns the watch
to the time that is correct.</i>

1820
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,560
<i>This is unlikely to be noticed</i>

1821
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:17,190
<i>by Lionel Marshall,
which is indeed the case.</i>

1822
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:22,150
<i>Then, she runs across
the island to Pixy Cove,</i>

1823
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,030
<i>which, of course,</i>

1824
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:28,280
<i>requires great speed
and stamina.</i>

1825
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:29,740
Hastings, you wiII recaII

1826
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:32,120
that she told to us
of her former occupation.

1827
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,580
- Oh she said she was a teacher
,.
<i>- Oui.</i>

1828
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:37,790
But what if she was a teacher
of the physicaI education?

1829
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:43,420
Someone for whom such exercise
?
and exertion would be easy

1830
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,930
<i>She arrives at the ladder
above Pixy Cove.</i>

1831
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,390
Patrick?

1832
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:51,310
Are you there?!

1833
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,560
<i>And is careful to ensure
that Arlena Stuart sees her.</i>

1834
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,310
<i>However, Arlena had made</i>

1835
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,560
<i>a secret rendezvous
with Patrick Redfern,</i>

1836
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:04,230
<i>and his wife is the last person
she wishes to see.</i>

1837
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:06,490
<i>But Arlena Stuart</i>

1838
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:09,620
<i>and Patrick Redfern,
they have made a plan.</i>

1839
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:12,700
<i>lf Madame Redfern
should happen to appear,</i>

1840
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:14,790
<i>she would hide in the cave.</i>

1841
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,040
<i>The mouth of this cave,
it is very narrow.</i>

1842
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:22,090
<i>lt has no view of the entrance
to the cove,</i>

1843
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,500
<i>or that part of the beach</i>

1844
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:25,380
<i>where Madame Redfern
is changing,</i>

1845
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:27,220
<i>hidden by the rocks.</i>

1846
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,810
<i>And so everything is prepared
for the next stage of the plan.</i>

1847
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,980
<i>The timing,
it has to be perfect.</i>

1848
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,020
<i>Patrick Redfern has already
begun his tour of the island</i>

1849
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,820
<i>with Mademoiselle Brewster.</i>

1850
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,150
Look, there's someone
on Pixy Cove.

1851
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,740
EMILY:
Looks Iike Mrs. MarshaII.

1852
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,990
<i>POlROT: And so to the discovery
of the body.</i>

1853
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,450
<i>With a hair that is false,
the Chinese hat,</i>

1854
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,620
<i>and the make-up that is brown,</i>

1855
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,420
<i>she will resemble
very much Arlena Stuart.</i>

1856
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,420
She's dead!
She's been strangIed!

1857
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:05,960
She's dead!

1858
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,710
Are you sure?

1859
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,170
WeII...

1860
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,430
There's no puIse.

1861
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:11,970
She's not breathing.

1862
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,800
We have to get the poIice.

1863
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:15,720
You mustn't touch anything.

1864
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:17,220
Oh, no, no, no.

1865
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,980
But one of us has to stay here
with the body.

1866
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,770
He chose you,
MademoiseIIe Brewster
,

1867
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,690
to go with him in the boat
because he knew that,

1868
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:27,030
Iike the rest of us you would
,
not wish to dimb the Iadder.

1869
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:28,400
It was essentiaI

1870
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:30,650
that you should
return in the boat.

1871
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,820
But I could have sworn
it was her.

1872
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:35,490
I reaIIy thought it was ArIena!

1873
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,740
Yes. But even so, it was you
who told to me Iater

1874
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:40,160
that you detected a certain
paIeness beneath the tan.

1875
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:42,830
It was
because the tan was fake!

1876
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,380
<i>Oui.</i>

1877
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:48,840
<i>And you departed with great
haste to find help, huh,</i>

1878
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,380
<i>leaving as you thought</i>

1879
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:52,930
<i>Patrick Redfern
alone with the body.</i>

1880
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,970
She's gone.

1881
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:58,220
<i>POlROT: As soon as you were
out of sight,</i>

1882
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,100
<i>Monsieur and Madame Redfern
were able to put into action</i>

1883
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:03,480
<i>the next part of their plan.</i>

1884
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,240
<i>Christine Redfern
now returns to the ladder.</i>

1885
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,450
<i>She drops there the spectades</i>

1886
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,120
<i>that she has stolen
from Lionel Marshall.</i>

1887
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,120
<i>She knows that he has been
contemplating murder,</i>

1888
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:22,160
and that he wiII be impIicated

1889
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,830
<i>Et bien,</i>

1890
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,960
to the rest of the world,
ArIena Stuart is aIready dead
,

1891
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:30,880
and both Monsieur
and Madame Redfern

1892
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:33,340
have the aIibis that
are beyond dispute
.

1893
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:37,470
But for ArIena Stuart,
her death,

1894
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,850
it is stiII to come.

1895
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:42,140
ArIena?

1896
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,390
DarIing?

1897
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,440
I'm here.

1898
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,190
Has she gone?
Christine was here.

1899
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,360
I did what you told me
and hid in the cave
.

1900
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,530
Forget Christine now.

1901
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,040
The beautifuI ArIena.

1902
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,960
She was an actress
most accompIished
,

1903
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:14,090
but a woman most susceptibIe.

1904
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,130
Men preyed
on her for her money.

1905
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:17,640
Men Iike the American,

1906
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,640
Mr Nathan LIoyd but it was
.,
Monsieur Patrick Redfern

1907
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,980
who tempted her most of aII
.

1908
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,900
Who better to suggest a scheme
of investment for her money

1909
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:28,690
than a journaIist
who worked on the city pages

1910
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,320
of the newspapers?

1911
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,490
And so she gives to him
aII of her money to invest.

1912
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:36,150
But, of course, there was
no such scheme.

1913
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:40,370
And from that moment
,

1914
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,490
her fate it was seaIed
,.

1915
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,960
JAPP: He takes the money,

1916
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,620

.

1917
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,420
<i>Oui, c'est ça,</i>
Chief Inspector.

1918
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:54,090
And from now the rest
,,,
it is very simpIe.

01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:58,550
<i>Christine Redfern
returns to the hotel.</i>

1920
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:02,470
<i>With great haste, she takes
off her outer dothing,</i>

1921
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,560
<i>And there now needs only
to be removed from her body</i>

1922
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:09,400
<i>the make-up that is brown.</i>

1923
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,230
<i>So, she must take a bath.</i>

1924
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,320
<i>And it is this</i>

1925
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:22,990

<i>And neither Monsieur

1929
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,260
<i>could possibly
have committed the murder.</i>

1930
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,220
HeIIo.

1931
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,300
- No, exactIy on time.
- EMILY: Mr. Poirot!

1932

I've ever heard.

1937
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:59,320
Yes, Chief Inspector, it was
,?
indeed unique huh

1938
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:04,200
For the murder it was committed
,
after the time of her death.

1939
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,830
But this was not
the first occasion

1940
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:09,580
that they had effected
such a scheme.

1941
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:11,420

murdered for her money.

1944
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,710
But this time, by a fiancé

possibIy have been there.
