it's such a kick to meet

the famous Hercule Poirot.

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,690
uncle Arthur's told me
masses about you, of course.

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,490
Have you been working on
a case in Baghdad?

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,030
It's quite interesting actually.

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,990
Poirot got a telegram
from an old flame of his

13
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
saying she was
in a spot of bother

14

in Baghdad

to Monsieur Coleman.

Her father's a superintendent
in the Baghdad police.

He must be up at the dig

He doesn't approve of Sheila
coming out here alone.

31

What ho, Sheila?

32
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,660
Will you take that

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,210
It may have escaped your notice
that you're in a car

Thank you, Hastings.

39
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,750
I say, Poirot,
was that tactless of me,

00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,120
mentioning the countess?

41
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,960
Could you ever
be tactless, Hastings?

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,880

I mean, she books

passing through, as it were.

I put it on that shelf there.

Captain Hastings,
move those querns

142

Madam Leidner,
what is a quern?

LEIDNER: Where's Mr Mercado

146
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,060

Monsieur Poirot.

155
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
We're very distressed about
the poor Arab who was killed

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,930
<i>Oui.</i>

It is a circumstance most
unfortunate Madame Leidner

Was he one of your workmen?

159
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,020
It's hard to say
,

160
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,070
we have so many
casual workers.

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh God

162
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,490
It's all right, Joseph.

163
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,410
ANNIE: What's wrong,
.?
Mr Mercado

164
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,280
- It's all right.
- Sorry.

165
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,140
I was reading in my
guide book last night

166
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,180
why this bit of Iraq
used to be called Mesopotamia
.

167
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,350
Apparently, it's Greek
for "between two rivers."

168
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,060
I mean, you know
hippopotamuses --

169
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,360
well, "hippo" means river,
and "potamus" means horse
,

170
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,150
river-horse, you see.

171
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,240
No, er...

172
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,610
it's the other way around
,
isn't it?

173
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,450
"Hippo" means horse,

174
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,830
and "potamus" means river;

175
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,120
otherwise, it would be
"between two horses."

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,250
So, as "meso" apparently
means "between,"

177
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,130
Mesopotamia means
"between two rivers."

178
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,800
Er...

And it's almost undamaged
.
Look.

356
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,070
JOSEPH: I find their pottery
crude

357
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,070
compared to the Egyptians
.

358
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh no Mr Mercado
,,.,

359
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,780
unsophisticated perhaps --
,

360
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,200
JOSEPH: Oh my God!
,

361
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,410
MRS. LEIDNER: Sergeant!
Sergeant!

362
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,290
[Grunting]

363
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,550
Are you all right,
Captain Hastings?

364
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,810
Yes, I'm okay.

365
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,060
What was all that about,
.?
Mr Mercado

366
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,480
,?
Well why do you ask me

367
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,940
The man is mad
,
obviously.

368
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,520
He said he was going
to avenge his brother.

369
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,940
What brother?

370
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,690
I do not know any brother
.

371
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,790
What kind of a place
have I come to?

372
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,040
For years I've Iived in fear
,
of being murdered
.

373
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,790
You can't mean it.

374
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,830
I assure you,
Captain Hastings,

375
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
that I do
.

376
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,460
But murdered by whom
,
?
Madame Leidner

377
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,380
When I was a girl of 20,

378
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,220
I married a young man
in our State Department --

379
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,050
Frederick Bosner
.

380
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,060
[Bells ringing]

381
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,520
I hardly knew him I suppose
,.

382
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,560
It was one of those foolish
wartime marriages.

383
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,360
We'd only been married
a few days

384
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,860
and he went away
.

385
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,280
I never saw him again.

386
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,740
Frederick was killed in the war
,

387
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,290
but he was killed
in America.

388
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,870
He was shot as a spy.

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
It was...

390
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,370
terrible...

391
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,920
terrible.

392
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,460
And then about
,
three months later,

393
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,050
an amazing thing happened
.

394
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,180
HASTINGS: "I am waiting for you.

395
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,600
If you ever marry another man,
I will kill you.

396
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,760
Signed Frederick "
.

397
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,220
But this purports to come
from your husband who is dead
.

398
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,850
Exactly.

399
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,770
I thought I was mad
or dreaming
.

400
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,190
Eventually,
I went to my father.

401
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,650
He worked in
the State Department, too.

402
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,570
He admitted the truth --

403
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,530
my husband hadn't
been shot at all,

404
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,700
he'd escaped
.

405
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,450
The State Department
had covered it all up anyway
,

406
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,330
and he was trying to protect me
.

407
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,370
[Men shrieking]

408
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,380
But then Frederick
had been killed

409
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,260
in a train wreck
a few weeks after his escape,

410
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,590
and he saw no reason to burden
me with the knowledge
.

411
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,890
I shouldn't have told you this
,

412
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,810
I just thought you were
someone I could talk to
,

413
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,100
a comparative stranger
just here for a few days.

414
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,770
And you say now that
you have received

415
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,270
more of these letters?

416
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,780
Some years ago when I
got engaged to be married
,

417
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,320
a whole flurry
of letters started
.

418
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,830
I couldn't bear it
.

419
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,460
I broke off the engagement.

420
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,790
It seemed that every time
I became

421
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,000
even friendly
with another man,

422
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,960
I was warned off
.

423
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,340
And then there was
silence for years.

424
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,220
I met Eric and we got engaged
,.

425
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,560
Nothing.

426
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,890
We married
.

427
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,730
Nothing.

428
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,650
And then three weeks ago
,

429
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,360
I got this.

430
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,200
"I have arrived "
.

431
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,530
But if this isn't
your former husband
,

432
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,780
who is it?

433
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,870
I don't know
.

434
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,000
Frederick had a much younger
brother named William.

435
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,000
He was an unstable child
,

436
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,630
but he adored Frederick
.

437
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,670
Perhaps he feels that any
involvement

438
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,590
I have with another man
is somehow betraying

439
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,050
his brother's memory.

440
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,350
And this William Bosner
,

441
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,430
you think that for this,

442
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,270
he might still be seeking
the vengeance?

443
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,310
[Sighs]

444
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,020
The same night
I received that
...

445
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,730
I saw the face
at that window
.

446
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,940
No!

447
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,030
For the first time.

448
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,030
No!

449
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,570
A dead face
.

450
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,170
HASTINGS: I really don't
unclerstand

451
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,340
why you're leaving,
Poirot.

452
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,420
After all Mrs Leidner
.
told us this morning
,

453
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,720
I mean to say, there's
a damsel in distress

454
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,970
if you like.

455
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,100
We're all in bally
distress this year
.

456
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,470
You wouldn't believe
what a difference there is
.

457
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,520
There's Carey.

458
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,520
Even he was quite cheerful
last year...

459
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,270
believe it or not.

460
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,690
He's worked with Leidner
for years, of course.

461
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,480
So has Annie Johnson.

462
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,610
She blames Mrs Leidner
.,

463
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,030
thinks her presence
spoils everything.

464
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,070
Is that your opinion,
Monsieur Coleman?

465
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,490
No, she's just jealous.

466
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,370
She used to run round
after old Leidner
,

467
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,790
darning his socks and making him
tea in the old days.

468
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,290
I suppose she feels
a bit inhibited

469
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,340
with Mrs Leidner around
..

470
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,000
- Ah.
- Whoops.

471
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,010
- Oof!
- That was a good one!

472
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,260
We don't have to get there
in five minutes, you know.

473
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,680
Oh, that's half the fun
of this run.

474
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,010
You're getting old
,
uncle Arthur.

475
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,350
POIROT: Speaking for myself,

476
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,350
Monsieur Coleman,
I have aged 10 years

477
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,060
since I entered
this automobile.

478
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,060
[Chuckles]

479
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,810
It's none of your
damn business how I behave
.

480
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,150
Of course it's my business.

481
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,360
Now, you listen to me,
Mr. Richard Carey --

482
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,860
ERIC: Oh, there you are, Louise.

483
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,280
I thought Miss Johnson

484
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,490
might be up here.

485
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,030
She's just going out
to the dig.

486
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,240
Oh good
,.

487
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,740
I'll try and catch her
.

488
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,090
,?
How you doing there Richard

489
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,750
I'll give you a hand
.

490
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,890
[Vendor yells]

491
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,620
I'll post those letters now.

492
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,750
Thank you.

493
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,880
Oh, tell me,
Monsieur Coleman,

494
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,630
do you recognize
?
this handwriting

495
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,420
COLEMAN:
It's the lovely Louise's.

496
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,630
?
Madame Leidner

497
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,670
Yes. Why?

498
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,090
Oh, nothing.

499
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,010
It just reminded me
of the handwriting

500
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,010
that I saw recently
of someone else.

501
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,180
Good Lord
.

502
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,000
Why would she write threatening
letters to herself?

503
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh I think that would
,
be an assumption

504
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,630
too great to make, Hastings,

505
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,000
on the grounds of the similarity
of the handwritings
.

506
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,550
But if it was so,

507
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,840
it would not be
an occurrence unheard
.

508
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,550
Pretty ruddy silly
,
if you ask me.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,970
Ah, well, if only people
would ask you Hastings
,,

510
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,430
they would refrain
,?
from the ruddy silliness eh

511
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
Good night Hastings
,.

512
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,020
Good night Poirot
,.

513
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,200
Monsieur.

514
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,240
The key to my room,
if you please.

515
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,950
Certainly,
Monsieur Poirot.

516
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,910
The Countess Rossakoff,

517
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,200
she is returned
yet to the hotel?

518
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,710
Not yet,
Monsieur Poirot.

519
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,250
Oh. <i>Merci.</i>

520
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,790
Hello Richard
,.

521
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,630
Hello, Sheila.
You're a long way from home.

522
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,130
If Mohammed won't go
to the mountain...

523
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,090
Why do you never
?
come into Baghdad

524
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,600
There's nothing in Baghdad
that interests me particularly.

525
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,510
Really?

526
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,890
- I'm sure we could --
- Sheila.

527
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,480
Don't say another word
.

528
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,520
I am very nearly old enough

529
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,810
to be your father.

530
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,480
I wasn't
saying anything.

531
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,360
I don't know what

And the only way to that door
is through the courtyard,

Why do you think Mercado
was so upset?

He's a rum cove,
I must say.

And you send not for the police
,

711
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,280
or not even for
a private detective
,

712
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,120
but for a nurse.

713
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,910
I thought...

714
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,750
I...

715
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,330
POIROT: You see doctor
,,
it all rings,

716
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,880
except for that one thing.

717
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,050
Why a nurse?

718
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,840
Well, there is an answer,

719
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,470
in fact, there can only be
one answer --

720
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,510
that you did not truly
believe that your wife,

721
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,350
she was in danger
.

722
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,350
God help me
.

723
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,230
I didn't
.

724
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,940
Doctor did you suspect
,
that your wife

725
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,610
wrote those letters herself?

726
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,410
I thought that maybe

727
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,750
worrying and brooding
over the past

728
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,830
might have possibly
affected her mind.

729
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,630
I thought that she might have

730
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,550
somehow written those
letters to herself

731
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,760
without being consdous
of having done so.

732
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,390
That is possible, isn't it?

733
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,810
There are, as I see it,
three possibilities.

734
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,400
Three?

735
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,730
<i>Oui.</i>

736
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,610
Solution number one --

737
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,990
and the simplest --

738
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,200
William Bosner,
the young, unstable brother

739
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,740
of the first husband
of Madame Leidner
,

740
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,950
still seeks the vengeance.

741
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
First, he threatens her
and then

742
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,750
he carries out his threats.

743
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,750
But if we accept this solution,

744
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,290
then we have the problem
of how he entered and departed

745
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,550
without being observed
.

746
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,340
?
And the second

747
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,420
Solution number two --

748
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,550
that for reasons
of her own,

749
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,050
Madame Leidner writes
to herself those letters

750
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,600
that are most threatening.

751
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,270
I thought that was
the idea you favored
.

752
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,230
But if this was true,

753
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,350
then the letters, they have
nothing to do with the murder
.

754
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,400
But now we come to
solution number three,

755
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,530
and to my mind
,
the most interesting.

756
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,200
I suggest the letters,
they are genuine.

757
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,870
That they are written
by William Bosner,

758
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,910
the young brother-in-law
of Madame Leidner
,

759
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,080
and that actually he is one
of the staff of the expedition
.

760
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,880
Excuse me.

761
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,340
LAVIGNY: I joined the expedition
only about a month ago,

762
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,050
from the order of
the Pères Blancs of Carthage.

763
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,720
POIROT: And before your arrival
here, <i>mon Père,</i>

764
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,140
did you at any time make
the acquaintance

765
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,730
?
with Madame Leidner

766
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,980
No.

767
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,940
I'd never seen the Iady
until I met her here.

768
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,360
The other day
,

769
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,450
Captain Hastings saw you
talk to a man outside
,

770
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,490
and yet previously
,,
this very same man

771
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,740
had been seen trying to peer in
at one of the windows.

772
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,990
HASTINGS: It looked
as if he was

773
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,240
hanging around the place
deliberately
.

774
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,370
That's what I thought.

775
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,620
I asked him what he was doing
and told him to go away.

776
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
<i>Bon.</i>

777
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,590
MAITLAND: Father Lavigny
is out of the question --

778
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,930
he's a well known man.

779
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,350
Anyway he only joined
,
the expedition last month
.

780
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,180
I happened to take
the telegram

781
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,560
from Dr. Leidner
asking him to join

782
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,810
into Baghdad
and sent it myself
.

783
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,100
Dr Byrd had been taken ill
.,
had to go back to Boston.

784
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,520
But you do not appreciate

785
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,270
the point of importance,
Superintendent.

786
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
If it is William Bosner
who has done this thing
,

787
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,030
where has he been
all these years?

788
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,700
He must have taken
a different name,

789
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,780
he must have built up for
himself a career.

790
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,230
The Countess Rossakoff?

791
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,940
I'm afraid not
,
Monsieur Poirot.

792
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,190
Good night
.

793
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,320
I didn't even know Mrs Leidner
.
had been married before.

794
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,950
Oh, yes, American.

795
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Went to the bad
during the war.

796
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,380
I just wonder what's going
to happen to the expedition now
.

797
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,460
It's very much Leidner's show --

798
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,880
Sorry to interrupt.

799
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,760
Have either of you seen
Miss Johnson?

800
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,920
She wasn't at dinner
,

801
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,680
she's not in her
room either.

802
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,760
You don't think she's made off

803
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,840
with the family silver,
do you?

804
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,760
No, of course not.

805
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,350
I just...

806
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,140
well, you know,
with a murderer about
...

807
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,740
[Woman crying]

808
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,080
[Loud sobbing]

809
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,170
What's all this?

810
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,340
You mustn't sit here crying,
all by yourself.

811
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,470
Don't Miss Johnson don't
,,.

812
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,260
Take a hold on yourself
.

813
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,180
What's upset you,
Miss Johnson?

814
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,520
It's just...

815
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,770
it's all so awful.

816
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,190
Now, you mustn't start

817
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,560
thinking about it again.

818
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,320
What's happened has happened
and can't be mended.

819
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,690
It's no use fretting, you know.

820
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,700
No.

821
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,450
You're right, nurse.

822
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,120
I'm making a fool
of myself.

823
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,870
It all came over me suddenly
.

824
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,370
Yes.

825
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,170
Yes, I know.

826
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,460
A good night's sleep
is what you need.

827
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,090
Yes.

828
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,920
Thank you, nurse.

829
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,550
You're a nice kind
,,
sensible woman.

830
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,440
It's not often
I make such a fool of myself.

831
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,080
ANNIE: She was never
a nice woman.

832
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,080
Give that to me.

833
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,960
Any sign of the Countess
yet, Poirot?

834
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,040
No, no.

835
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,800
And to tell you the truth
,
Hastings,

836
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,340
I begin to fear
for her safety.

837
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,550
First, there was the telegram

838
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,340
stressing her need of help
most urgently,

839
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,430
then her absence from
the hotel at my arrival,

840
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,800
and now the continuing lack

841
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,810
of any sort of
communication from her.

842
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,600
Yes, I see what you mean.

843
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,520
<i>Bonjour,</i>
Mademoiselle Maitland
.

844
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,860
<i>Bonjour</i> distinguished
<i>,</i>
Belgian 'tec.

845
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,320
You see, Hastings,

846
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,610
people begin to remember
that I am not French.

847
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,410
POIROT: It is good of
you to come,

848
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,240
<i>ma soeur.</i>

849
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,660
It is most interesting
and important this news

850
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,960
of Mademoiselle Johnson
.

851
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,500
<i>Asseyez-vous, s'il vous plaît.</i>

852
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,880
Mademoiselle
.

853
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,260
She must have murdered
Mrs Leidner
..

854
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,890
Well why else would she
,
burn that paper?

855
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,140
The writing was exactly like

856
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,720
the rest of the anonymous
letters.

857
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,520
Yes, yes, Nurse Leatheran,
but order and method, eh?

858
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,980
There is first
a great deal

859
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,610
that you have to tell me.

860
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,190
Now I could not ask you
,
at Tell Yarimjah,

861
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,860
but the good Doctor Leidner
,
he worshipped his wife
.

862
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,990
And he is sure
that everybody else

863
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,740
felt exactly
the same towards her
.

864
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,950
But in my opinion,

865
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,830
that would not be
human nature.

866
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,830
No, no, no.
It is necessary for us

867
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,580
to discuss Madam Leidner with --
?
how do you say

868
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,920
,?
The gloves removed eh

869
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,800
So...

870
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,340
who was there
on the expedition

871
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,880
who did not like
?
Madam Leidner

872
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,140
Oh...

873
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,470
Well, it's only my opinion.

874
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,390
<i>Naturellement.</i>

875
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,850
Well...

876
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,890
in my opinion,

877
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,690
little Mrs Mercado
.
really hated her.

878
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,360
POIROT: Ah.

879
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,570
And, er...
?
Monsieur Mercado

880
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,610
Well, he was a bit soft
on her, if anything.

881
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,910
Mrs Leidner had a nice
.,

882
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,070
kind way of being
interested in people
.

883
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,330
It rather went to Mr Mercado's
.
head, I fancy.

884
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,200
Mrs Mercado wouldn't have been
.
too pleased about that.

885
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,370
I've seen her look
at Mrs. Leidner

886
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,630
as though she'd like
to kill her.

887
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,590
Oh.

888
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,550
I didn't mean to say
...

889
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,350
I mean, she --

890
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,810
No, no, no.

891
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,980
I unclerstand
.

892
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,060
What about Monsieur Carey?

893
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,270
Well...

894
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,570
he was always
very stiff with her.

895
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,030
And her with him
.

896
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,950
Perhaps he was jealous
like Miss Johnson,

897
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,290
him being an old friend
of her husband's, too.

898
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,540
What ho, Sheila?

899
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,370
Look here --
I've bought two tickets

900
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,670
for the tennis dub dance
.

901
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,380
That's not until the end
of next month.

902
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,380
I know.

903
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,010
I wanted to get in
before anyone else.

904
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,090
Will you come?

905
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,590
Oh, all right.

906
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,010
Yes I'd love to
,.

907
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,680
What is your opinion
of the younger man, Hastings?

908
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,230
William Coleman,
for instance?

909
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,230
I say steady on Poirot
,,,
he's my nephew.

910
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,110
No, he's your nephew
by adoption Hastings
,.

911
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,070
Yes, but all the same.

912
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,690
How old was he
when he was adopted

913
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,280
by your sister
?
and her husband

914
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,570
Oh, er, eight or nine.

915
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,410
His parents died
shortly after the war.

916
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,330
They were some sort of distant
cousins of Harry Coleman.

917
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,540
And where was that
,
Hastings?

918
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,620
In America, actually.

919
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,630
Bill had the most peculiar
American accent when...

920
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,130
I say...

921
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,550
No.

922
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,550
You know well we must consider
every possibility, Hastings.

923
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,430
Good Lord
.

924
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,600
How are you getting on
with our local mystery?

925
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,940
I've learned a great deal
,
mademoiselle,

926
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,610
about our victim.

927
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,440
And very often the victim,
it is the due to the mystery.

928
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,450
That's rather dever of you,
Mr. Poirot.

929
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,910
<i>Merci</i> mademoiselle
<i>,</i>.

930
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,910
It's certainly true

931
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,620
that if ever a woman deserved
to be murdered,

932
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,830
Mrs Leidner was that woman
..

933
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,960
Miss Maitland!

934
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,580
Nurse Leatheran I'm afraid
,,
was quite taken in by her,

935
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,330
as many other people were.

936
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,960
What Sheila's telling you,
Monsieur Poirot,

937
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,550
take it with a pinch of salt.

938
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,220
She and Louise Leidner
didn't exactly hit it off.

939
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,130
We didn't hit it off
because Louise knew

940
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,340
that I saw through her.

941
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,010
In fact I wouldn't
,
have much objected

942
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,760
to putting her
out of the way myself.

943
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,430
Then for the time of death
of Madam Leidner Mademoiselle
,,

944
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,600
I hope you have a good alibi
.

945
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,060
Alibi?

946
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,400
I was playing tennis
at the dub.

947
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,400
You can ask anybody
.

948
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,610
I was always taught
you don't speak ill of the dead
.

949
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,780
Oh that's stupid!
,

950
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,320
The truth's
always the truth.

951
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,110
Louise Leidner
was the sort of woman

952
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,200
who wanted to break things up
just for fun,

953
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,530
for the sense of power.

954
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,290
And she was the kind of woman
who had to get ahold

955
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,660
of every male creature
within reach.

956
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,080
Have you told them
?
about Richard Carey

957
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,620
About Mr. Carey?

958
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,210
Well I've mentioned
,
that they

959
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,590
didn't hit it off very well
.

960
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,130
?
"Didn't hit it off very well"
You idiot!

961
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,220
He's head over heels
in love with her.

962
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,690
[Speaking Arabic]

963
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,620
Tell me, Hastings,
Monsieur Mercado --

964
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,910
is he right-handed
?
or left-handed

965
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,120
Um right-handed I think
,,.

966
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,870
Yes.

967
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,120
[Panting]

968
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,880
Ah, <i>bonjour,</i>
Monsieur Mercado
.

969
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,500
Good morning
.

970
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,840
Not many people
visit me out here.

971
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,800
You dig too deep monsieur
,,

972
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,050
it is very difficult
on the legs you unclerstand
,.

973
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,850
These people
must have been jolly fit.

974
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,060
JOSEPH: The lower you get,

975
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,180
the more interesting it becomes.

976
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,520
Follow me, gentlemen.

977
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,310
One interesting thing

978
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,730
is that the pottery
found above this level
,

979
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,900
it shows a marked difference
.

980
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,110
Here, I will show you.

981
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,780
If you look at this piece --

982
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,990
Agh!

983
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,370
Something stung me.

984
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,580
A scorpion, perhaps?

985
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,990
<i>Vite!</i>

986
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,160
<i>Merde, voilà.</i>

987
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,460
JOSEPH: I knew
I felt something.

988
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,090
But it is not
a scorpion, though,

989
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,670
or it would
be already swollen
.

990
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,050
But one cannot be

991
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,550
too careful, eh,
?
Monsieur Mercado

992
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,730
[Grunts]

993
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,440
Whoa!

994
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
That was neat,
eh, Hastings?

995
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:44,730
What was that, Poirot?

996
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,730
?
Did you do that

997
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,490
<i>Oui.</i>

998
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,950
I was the stinging insect
and very neatly I did it too
,.

999
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,070
<i>Regarde.</i>

1000
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,700
You did not see me eh
,,
Hastings?

1001
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,700
But what for?

1002
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:04,460
I wished to observe
his forearm, Hastings.

1003
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,460
The left one.

1004
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,590
?
Did you not notice anything

1005
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,420
Well, yes, I did,
as a matter of fact.

1006
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,170
- A lot of marks on the skin.
<i>- Oui.</i>

1007
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,840
I suspected but now
,
I had to be sure.

1008
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,550
Monsieur Mercado he is addicted
,
to drugs, Hastings.

1009
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,810
I see.

1010
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,930
?
So where does that Iead us

1011
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,230
For the moment, I cannot say.

1012
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:28,570
But facts, Hastings, facts,

1013
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,400
those are the cobbles
that make up the road

1014
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,400
along which we travel.

1015
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,700
Poirot wants to see
if Miss Johnson

1016
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,700
could really have heard
Mrs. Leidner call out

1017
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,790
when she was murdered
,
you see.

1018
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,710
So if you could go
in Mrs Leidner's room
.

1019
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,580
and just give a little cry
,

1020
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,880
I'll go in the living room
and see if I hear anything
.

1021
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
All right.

1022
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,960
Oh, not a big scream
or anything.

1023
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,720
I mean,
not madly terrified
,

1024
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,720
just a little cry

1025
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,550
as if you stubbed your
toe or something.

1026
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,050
Yes, I see.

1027
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,120
<i>Bonjour,</i> Monsieur Carey.

1028
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,630
Ready when you are
.

1029
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,550
No I've done it
,.

1030
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,090
Oh.

1031
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,300
Well I didn't hear anything
,.

1032
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,100
Perhaps you should try it
again a bit louder.

1033
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,180
RICHARD: I'm hardly the right
person to help you --

1034
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,810
Mrs Leidner and I didn't get
.
on particularly well.

1035
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,270
I suppose I was a bit resentful
of her influence over Leidner
.

1036
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,490
We were polite to each other,
but not intimate.

1037
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,990
Hmm.

1038
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,240
Explained most admirably
,
Monsieur Carey.

1039
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,740
But there are stories
going about

1040
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,620
and one listens to these
stories and perhaps --

1041
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,330
What stories?

1042
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,130
Oh, the usual sort of story --
about you and Madame Leidner
.

1043
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,090
[Scoffs]

1044
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,260
What foul minds
people have.

1045
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,340
<i>Vraiment.</i>

1046
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,220
,?
They're dogs huh

1047
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,430
However deep one buries
an unpleasantness,

1048
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:25,220
a dog he will always
,
root it out again.

1049
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,060
As for myself I'm always ready
,
to be convinced of the truth
.

1050
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,940
You? Ha ha!

1051
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,900
I doubt if you'd know the truth
if you heard it.

1052
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,730
Hmm.

1053
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,820
Try me and see
.

1054
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,870
All right.

1055
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,950
I hated Louise Leidner
.

1056
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,370
That's the truth for you.

1057
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,960
That's the truth.

1058
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,260
We tried it several times,
getting Iouder and Iouder
.

1059
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,510
Even when Nurse Leatheran
screamed quite IoudIy,

1060
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,560
you couIdn't hear it

The onIy way we heard it

1064
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,520
was when we tried it
with the window open
.

1065
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,020
The window to the room
of Madame Leidner?

Yes.

Oh, she's aII right.

1078
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,640
Of course, she's the onIy
young creature in the pIace,

1079
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,100
so she gets a bit spoiIt
by aII the young men

1080
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,520
dancing attendance on her --

1081
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,360
not that she doesn't
encourage them.

1082
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,020

yesterday afternoon

1083

got Iost, of course.

1090

And Père Lavigny he transIates
,
them, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1091
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,590
WeII, there's not usuaIIy
much to transIate,

1092
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,300
they're more pictoriaI,
aIthough that varies

1093
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,550
from age to age.

1094
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,720

a short inscription --

1095
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,470
just by the picture.

1096
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,060
It's probabIy the name
of the owner.

I'm just doing the moId

1102
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,780

1103
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,070

.

1104

01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,560
WeII she said she wanted
,
to think it out.

1406
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Yes, and that is what signed
her death warrant Hastings
,.

1407
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:45,900
If onIy she had toId us
.

1408
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,150
[Whimpering]

1409
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,030
What is it,
?
mademoiseIIe

1410
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,610
The window!

1411
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:02,080
Oh, Hastings,

1412
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,160
what a fooI
that I have been --

1413
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,580
when the truth,
it is so dear,

1414
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,710
so simpIe.

1415
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,750
I have said severaI times

1416
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,710
in the course of this
investigation

1417
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,710
that this case revoIved around

1418
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,260
the personaIity
of Madame Leidner
.

1419
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,920
Now, it became
quite dear to me

1420
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,300
that Madame Leidner was a woman

1421
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:01,390
endowed by nature
,
not onIy with beauty,

1422
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,970
but with a kind of magic

1423
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,100
that was caIamitous,

1424
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,100
that can sometimes
accompany beauty.

1425
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,690
And such women can often
bring disaster --

1426
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,320
sometimes on others
and sometimes

1427
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,820
on themseIves.

1428
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,580
Madame Leidner was very young
when she first married

1429
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,750
a Monsieur Frederick Bosner
,

1430
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,040
but she was widowed
most tragicaIIy

1431
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:32,500
very soon after the wedding
.

1432
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:36,670
It was at this time that she
began to receive Ietters

1433
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,010
that were anonymous
and most threatening
,

1434
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,060
but which she suspected
as coming from WiIIiam Bosner,

1435
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,730
the young brother
of her Iate husband
.

1436
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,390
Over the years,

1437
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,350
every time she becomes

1438
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,360
invoIved romanticaIIy
with a man,

1439
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,190
a Ietter most threatening
and anonymous,

1440
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,450
it wouId arrive
and the affair
...

1441
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:00,820
it comes to nothing.

1442
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:04,330
But then there appears
on the scene...

1443
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:05,910
Dr Leidner hmm
.,.

1444
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,160
And no such Ietter arrives
.

1445
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:12,250
They faII in Iove,
they become engaged
,

1446
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,960
and stiII no Ietter
.

1447
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:17,630
SuddenIy nothing stands
,
in the way of Madame Bosner

1448
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,930
becoming Madame Leidner
.

1449
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:24,260
Why?

1450
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,270
And why then did
such a Ietter arrive

1451
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,890
after the wedding
with Dr. Leidner

1452
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,890
?
when she arrived here

1453
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,610
This is history, Poirot.

1454
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:34,900
<i>Oui, d'accord, mon ami,</i>

1455
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,490
but history of
the importance extreme.

1456
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:41,150
But now Superintendent
,,
I wiII come to the present

1457
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,410
and a consideration most
particuIar

1458
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,660
of the entourage
of Madame Leidner
.

1459
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,080
On the face of it,

1460
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,290
any one of them may have
committed a murder
.

1461
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,000
Look here, that's absoIute rot.

1462
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,250
No, no, no,
Monsieur CoIeman,

1463
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,420
it is not the rot.

1464
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:03,050
<i>Alors,</i> the first person to
consider was Père Lavigny
...

1465
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,840
who now of course has fIed
,,,

1466
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:07,760
but reveaIed himseIf to be
a thief and a forger

1467
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,350
of the antiquities
archaeoIogicaI, hmm,

1468
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:12,850
but not I think a murderer
,,.

1469
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:15,110
AIso there are
three persons

1470
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,230
who have the aIibis
that are watertight --

1471
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,940
Dr Leidner
.,

1472
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:22,490
who never Ieft the roof;

1473
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,700
Monsieur Richard Carey
,

1474
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,080
who was working at the dig;

1475
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,660
and Monsieur CoIeman
,
who was in Baghdad
.

1476
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:32,000
But even these aIibis,

1477
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,670
<i>mes amis</i> are not as good
<i>,</i>
as they seem, hmm?

1478
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:38,210
<i>Non,</i> oh, except that
of Dr. Leidner.

1479
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,880
There is no doubt
that Dr Leidner
.

1480
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,380
was on the roof
aII of the time

1481
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,470
and onIy descended
Iong after the murder
,

1482
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,100
it had happened
.

1483
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:51,180
But now it is necessary
for us to pause for a moment...

1484
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,770
to consider
...

1485
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:56,400
MademoiseIIe MaitIand
.

1486
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,820
Now MademoiseIIe MaitIand
,

1487
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,650
was very open with me
concerning

1488
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,900
her feeIings for Madame Leidner
.

1489
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,150
We didn't hit it off

1490
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,110
because Louise knew
that I saw through her.

1491
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,870
In fact I wouIdn't
,
have much objected

1492
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,700
to putting her
out of the way myseIf.

1493
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,580
Then for the time of death
of Madame Leidner
,

1494
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,540
MademoiseIIe I hope you
,
have a good aIibi.

1495
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:18,540
AIibi? I was pIaying tennis
at the dub.

1496
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:19,710
You can ask anybody
.

1497
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,300
POIROT: But was that true?

1498
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,800
Of course, she's the onIy young
creature in the pIace,

1499
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,720
so she gets spoiIt
by aII the young men

1500
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,970
dancing attendance on her --

1501
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,220
not that she doesn't
encourage them.

1502
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,770
She was out here yesterday
afternoon

1503
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,480
Iooking around
for one or other of them.

1504
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,640
POIROT: I heard something

1505
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,400
very different
in a conversation most casuaI

1506
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,940
that I had with
MademoiseIIe Johnson
.

1507
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,240
AII right,

1508
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,820
I rode out to
the dig after Iunch
.

1509
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,240
Then why did you not say so,
,?
MademoiseIIe when I asked you

1510
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,620
I couIdn't
.

1511
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,950
Daddy doesn't Iike me
coming out here by myseIf.

1512
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,910
But it's so boring in Baghdad
.

1513
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,670
You don't know what it's Iike
.

1514
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:59,630
But you do admit that you
did not Iike Madame Leidner
.

1515
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,290
WeII I don't Iike
,
a Iot of peopIe,

1516
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,050
but I don't go around
murdering them.

1517
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,050
I just rode out here because
I wanted someone to taIk to
.

1518
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,550
I wasn't far
from the expedition house

1519
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,180
when I saw the expedition car
drawn up in a wadi.

1520
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:16,520
I thought it was rather queer,
and then I saw Mr CoIeman
..

1521
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,190
POIROT: Did you speak
with Monsieur CoIeman?

1522
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,480
- No.
- Why not?

1523
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:23,940
He was Iooking very
furtive.

1524
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,740
It gave me
an unpIeasant feeIing.

1525
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,150
I know it Iooks a bit fishy,

1526
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,320
but I've got a perfectIy
good expIanation
.

1527
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:32,830
Mr Mercado had given me
.
a joIIy fine cyIinder seaI

1528
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:35,080
to take back to the antica.

1529
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,960
I put it in my jacket pocket,
went for a waIk,

1530
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,960
and forgot aII about it
.

1531
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,670
The next day,
I discovered it had gone
.

1532
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:43,290
I must have dropped it
when I took my jacket off

1533
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,210
as I was waIking aIong
that wadi.

1534
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,050
I rushed aII my business
in Baghdad

1535
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,930
and spent an hour
searching for it.

1536
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,970
POIROT: And so
...

1537
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,430
the behavior
of Monsieur WiIIiam CoIeman

1538
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,970
on the day of the murder
was indeed certainIy suspidous
.

1539
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,190
But I do not think
that Monsieur CoIeman,

1540
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,400
as Monsieur CoIeman,

1541
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,520
has the temperament
of a murderer.

1542
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:05,230
No.

1543
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,240
But there is nothing here
to veto the idea

1544
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,280
that his personaIity,
which is most cheery,

1545
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,830
might conceaI the hidden one
of Monsieur WiIIiam Bosner.

1546
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:18,710
Why aII of you Iisten
to this chap beats me.

1547
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,420
MademoiseIIe MaitIand
,

1548
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,920
when you arrived at the dig
,

1549
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:25,960
?
did you see anyone

1550
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:28,550
None of the expedition
members, no.

1551
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,380
There seemed to be no one
there but the Arab foreman.

1552
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:33,050
<i>Shufta</i> Mr. Carey?

1553
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,180
<i>Shufta inak. lnak!</i>

1554
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,060
You did not even see
Monsieur Carey?

1555
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,770
AII right yes I did
,,,

1556
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:40,980
for a few moments --

1557
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,980
near the dig
.

1558
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,730
- I'm sure we couId --
- SheiIa,

1559
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,980
don't say another word
.

1560
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,360
I am very nearIy oId enough

1561
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,940
to be your father.

1562
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:53,110
And you Monsieur Carey
,,

1563
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,700
did you Ieave the dig
after MademoiseIIe MaitIand
,

1564
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:57,490
?
she had departed from you

1565
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,200
Did you return towards
the house?

1566
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,210
No.

1567
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:02,170
Hmm.

1568
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,500
You see according to some
,,

1569
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,460
Monsieur Carey
and Madame Leidner
,

1570
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,050
they did not Iike one another
.

1571
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:11,630
Now, another person,
MademoiseIIe MaitIand
,

1572
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,050
propouncled a theory
that was totaIIy different

1573
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,680
to account for their attitude
of <i>la politesse frigide,</i>

1574
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,890
and Monsieur Carey himseIf toId
me something different again
.

1575
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,230
AII right!

1576
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,480
I hated Louise Leidner
.

1577
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,900
That's the truth for you!

1578
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,740
That's the truth!

1579
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:39,490
POIROT: I beIieve that he did
hate Madame Leidner
.

1580
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:44,290
?
But why did he hate her

1581
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:47,500
He was, to begin with,

1582
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:50,840
devoted to his friend
and empIoyer Dr Leidner
,.,

1583
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,180
and quite indifferent
to his wife.

1584
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:55,890
But that did not suit

1585
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,930
the temperament
of Madame Leidner no
,.

1586
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:02,430
So she set herseIf out
to trap him.

1587
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,230
And then there
occurred something I beIieve
,,

1588
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:07,190
that was totaIIy unforeseen.

1589
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,610
She feII in Iove with him,

1590
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:14,530
and he was not abIe
to resist her.

1591
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:19,330
I suspected something
of the sort very earIy on.

1592
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:22,330
And there we have the truth

1593
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,660
of the state most terribIe
of nervous tension

1594
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,000
that he has been enduring
.

1595
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,710
Oh he Ioved
,
Louise Leidner yes
,,

1596
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,670
but aIso he hated her

1597
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,260
for undermining his IoyaIty
to his friend.

1598
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:40,390
Are you accusing me of murder
,
Monsieur Poirot?

1599
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:42,430
?
You think I'd kiII Louise

1600
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,230
You fooI!

1601
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:46,140
<i>Non.</i>

1602
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:47,940
MereIy I am taking you aII

1603
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,400
on a journey towards
the truth.

1604
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,820
And I have estabIished
one fact --

1605
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:58,360
that every singIe member
of the expedition

1606
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,450
couId have committed
the murder --

1607
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:03,120
induding Nurse Leatheran
.

1608
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:06,210
I was a stranger!

1609
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:07,290
I'd onIy been here
a few weeks!

1610
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,290
<i>Eh bien, ma soeur,</i>

1611
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,790
was not that just what
?
Madame Leidner was afraid of

1612
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,670
?
A stranger from the outside

1613
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,210
And as a hospitaI nurse
,,

1614
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,970
you couId easiIy have
kiIIed Madame Leidner

1615
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,220
and MademoiseIIe Johnson
.

1616
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,470
- But...
- But I do not think that

1617
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,140
you are WiIIiam Bosner.

1618
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,550
<i>Non.</i>

1619
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,100
Of course,
there are many men

1620
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,600
who can impersonate
women most successfuIIy,

1621
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,770
but, no, it is my beIief that

1622
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:30,230
Nurse Leatheran is exactIy
what she says she is --

1623
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,480
a hospitaI nurse
of the most competent.

1624
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,150
Oh, thank you
for nothing.

1625
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,280
AII aIong,

1626
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,030
it had been in
the back of my mind

1627
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,030
that one of the members
of the expedition

1628
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,950
might have some knowIedge
that they had kept back,

1629
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,580
knowIedge that wouId
incriminate the murderer
.

1630
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:54,000
If so, this person
wouId be in danger
.

1631
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:56,380
And in this I was proved
,,
correct most tragicaIIy

1632
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,220
by the death of
MademoiseIIe Johnson
.

1633
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:02,640
POIROT: Two nights ago,

1634
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,220
when Nurse Leatheran discovered
MademoiseIIe Johnson in tears
...

1635
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:09,020
Give that to me!

1636
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,900
POIROT: The scrap of paper that
was discovered

1637
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,110
by Nurse Leatheran

1638
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,690
was burned by
MademoiseIIe Johnson
.

1639
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:21,910
It is my beIief...

1640
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:25,160
that before Nurse Leatheran
entered the room
,

1641
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,830
MademoiseIIe Johnson
had been tidying up some papers
.

1642
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,330
She must have come across
a draft that was unfinished

1643
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:36,050
of one of those Ietters
that were anonymous.

1644
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:39,970
And the handwriting
,

1645
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:41,680
it is constructed
most carefuIIy

1646
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,180
to resembIe that
of Madame Leidner
,

1647
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,890
and the kiIIer has been
careIess to Ieave it.

1648
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:52,600
But now the identity
of this kiIIer

1649
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,940
is known to
MademoiseIIe Johnson
.

1650
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,150
She cannot understand it
,

1651
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,990
it upsets her badIy
.

1652
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,990
Then on the evening
of her death,

1653
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,530
Captain Hastings and myseIf

1654
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,700
discovered MademoiseIIe Johnson
on the roof

1655
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,580
in a state of horror
most increduIous.

1656
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:11,750
I've seen how someone
couId come in from outside

1657
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:13,880
and no one wouId ever guess
.

1658
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,420
POIROT: I reaIized
that MademoiseIIe Johnson

1659
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:20,210
deIiberateIy Iooked
in the opposite direction

1660
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,550
and in order to throw
us off the scent

1661
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,180
said the very first thing
that came into her mind
.

1662
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,100
But the murderer had been
observing her doseIy,

1663
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:33,100
and reaIizes that
she knows the truth...

1664
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:35,900
so now she has to die
.

1665
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,730
[Whimpering]

1666
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,570
And that night she does so
,,

1667
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,530
but not before
she tried to heIp me
.

1668
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,610
Try to teII me!

1669
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:46,320
The wind
...

1670
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,120
- Window.
- Window!

1671
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,120
However the onIy words
,
she couId manage to articuIate

1672
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:55,580
were "the window
,
the window "
.

1673
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:00,920
MademoiseIIe Johnson
was trying to teII me

1674
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,420
what she had reaIized
on the roof that day
,

1675
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:06,340
how the murder of
Madame Leidner,

1676
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,680
it had been committed
.

1677
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:14,310
<i>Eh bien,</i> first of aII
you must aII reaIize

1678
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,270
one thing --

1679
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,860
that the window to the room
of Madame Leidner

1680
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:25,740
was on the side facing
away from the courtyard
.

1681
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,030
So...

1682
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:32,080
Madame Leidner is Iying
on her bed, haIf asIeep.

1683
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,580
The mask which has been used

1684
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,790
aIready to frighten her
in the nighttime

1685
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,210
begins to tap on the window
.

1686
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:41,500
But now she recognizes it
for what it is --

1687
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:44,720
a thing of pIaster and ink
hanging on a string.

1688
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,720
She is not frightened
,

1689
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,720
no.

1690
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,010
She opens the window

1691
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,720
and turns her face
upwards

1692
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,060
to see who is pIaying
on her the trick.

1693

[Screams]

1694
01:31:56,100 --> 01:32:00,730
Before the quern of stone
smashes down on her head

1695
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:02,440
does Madame Leidner see
,

1696
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:04,990
I wonder the face
,
?
of her murderer

1697
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,150
[Louise screams]

1698
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,570
POIROT: Her scream,

1699
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,490
it is heard
by MademoiseIIe Johnson
,

1700
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,330
who is reading
in the Iiving room,

1701
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:14,370
but heard onIy because
at this moment

1702
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,120
the window to the room
of Madame Leidner is open
,

1703
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,130
as was proved by the experiment

1704
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:22,590
most successfuI
of Captain Hastings.

1705
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:25,720
The deed accompIished

the murderer puIIs up again
the quern by the rope

01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,350
that he's attached to it

1708
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:36,310
Have I not said aII aIong

1709
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:39,600
that this was
a <i>crime passionnel?</i>

1710

that Monsieur Frederick Bosner
couId be a suspect

1716

in this case because Monsieur

to emerge from the wreck
with a new identity

1728
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:37,080
The identity of a young man

01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:19,040
He aIso keeps himseIf informed
of the movements of his wife.

1740
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,500
She shaII beIong to
no other man.

1741
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,290
And whenever he judges it
necessary,

1742
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:28,880
he dispatches a Ietter
.

1743
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,630
And he copies most carefuIIy

1744
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,800
some of the pecuIiarities
of her handwriting

1745
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,760
just in case
Madame Leidner decides

1746
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:40,560
to take to the poIice
his Ietters.

1747
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,810
But these Ietters that
are anonymous

1748
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:46,150
and threatening
,

1749
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:48,230
they do not arrive
when she meets,

1750
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,480
faIIs in Iove with,

1751
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,530
and becomes engaged
to Dr Leidner
..

1752
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,410
It is a puzzIe.

1753
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:59,120
And perhaps Madame Leidner
reaIized the answer

1754
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,370
to these puzzIements

1755
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:02,870
in the moment
before she died
.

1756
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,130
[Screams]

1757
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,300
Ah, certainIy, that is what

1758
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:10,960
MademoiseIIe Johnson
had reaIized --

1759
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:13,340
how the murder, it had
been committed from the roof
.

1760
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,390
But what MademoiseIIe Johnson
couId not have reaIized

1761
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:20,850
as Madame Leidner had done
...

1762
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:23,430
was that not onIy
was the murderer Dr Leidner
.,

1763
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,890
- whom she adored
...

1764
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:25,850
[Screams]

1765
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,570
POIROT: But that Dr Leidner
.
was indeed

1766
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:34,400
Monsieur Frederick Bosner
.

1767
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,870
He has to wait 15 years

1768
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:42,750
before the ravages of time
to his face

1769
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,080
and to the memory
of Madame Leidner

1770
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:47,630
obIiterates the oId
Frederick Bosner
.

1771
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,880
They meet and aII goes weII
.

1772
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,550
They marry...

1773
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:57,640
and aII goes weII
.

1774
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,600
UntiI into the Iife
of Madame Leidner

1775
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,430
there appears
Monsieur Richard Carey
...

1776
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:05,810
and that seaIs her fate
.

1777
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:12,400
[Scraping]

1778
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,650
It's a bit
dearer up there now.

1779
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:18,910
Louise has
been compIaining IateIy

1780
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:20,450
there's not enough room
to waIk about.

1781
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,410
I'm just going to teII her
the good news
.

1782
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:33,000
POIROT: He hurries
to the window,

1783
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,380
doses it and fastens it
,.

1784
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:41,050
He picks up and transports
the body of his wife

1785
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:44,680
to a point between the bed
and the door
.

1786
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:48,230
He then notices a sIight stain
on the rug by the window

1787
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,480
so he pIaces this rug
in front of the washstand

1788
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,400
and the rug in front
of the washstand by the window
.

1789
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:56,860
If this stain,
it is noticed
,

1790
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,900
it wiII be connected
with the washstand
.

1791
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:02,030
There must be no suggestion
that the window

1792
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,620
pIayed any part in the murder
.

1793
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh God
,.

1794
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,000
Louise!

1795
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,790
Oh, Louise!

1796
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,380
A murder most crueI and hideous
,
Dr Leidner
..

1797
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:20,590
And not content with that
...

1798
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,970
you tried to incriminate
MademoiseIIe Johnson

1799
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,140
who was good and IoyaI to you
,

1800
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,350
who was in Iove with you...

1801
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,690
by pIanting in her room...

1802
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:36,860
the very quern with which you
had kiIIed your wife
.

1803
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:51,830
I am so tired
.

1804
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:13,310
I'm sorry about Anne Johnson.

1805
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,980
That was bad
...

1806
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,730
senseIess.

1807
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,990
It wasn't me.

1808
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,530
It was fear on my part.

1809
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,580
You'd have made a good
archaeoIogist, Mr. Poirot.

1810
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:35,500
You have the gift
of re-creating the past.

1811
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:41,090
I Ioved Louise
,

1812
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,930
and I kiIIed her
.

1813
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,220
But you shan't have her, Carey!

1814
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,680
You betrayed me
.

1815
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:54,230
You betrayed both of us
.

1816
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,780
Oh if you'd known Louise
,...

1817
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,360
you'd have understood
.

1818
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,160
No.

1819
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:15,870
I think you understand anyway
.

1820
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,390
[Engine starts]

1821
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,260
What are you doing here
,
Hastings?

1822
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:06,130
I'm enjoying my Iast
few moments in Baghdad
.

1823
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:08,430
And in 43 minutes
,

1824
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:11,890
the Iast train for one week,
it Ieaves for IstanbuI.

1825
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:13,520
WeII, it's 10 minutes
to the station

1826
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,430
and the cab's round the corner
with my Iuggage in it.

1827
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,600
Have a tisane.

1828
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:22,400
[Speaks Arabic]

1829
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,990
HASTINGS: I didn't know you
spoke Arabic, Poirot.

1830
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:34,950
Just a few words
that I have picked up Hastings
,.

1831
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,290
One shouId never squander

1832
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:39,630
the opportunity
that traveI affords
.

1833
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,170
- A tisane.
- Yes, sir.

1834
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,840
Monsieur Poirot!

1835
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:49,380
I have found you!

1836
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:50,430
What is it, Monsieur?

1837
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:51,640
The teIephone, monsieur --

1838
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,140
from the Countess Rossakoff.

1839
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,600
<i>Merci.</i>

1840
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:00,100
No, no, no, Monsieur!

1841
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:02,190
She has gone!

1842
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:03,230
Gone?

1843
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,110
Yes, Monsieur.

1844
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:06,190
The Iine --

1845
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,650
the reception
was very very bad
,,

1846
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,660
and she was speaking
from Budapest
.

1847
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,740
?
Budapest

1848
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:14,870
- She Ieft a message.
- Go on.

1849
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:18,660
She said she had been
caIIed to Shanghai,

1850
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,750
and wouId you kindIy settIe

1851
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:22,920
her biII for her?

1852
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,250
Her biII?

1853
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,760
Yes, Monsieur.

1854
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,930
She said she wouId
settIe up

1855
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,230
the next time she saw you.

1856
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:49,240
Monsieur.

1857
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,210
Do not speak, Hastings!
