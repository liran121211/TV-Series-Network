he, Marina?

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Disgraceful.

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,540
Is that the last of them, then, sir?
I would have been quite happy to...

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,480
No. I wanted to write them myself.

8
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Seems only right.

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,560

friends.

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,620
Well, then...

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,500

Really? Me?

Oh.

Well, I don't really...

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Hard to know what to say, isn't it?
Gosh.

My friends.

19
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,420
I know.

20
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,640
To my master.

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
The best of masters.

22
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,620
To our dear friend.

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,420
To Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

24
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,640

It's all a bit Bulldog Drummond,
don't you think, Mr Tysoe?

31
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,620
At first, yeah, I did.

32
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,620
But I've had more letters since.
I think there's something in it.

came off the rails, the Plymouth

Course.

35

My correspondent claims
that was the work of the Big Four.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,480
And the riots in India.
Local agitators.

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Not according to these.
A crank, young man.

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,460
The idea there's some sort of
organising power controlling the
world,

39
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,460
it's a very common fantasy amongst
paranoiacs.

40
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,540
Mr Ingles.
I've been doing some research.

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,620
Mr Tysoe, we stand on the edge of an
abyss.

42
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,500
Germany, Italy. A storm is gathering.

43
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,500
We've enough to worry about
without some far-fetched nonsense
like this.

44
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,600
Far-fetched? Is it?

If you could go over
to the left of the chessboard,
please.

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,480
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

Ah! Mille tonnerres.
Mon cher Inspector Japp.

Hello, Poirot.
Ah, mon ami. Mon ami.

50
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,460
It has been too long. Far too long.
My dear Inspector Japp.

Assistant Commissioner now if you
don't mind.

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,620
Pardon. Pardon.

I've been following your progress
with the interest most keen.

You are here in the capacity
professional?

56
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm not quite a spent force yet,
Poirot.

57
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,460
They still wheel me out for
the occasional important assignment.

58
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Lot of foreign bigwigs here tonight.

59
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,540
Mr Ryland over there's requested
a discreet police presence for this
chess match.

60
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,560
I must say, it's nice to get out from
behind
a desk, stretch the old pins again.

61
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,420
Though there won't be many more
assignments like this, I fancy.

62
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,540
Well, you know, time,
it catches up with us all.

63
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,580
Perhaps also for Poirot
the shadows are lengthening

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,500
and the moment it is come
to think of the life that is quiet.

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,620
You retire, Poirot? Never.

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,520

Ah, that is the great Madame
Olivier.

69
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,580
Ah, right, one of Ryland's Peace
Party johnnies.

70
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,560
One of your lot, isn't she?
Comment?

71
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,460
Belgian?
Non.

72
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,600
She's French, not Belgian.

73
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,600
But in her field she is a genius.

74
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,400
Her research into the nervous
system, it is truly groundbreaking.

75
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,460
Hm. You might say she has
the greatest brain in the Western
world.

76
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,640
The greatest scientific brain,
indeed.

77
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,520
Of course.

calls.

leaving China, but he is with us in
spirit.

We're all aware of the international
situation,

93
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,540
at the grave pass at which
the civilised world finds itself,

94
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,540
which is why we in the Peace Party
see it as our mission, our duty,

95
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,580
to avoid the lamps going out once
again.

97
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,400
One day, years ago, I woke up and I
realised

98
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,460
that I hadn't a clue
what to do with all my money.

Tell us how you got your money, Mr
Ryland.

This is an invitation-only event,
sir.

102
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,420
You won't answer my telephone calls,
Mr Ryland.

103
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,500
How else am I supposed to reach you?

104
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,460
This is intolerable.

105
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,560

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,580
And why wouldn't they?

110
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,600
To witness this demonstration of
unity between East and West

111
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,480
via this ancient and beautiful game.

112
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,420
Now, I would like to thank our
friend, the Russian ambassador,

113
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,480
for coaxing our guest out of
retirement.

114
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,480
May I introduce to you
the illustrious Dr Ivan Savaranoff.

115
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,460
Oh!
Who?

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,580
Dr Savaranoff. He is the greatest
of the Russian grand masters.

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,460
You are not a player of chess?

118
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,620
No. Dominoes is more in my line,
Poirot.

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,460
Welcome, sir.

120
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
He's getting on a bit.

121
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,640
It is many years since he's been
seen in public, mon ami.

122
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,560
I warn you, sir, I may be an
amateur, but I won't be beat without
a fight.

123
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,440
That's always been my motto.

124
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,520
Well, then, without further ado,
let battle commence.

130
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,540
Can I help, monsieur? I have some
expertise.

131
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm afraid it's too late.

132
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
He's gone.

133
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,800
They had trouble getting this out of
his hand. Rigor mortis, I expect.

134
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,840
I expect so.

If you please to show Poirot
the belongings of the old man.

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,820
I don't know what you're getting
yourself so broody about, Poirot.

137
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,780
You only had to look at him
to know he wasn't long for this
world.

138
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Natural causes, dicky ticker. It says
so here.

139
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,860
Quelle coincidence.
What's that?

140
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,040
The researches of Madame Olivier
concern the effects

141
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,880
of atropine and morphine and so on
on the heart and the nervous system.

142
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,780
Ah, so that's what she meant
by "expertise".

143
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,860
Oui.

144
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,980
But, alas, it was too late for her
to save him.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,980
So, after all these years of being a
recluse,

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,900
he agrees to travel halfway round the
world for a publicity stunt.

147
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I have no doubt that Dr Savaranoff
was paid most handsomely.

148
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Ah, but why was Ryland
prepared to pay so much?

149
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,860
You again.
Yes, we were never formally
introduced.

Come on, son.
Mon ami.

152
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,980
What is your interest here, Monsieur
Tysoe?

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Something fishy about the old man's
death.

154
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Dr Savaranoff died of natural causes.
Really?

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,900
Don't tell me the great Hercule
Poirot would bother with something
like this

156
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,880
unless foul play was suspected.

157
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,820
If and when we have something to
announce to the press, you'll be the
first to know.

158
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,860
Don't be so hasty.

159
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,900
Play your cards right, maybe I can
supply you
with the truth about Abe Ryland,

160
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,840
fill you in on the skeletons
he's got hiding in his closet

161
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,020
and what he knows about the Big
Four.

162
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,860
What is this Big Four?

163
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
Ring me, Mr Poirot.

164
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
You won't regret it. Ring me.

aren't they?

Did you ever play Juliet, Flossie?

172
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,900
Yes. Quite recently, actually.

173
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,860
Oh...right.

174
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,900
You're not reading that rubbish
again, are you?

175
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,820
It's not rubbish.

176
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,920
It gives me the horrors,
all these rumours about another war.

177
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,020
Oh, I almost forgot.
Reg asked me to give this to you.

178
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,980
Somebody must have left it at stage
door.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,880
A letter? For me?
Must be fan mail.

180
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, open it, then.

181
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,980
Ooh, even better, a valentine.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,940
But it's April.
Oh, yes, so it is.

183
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,980
"Dear Flossie,
never forgotten, until we meet
again.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,900
4 kisses."

185
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,940
Well? Who is it from?

186
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,880
It doesn't say.

187
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,880
Monsieur Tysoe.

188
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,840
Knew you'd come. Can't resist a
scoop, eh?

189
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,000
You'd have made a good journalist,
Mr Poirot.

190
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,820
I think Poirot has the wrong kind
of morality for the work.

191
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,000
You're too modest, I'm sure.

192
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,860
S'il vous plait.

193
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,900
Monsieur Tysoe, you spoke of
skeletons in the armoire of Monsieur
Ryland.

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,860
Arm what?

195
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, I see, in the cupboard.

196
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,820
Well, let me tell you, Abe Ryland
is not the man everyone thinks he
is.

197
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,860
Real name's Abram Ryakhin, born in
Kursk.

198
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,800
Appeared in America about 25 years
ago, the outbreak of the Great War.

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,860
Changed his name,
his voice, his whole identity.

200
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
So my question is: why?

201
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,980
What is it that you know?

202
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,940
I know how he made his money. Arms
dealing.

203
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Huh?
He made millions.

204
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Selling weapons to the Allies and
the Kaiser.

205
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,820
You have proof of this?
Naturally.

206
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,040
And maybe he was planning
on doing the same thing again.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,880
What is this Big Four that you
mentioned?

208
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,840
Certain...information been coming my
way.

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Letters.

210
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,040
And what do they say, these letters?

211
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,860
Well, not so fast, now, not so fast.
I've shared my information on
Ryland.

212
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,900
It's only fair you show a little
reciprocity, wouldn't you say?

213
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
What is it you want?
Full access to your investigation.

214
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,940
I work alongside you and your copper
pal.

215
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,820
Monsieur Tysoe, you seem to be a man
who is ambitious, who is creative

216
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,980
and perhaps even
with some level of intelligence.

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,940
That supposed to be a compliment?

218
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,900
But you are not a man of discretion,
monsieur.

219
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,040
Were we to share information, what
would stop
it from appearing in your newspaper?

220
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,040
It seems I'll have to play a lone
hand in this investigation.

221
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,980
That would be foolish, monsieur.

222
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,900
You would be wise
to reveal what you know,

223
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,940
for your own safety if for nothing
else.

224
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,840
I don't respond to threats, Mr
Poirot.

225
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,800
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

226
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,840
You've let Li Chang Yen know
what happened last night?

227
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
I've telegraphed.

228
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,940
Then there is nothing more
we can do for now.

229
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,940
What is troubling you?
We have enemies out there, Regine.

230
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,000
Those who seek to destroy
both us and our work.

231
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,000
And I've learned that in this life
you can only trust number one.

232
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,000
JAPP: They had trouble getting this
out of his hand. Rigor mortis, I
expect.

233
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,980
Ruy Lopez...

234
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,940
Assistant Commissioner Japp, s'il
vous plait.

235
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,940
Will this take long, gentlemen?
I'm a very busy man.

236
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Monsieur Ryland...

237
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you remember the exact succession
of moves made by Dr Savaranoff?

238
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,940
Of course. He used the Ruy Lopez
opening. It's the soundest in the
game.

239
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,940
And Savaranoff was reputed to favour
this?

240
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah. So what?

241
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,900
What was the third move
of the white piece in this opening?

242
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,820
Bishop to queen's knight five.
Bon.

243
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,900
The exact move that sealed the fate
of Dr Savaranoff.

244
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,980
If you please to be patient.

245
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,800
This, it is the white bishop
from the chess set,

246
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,000
the exact piece that Dr Savaranoff
was clutching in his hand when he
died.

247
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,980
They look identical, no?
Two white bishops from the same
chess set?

248
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,940
Ah. There is a rather thin metal
which passes up through this
chessman.

249
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
What?

250
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,040
Et maintenant...

251
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Observe.

252
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,960
The table, it is electrified,

253
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,860
and so when Dr Savaranoff places the
white bishop upon this particular
silver square,

254
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,860
the electric current passes
right through his body killing him
instantly.

255
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,940
He was electrocuted.
Oui, bien sur. Regarde.

256
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,920
The table is clamped to the floor,
so the current passes through it.

257
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,840
It is, en effet,
the killing machine most elaborate.

258
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,860
From where was it obtained, may I
ask? You'd have to ask one of my
staff.

259
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,820
I don't concern myself with such
matters.

260
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,820
You do not concern yourself
with the death of a man?

261
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,980
He was an old man.
Old men tend to die, in my
experience.

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,820
From natural causes, yes,
not usually via electrified chess
tables.

263
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,900
Now, you just listen to me.

264
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,880
If you truly believe
Savaranoff was murdered

265
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,820
and in this colourful way Monsieur
Poirot suggests, that's your
prerogative.

266
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,920
But if you are even suggesting
that I had anything to do with it,

267
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,880
then you're gonna have to
get yourself some proof.

268
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,900
Hello? Could you put me through
to Mr Tysoe, please?

269
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,880
He isn't?

270
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,880
No, no message. Thank you.

Please to show her in, George.

274
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,980
This way, madam.

275
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
I shall come straight to the point,
monsieur.

276
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,820
You have seen this?

277
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,820
Ah.

278
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,980
"Does the great detective,
Monsieur Hercule Poirot,

279
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,980
have suspicions regarding
the death of Ivan Savaranoff?

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,820
His inquiries currently revolve
around Abe Ryland and his mysterious
Peace Party."

281
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,880
Calm yourself, madame.
It is merely the tittle-tattle.

282
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,780
We have no evidence
that Monsieur Ryland is involved.

283
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,860
There are those who seek to
discredit all of us in the Peace
Party, monsieur.

284
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,020
I implore you,
do nothing to aid these people.

Hercule Poirot speaks.

288
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
Ryland was meant to meet
some German dignitary last night.

289
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,980
He never turned up.
Comment?

290
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,940
We haven't a clue where he's got to.

291
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
He's gone, Poirot. He's disappeared.

294
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,520
Good afternoon, sir.
You must be Meadows.

295
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,500
This is the local man on the case,
Poirot.

296
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,500
It's an honour, sir, and an honour
to meet you too, Mr Poirot,

297
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,480
although I don't know that
there's very much to interest you
here.

298
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,580
Fairly grubby little murder if you
ask me,

299
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,500
and not too much doubt
about who's to blame, neither.

300
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,520
The victim was Jonathan Whalley,
something of a recluse and a...

301
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,380
Sinophile.

302
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440
Yeah, whatever that is.

303
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,420
It means that he was a lover
of all things Chinese, mon ami.

304
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,420
Ah, and this is the reason
for our interest in this case,
Inspector Meadows.

305
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,460
The late Monsieur Jonathan Whalley
was the author of this biography.

306
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,420
Have you got the details
of the household, Inspector?

307
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,420
Well, there are two servants.

308
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,560
Robert Grant who's the kind of
manservant. He lives in.

309
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,580
And Betsy Andrews, housekeeper and
cook.

310
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,420
You've worked for Mr Whalley
for some time?

311
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,500
Oh, years.

312
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,500
He was a queer old cove.

313
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,580
Kept himself to himself.

314
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,560
Had his little obsessions
like they all do at that age.

315
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,580
Obsessions?
Crackers about all things Chinese.

316
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,500
Did he ever marry?
No. Can you imagine it?

317
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,420
What woman would have him?

318
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,580
Woe betide you if you tried to move
one of his precious books

319
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,520
or tidy up his bloomin' letters.

320
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,500
Were there any other friends or
family?

321
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,500
Friends? No.

322
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,560
He had a sister. But she died.

323
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,540
There was a...a young nephew

324
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,540
who came here to stay with him
when he was orphaned.

325
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,580
That was before my time, though.
By all accounts, they didn't get on.

326
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,560
Madame Andrews, can you tell to us
exactly what occurred this morning,
precisement?

327
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,540
Grant went out to get the milk,
as he does every day.

328
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,620
I popped out to have a natter
with Mrs Stubbs at Laburnum's.

329
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,600
She's buried two children, poor
soul,

330
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,560
and her husband's none too clever
at the moment.

331
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,620
- And which of you returned first?
Oh, that would be Grant.

332
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,580
He came in by the back door,

333
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,640
put the milk in the larder...

334
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,500
..and then went into his room to
read the paper and have a smoke.

335
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,480
So it was you who discovered the
body, madame?

336
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Just...just there he was.

337
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:31,500
Poor soul, he'd been knocked silly
and had his throat slit.

338
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,600
Oh, nasty, it was.

339
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,440
Very nasty.

340
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,580
Bon.

341
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,420
So the story about Grant going and
fetching milk is true at least, then.

342
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Oui.

343
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,460
Ah.

344
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,520
What is it, Poirot?
Une jambe de mouton.

345
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Mutton, sir?
Oui.

346
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,520
Mm. Still frozen. There's ice on it.

347
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,500
You're not suggesting
he used a frozen leg of mutton

348
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,500
to cosh the old gentleman, are you,
sir?

349
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,580
And then cut his throat with the
wishbone?

350
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,500
What is the day, mon ami?

351
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,380
The day?
Oui.

352
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,460
Well, Monday, of course.

353
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
Oui, oui.

354
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,500
To commit a murder on a Monday,
it is a mistake most grave.

355
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,540
Monsieur Robert Grant is in custody?
We've taken him in for questioning.

356
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,400
Grant's story was that
he went straight to his bedroom

357
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,500
and that it was Betsy Andrews
who discovered the body.

358
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,540
But then there's the matter of the
footprints.

359
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,540
Whalley kept his most valuable
Chinese curios locked in this
cabinet here.

360
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,600
And is it locked now?
Key's in the lock, sir.

361
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,420
Mr Whalley kept it on his person
on his watch chain at all times.

362
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
But someone has removed it.

363
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,380
Mr Whalley was fond of boasting
that his most prized possession

364
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,460
was a set of little ivory figures
that he kept in here,

365
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,560
18th century apparently, and they're
gone.

366
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,640
And this bloody footprint here...
Oh, begging your pardon, sir.

367
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,420
It's all right, Meadows.
We know what you mean.

368
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,540
Well, it matches exactly with
Grant's boot.

369
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,580
And a footprint which if Monsieur
Grant were telling the truth he
could not have made.

370
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Quite so, sir.

371
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,380
So you now have the opportunity
and the motive.

372
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,480
All that you require now is that
oh, so elusive element, the proof.

373
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,580
The missing figures?

374
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,620
I have no doubt you will find them
hidden in the room of Monsieur
Grant,

375
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,500
probably underneath his bed.

376
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,420
Fancy seeing you here, Mr Poirot.

377
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,540
You seem to be everywhere at once.

378
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,500
May Poirot inquire what it is that
you do here?

379
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,500
The news of this crime,
it has not yet been released.

380
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,480
I'm here for the same reason you
are. Indeed?

381
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,540
Whalley knew something.
Something dangerous, that much is
obvious.

382
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,420
So somebody got him out of the way.

383
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,520
And it was your source
who once again gave to you this
tip-off?

384
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,580
I'm in possession
of certain information, yeah.

385
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,520
Well, well,
if it isn't the proverbial bad penny.

386
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,380
Assistant Commissioner.

387
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,420
You can account for your movements
at the time of Mr Whalley's death?

388
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,460
That's uncalled for.
Oh, we've got him now, sir.

389
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Honest to God, I never did it.
It's a frame-up, that's what it is.

390
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,400
I came back and went straight to my
room.

391
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,400
I never knew anything till Betsy
screamed, so help me God I didn't.

392
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,620
If you do not tell the truth,
then that is the end of it.

393
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
But, guv'nor...
No, monsieur.

394
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,420
You did go into the drawing room.
You did know that your master was
dead.

395
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,380
You were preparing to make a bolt
for it

396
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,600
when Madame Andrews
made the discovery so terrible.

397
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,460
Come, now. Is that not so?

398
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,420
I say solemnly
to tell to me the truth now.

399
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,400
It is your only chance.

400
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,420
Yeah.

401
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,460
It's just as you say.
Bon.

402
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,540
Mr Whalley?

403
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,580
I came in
and went straight over to the master,

404
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,420
and there he was dead on the floor,
blood all around.

405
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,420
Then I got the wind up proper.

406
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,400
They'd ferret out my record
and say it was me who'd done him in.

407
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,540
And the figures of ivory?

408
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,460
They was gonna blame the murder
on me anyway.

409
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,400
The master had said
how they was worth a lot of loot.

410
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,600
I might as well go the whole hog.

411
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
And then before I could make a run
for it,

412
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,600
Betsy was back and screaming the
place down.

413
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,420
You expect us
to believe all that, Grant?

414
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,580
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
telling such bare-faced lies

415
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,460
to an important man like Mr Poirot
here.

416
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,420
Monsieur Grant,
when were you released from prison?

417
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,480
Two months ago.

418
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,420
And how did you obtain your position
in the household?

419
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,620
Through one of them
prisoners' help societies.

420
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,420
Bloke met me when I come out.
He said this before, Poirot.

421
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,540
There's no record of any such
society placing him with Jonathan
Whalley.

422
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,620
I swear it, sir. It was a pastor, a
priest.

423
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,420
Do you recall what he looked like,
this pastor?

424
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,500
No. I'm sorry, sir.

425
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,440
He just sort of looked middling
height, ordinary, you know?

426
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm afraid I must go ahead
and charge this man, sir.

427
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,560
No. If you do, Inspector Meadows,
you will charge the wrong man.

428
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,620
Monsieur Grant is not the killer.

429
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,560
Thank you, sir. I knew you'd believe
me.

430
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,420
Merci.

431
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,460
Sir, I've been thinking this over
and it doesn't add up.

432
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,540
If it's not Grant, well, no one else
approached the cottage all morning.

433
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,520
The neighbours' curtains
twitch like billyo here in Hoppaton.

434
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,620
If there'd been a stranger
come into the house, well...

435
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,500
You're not suggesting Betsy Andrews?

436
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,500
Poirot will describe for you
the killer of Jonathan Whalley.

437
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,560
The murderer was a man
who was clever, very clever.

438
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,620
First he posed as a prison visitor.

439
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,580
Then he obtained a post for Monsieur
Grant,

440
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,540
with the deliberate intention
of making him the scaping goat.

441
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Then he gave to him a pair of boots,
one of two pairs that were
duplicate.

442
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,500
The other he kept for himself.

443
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,400
Then he drove up outside the house
in a van.

444
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Leaving it in full view, he entered
the house, committed the murder

445
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,520
wearing the boots identical.

446
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,620
Then he drove away.

447
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,520
This man, he wore a hat of straw
and his clothing was slightly
bloodstained.

448
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,460
But, Poirot, the whole village
would have seen him.

449
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,620
Vrai dire. Everybody saw him,
and nobody saw him.

450
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,400
He drove up in the van of a butcher.

451
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,580
This leg of mutton would not have
remained frozen if it was delivered
on Saturday.

452
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,620
Non. Someone delivered
this leg of mutton today,

453
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,500
moreover someone on whom
a trace of blood here and there

454
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,420
would attract no attention.

455
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,380
Blimey. I'll get round
and arrest the butcher straightaway.

456
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,480
No, do not trouble yourself,
Inspector.

457
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,540
The real butcher would have made
no such delivery today.

458
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,420
No, this is a business most dark,
mes amis,

459
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,540
and I fear we are only at the
beginning of a long, long game

460
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,540
MAN: Mr Tysoe!

461
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
(MAN GROANS)

462
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,260
You cannot say
you have not been warned.

463
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,340
I know.

464
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,300
That's why I'm here now and putting
everything I've got in front of you.

465
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,340
It started with anonymous tip-offs.
Train crashes, riots.

466
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,400
I went to Ingles at the Foreign
Office. Dismissed it out of hand.

467
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Then the messages
started to become more cryptic.

468
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Merci.

469
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,380
"The game will begin shortly, a
battle of wits,
and then a king shall fall.

470
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,300
Beware, beware, the Big Four."

471
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,220
That arrived along with a dossier on
Ryland.

472
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,280
"A king shall fall."

473
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,240
Yeah, obviously referring to the
chess game. This was next.

474
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
"Death will come to Hoppaton
village.

475
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,360
The dragon shall feast."

476
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,200
Jonathan Whalley of Hoppaton,
he is found dead.

477
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,300
Someone on the inside was trying to
tip me off.

478
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,280
Someone inside the Big Four turned
traitor.

479
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,240
Now they've found him out and he's
lying in a morgue with a knife in
his back.

480
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,180
Have you identified the deceased
man? No, nothing yet.

481
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,380
There's something else.
Indeed?

482
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,320
This was inside his coat pocket,
addressed to me like all the others.

483
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,420
That's where you should have left
it. That's evidence.

484
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,280
Yeah, well.

485
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,340
Playing cards?

486
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,260
Of a kind, oui.

487
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,200
But the first one is of the origin
Chinese.

488
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,420
And on it there has been scored the
numero un.

489
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Li Chang Yen. Has to be.

490
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,380
Brains behind the so-called Peace
Party.

491
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,380
Deux.

492
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,280
That's a Chance card from a Monopoly
set.

493
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,380
You don't have to be a genius
to work that one out.

494
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,280
Ryland.

495
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,400
Le numero trois.

496
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,220
Why does it say D and not Q?

497
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,400
Because this is from a French pack
of playing cards, mon ami. La dame.

498
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,260
Une dame francaise.

499
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,240
Et finalement,
from the major arcana of the tarot...

500
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,220
Quatre. C'est la mort.

501
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,220
Death.

502
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,300
Mrs Japp got dealt one like
that on Southend Pier.

503
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,360
Gypsy Meg. Three months later the
cat died.

504
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,260
One, two, three, four.

505
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,320
Whoever the dead man was, he was
trying to give me a clue to their
identities.

506
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,380
What is it, Poirot?

507
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,340
Do you not observe, mon ami?
The edge of this card, it is burnt.

508
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,300
"A toast to our future.

509
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,260
All my love.

510
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,320
4 kisses."

511
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,320
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Mm?

512
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,220
You're going to miss your cue
if you're not careful, darling.

513
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,420
Blast.

514
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,200
(APPLAUSE)

515
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,260
Oh. Ah Ling. We can't wait any
longer.

516
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Please, ring the gong for dinner.

517
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,380
STEPHEN: You're asking too much
of the new regime.

518
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,280
OLIVIER: What are you saying?

519
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,320
Remember our dream, everything
we talked about, all we can achieve.

520
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,440
I don't think I can go through with
it.

521
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,340
Stephen...
I don't have your certainty.

522
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm not like you. It's wrong, what
we're doing, it's all wrong.

523
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,240
(GONG RINGS)

524
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,420
Still no news of Mr Ryland,
Madame Olivier?

525
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,260
Nothing at all.

526
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,340
And it is also very damaging to the
party.

527
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,420
He should be protesting his
innocence.

528
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,300
The newspapers are full of talk
about the Big Four.

529
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,200
No, it is nonsense.
Quite.

530
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,320
It's true that there is bad
blood between America and Russia,
though, isn't it,

531
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,380
after Savaranoff's death?

532
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,300
I've been speaking
with the Soviet ambassador,

533
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,260
trying to calm things down, but...

534
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,340
My husband the conciliator.
What would the world do without you,
my dear?

535
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,260
Let's hope we'll never find out.

536
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,340
I'll drink to that.

537
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,360
(FRONT DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, they're here.

538
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,420
I hoped they'd join us eventually.

539
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,260
It's really not that late, my dear.

540
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,340
So sorry. So very, very sorry.
Can you ever forgive me, Auntie Di?

541
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,380
I was out with the chaps
and time just ran away from me.

542
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,300
You're on your own, are you, Gerald?

543
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,240
I thought you were bringing
Miss Struthers with you tonight.

544
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,380
Oh, good Lord, so I was.

545
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,380
Huh. Well, Amelia will have sorted
herself out.

546
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,380
She's probably had a better offer,
what?

547
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Or did I leave her at that blessed
party? Oh, well.

548
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,280
You're here now, Gerald, that's all
that matters. Why don't you sit
down?

549
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,260
So sorry. You must be la grande
dame, Madame O.

550
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,300
Uncle Stephen
speaks terribly highly of you.

551
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,380
You're staying for a few days,
that's right.

552
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm the black sheep of the family.

553
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,360
A pleasure to meet you, Gerald.

554
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
Oh, uh, yes, remind me again.

555
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,260
Gerald.

556
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
The name's Quentin.

557
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,180
Oh, of course, of course. Uncle
Stephen's sore bones. Terribly
sorry.

558
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Have you eaten, Gerald?
Ah Ling's finest curry? Rather.

559
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,340
Fill up the bowl, my friend.
Now, where's the wine?

560
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Anyone for a top-up?

561
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,220
TYSOE: That's him, poor bugger.

562
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,300
Stabbed in the lower back with some
force.

563
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,220
Kitchen knife.
But observe, mes amis.

564
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,260
Despite all the efforts of the staff
in this mortuary to wash him down,

565
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,260
the dirt, it is deep, it is
ingrained.

566
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,300
He'd been on the run from the Big
Four.

567
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,180
You're hardly going to stop
and run a tub, are you?

568
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,300
And yet you say his clothes, his
evening dress, they are of some
quality, yes?

569
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,340
Very nice, yes. Bit old-fashioned,
mind.

570
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,440
Poirot, he would like to see them.
Sir.

571
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,240
It's been so kind of Uncle Stephen
to take me on.

572
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,220
Don't you think, madame?
Indeed.

573
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,420
Prodigal returns and all that.

574
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,220
It was the least I could do
for my brother's boy.

575
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,400
Ssh, ssh. It's all under the bridge
now.

576
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,320
Family feud forgiven and forgotten.

577
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm glad to have been able to make
amends in some small way.

578
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,340
It's curious, most curious.

579
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,400
What is?

580
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:27,200
The cloth, it is of the quality most
fine, and yet the fashion, it is of
since 30 years.

581
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,380
No labels.

582
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,220
Ah.
TYSOE: What is it?

583
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,400
There's a fragment, that is all.

584
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,240
TYSOE: A name?
Of a kind, oui, but...

585
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,300
E-R-M-A-N.

586
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,340
Herman? German?

587
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,240
You think he stole the clothes,
some kind of disguise?

588
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,220
Now, mes amis, we must discover
the identity of this man

589
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,200
and find out his connection with the
Big Four.

590
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
MRS PAYNTER: Stephen!

591
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
Stephen!

592
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Stephen! Unlock the door!

593
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,280
Ah Ling, hurry!

594
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,320
Stephen, answer me!

595
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
(SCREAMS)

596
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,180
Oh! What a terrible way for a man to
die.

597
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,420
Ruddy odd if you ask me.

598
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,220
Why the fire? I mean, it makes the
face completely unrecognisable.

599
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,340
Oui.
Do you think that was the
intention?

600
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,220
Poirot, he has thought of this,
but, no, there seems little doubt

601
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,200
that the dead person
is Monsieur Stephen Paynter.

602
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,420
So, the killer comes into the room,

603
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,340
pulls him off the bed
and drags him over to the fire.

604
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,260
Not the easiest way to kill a man.
Constable.

605
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,300
There would have been
a struggle tremendous.

606
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,420
And screams, screams which
nobody in the house admits to
hearing.

607
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,340
Who discovered the body?

608
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,380
Chinese manservant. Chinese, Poirot.

609
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,300
And Diana Paynter, the wife of 30
years.

610
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,260
Smelt the smoke apparently
from her own bedroom.

611
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,380
Alors Madame Paynter, she does not
share the bed chamber with her
husband?

612
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,360
Didn't you hear me, Poirot? 30
years.

613
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,220
To be honest, I think Mrs Japp would
jump at this type of sleeping
arrangement,

614
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,380
if we had the room.

615
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,340
See you, Inspector, the finger?
A clue most bizarre, no?

616
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:02,380
Ah, now, apparently Mr Paynter kept
a notepad, a pen and a bottle of ink
by his bedside,

617
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,320
and this is what he wrote last
night.

618
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,180
Dr Quentin, you were the
personal physician of the late
Monsieur Paynter?

619
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,240
That's correct.

620
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,340
Stephen had a heart condition,
easily managed with the right
medication.

621
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,300
But it was thought prudent
that there should be someone on
hand.

622
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,260
What has his state of mind been
lately?

623
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,340
He'd been anxious.

624
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,300
All this stuff in the papers
is enough to alarm anyone.

625
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,260
And now Ryland's vanished.
It's a great blow to the party.

626
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,400
When did you last see him alive,
Doctor?

627
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,260
Around 11:30 last night.
He asked to see me before he retired
to bed.

628
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,200
How did you find him?

629
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,220
He was very agitated.

630
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,440
I suggested a tonic,
but he said he just wanted to get to
bed.

631
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,280
One final question, if I may, Doctor.

632
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,340
Merci.

633
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,280
Do you recognise this man?

634
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,200
He does look vaguely familiar.
For what reason?

635
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,300
He's something to do
with the Peace Party, I think.

636
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,380
I met so many people
through Stephen and his work

637
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
that I really couldn't say for sure.

638
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,300
No, I don't know him.
Try to think carefully, madame.

639
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,300
Perhaps you met him through your late
husband and his work?

640
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,260
Stephen rarely thought to include me
in his work, monsieur.

641
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,380
I'm sorry I can't be any more help
to you.

642
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,180
We do not wish to distress you,
madame.

643
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,400
I loved my husband, monsieur.

644
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:36,340
But I realised some time ago
that my affection was no longer
reciprocated.

645
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,220
Last night I learned for certain
what I had suspected for some time,

646
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,340
that he...

647
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,420
..that he...

648
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,220
That he and Madame Olivier
were conducting the love affair?

649
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,260
How did you...?

650
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,360
This Poirot had observed
at the chess tournament.

651
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,180
I am so sorry, madame.

652
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,240
Did you hear any kind
of disturbance in the night, Mr
Paynter?

653
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,260
No. Believe me, after the amount of
booze I put away,

654
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,340
it's a miracle I woke at all this
morning.

655
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Dead to the world, I was.

656
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,300
Oh, dear. Sorry.

657
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,300
Are you sure I can't get you
anything?

658
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,300
Bit early for me, sir.
Thank you all the same.

659
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,440
It would be for me too usually,
but, you know, poor old Uncle
Stephen.

660
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,220
You hear about these kind of freak
accidents happening all the time.

661
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,320
Still, a shock when it happens
to one of your nearest and dearest.

662
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,360
You think, then,
that this was an accident?

663
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,380
Well, what else could it have been?

664
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,340
How did you and your uncle get on
together?

665
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Well, I don't feel I had the chance
to get to know him properly.

666
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,280
I've only been here a few months.
Is that so?

667
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,380
Yes. Father and Uncle Stephen
fell out, you see.

668
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,180
There'd been an incident
when I was only a nipper.

669
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,300
And do you know the nature of this
incident?

670
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,260
Well, this. A firework exploded in
my face.

671
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,260
Father always blamed Uncle Stephen.

672
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,200
I don't even remember it, of course,
but they never spoke again.

673
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,300
So he gets a tidy sum
as a result of Paynter's death.

674
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,340
And the manner of his death,
so violent and dramatic.

675
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,220
The fire that consumes
the face of Monsieur Paynter,

676
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,380
an echo grotesque
of the burning of his own face.

677
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,420
And as he lies dying, Monsieur
Paynter, he dips his finger into the
ink

678
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,380
and scrawls the letter G onto a
notepad, a final desperate attempt

679
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,420
to indicate the identity of his
killer.

680
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,220
Gerald did it for revenge
and for the cash?

681
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,300
Non, non, mon ami.

682
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,200
A fourth murder with a connection
to the Peace Party and the Big Four?

683
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,340
Non. This is an attempt most crude
to frame young Monsieur Gerald.

684
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,340
Mm.

685
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,420
Well, I suppose
we'd better have the big one in.

686
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,200
I shall do all I can to assist you.

687
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,380
This is a terrible loss for the
world, and for me personally.

688
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,220
Perhaps you can assist us, madame,
with the identity of this man?

689
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,380
He's not known to me, monsieur.

690
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Then perhaps you should take
a closer look, madame.

691
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,380
My eyesight is excellent.

692
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
I can assure you,
I do not know who this man is.

693
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,300
Madame, we understand
that before dinner last night

694
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,220
you and Monsieur Paynter
conversed in private?

695
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,420
Yes, we talked
of the future of the Peace Party.

696
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,420
That's a lie.
Mrs Paynter, please.

697
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,180
I may not have
your world-class brain, madame,

698
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,300
but I have sense enough to know

699
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,340
when my husband is conducting
a love affair behind my back.

700
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Diana.

701
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,340
He wanted to finish it with you,
and your pride couldn't bear it.

702
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,220
I heard him. "It's all wrong.
I can't go on with this." That's
what he said.

703
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,260
I wouldn't be surprised if you
killed him rather than let him come
back to me.

704
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,440
It is not true.
Mrs Paynter.

705
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,240
Monsieur, surely you cannot
believe...

706
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,260
We believe, madame, that we are
dealing with an organisation so
ruthless

707
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,340
that it will not hesitate to execute
any who stand in its way.

708
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,360
If you know anything at all about the
Big Four, I implore you to tell it to
us.

709
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,340
You accuse me, monsieur?

710
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,380
There is evidence to suggest,
Madame Olivier,

711
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,420
that one of the members of the Big
Four is a woman, a French woman.

712
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,240
Gentlemen, I find your accusations
contemptible and absurd.

713
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,300
You will try and prevent me if I
leave?

714
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,440
No, I can't do that, madame.
You're not under arrest.

715
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,320
You have not heard the last of this,
not by any means.

716
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Mille tonnerres!

717
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,440
We should not have antagonised her.
It is not yet the time.

718
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,300
"I can't go through with this. It's
all wrong."

719
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,340
Maybe he wasn't referring to their
affair, Poirot.

720
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:14,260
So he was killed because he wanted no
more to do with this organisation so
sinister?

721
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,420
Where the hell is this going,
Poirot? We've got nothing to go on,
nothing.

722
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,180
There must be a link, mon ami,

723
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,320
a connection however abstruse
between these cases,

724
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,260
something that we have missed.

725
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,220
The link's obvious, Poirot.
It's the ruddy Peace Party.

726
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,260
If what Tysoe's mysterious source
told him is true,

727
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,420
then they're exactly the opposite
of what they claim to be:

728
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,340
fifth columnists working to start a
war, not prevent one.

729
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,360
Poirot must think.

730
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Think.

731
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,300
Assistant Commissioner Japp, sir.

732
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,260
Poirot, she's gone.
Gone? Who has gone, mon ami?

733
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,380
Madame Olivier.
She's done a bunk too, just like Abe
Ryland.

734
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,380
No one's seen hide nor hair of her
since she left Paynter's place.

735
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,380
And there's something else.

736
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,440
We've had the tests back from
Paynter's body.

737
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,180
He was drugged. That's why he didn't
cry out when his head was put in the
fire.

738
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,220
The drug was very specific.
Gelsemine.

739
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,380
Gelsemine?

740
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,340
Non.
What is it?

741
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,380
You recall the scientific researches
of Madame Olivier?

742
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,260
They are concerned principally
with the nervous system.

743
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,300
In small quantities
gelsemine is used to treat the heart.

744
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,240
In large quantities it induces
paralysis and immobilisation of the
nervous system.

745
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,240
That confirms it. She's in on it
too. It would appear so.

746
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,440
Such an eventuality, it is tragic,
non?

747
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,240
To think that it is possible that
such a woman...

748
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,340
Never mind that.
We're making progress at last.

749
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,360
We've identified Number Three of the
Big Four.

750
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,380
Oui.

751
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,860
MRS ANDREWS: You'll find everything
exactly as it was.

752
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,940
Until you catch the fellow who done
it, I'm not allowed to touch a thing.

753
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,960
And there remains no word
from the nephew of Monsieur Whalley?

754
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,980
He does not return to claim his
inheritance?

755
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,980
No. Not that I'm surprised.

756
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,840
I mean, who'd want to live here
knowing what had happened?

757
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
I wish he would show up, though.

758
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,960
There's boxes of junk just sitting
up there.

759
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,900
Madame, you said before that he and
his uncle, they did not get on?

760
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,040
So I gather. Before my time, as I
say

761
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,980
And what became of him, madame?

762
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,980
Oh. Lived here till he was in his
20s, I think.

763
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,880
And then...

764
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,040
Maybe he went off and joined the
circus.

765
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,900
Just give me a shout when you're
done.

766
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,820
Merci, madame.

767
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,020
Oh, no, not again.
Just give it to me later, Reg.

768
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,980
They're for you.

769
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,940
How lovely.

770
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,820
"My darling Flossie.

771
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,980
Soon our time will come.

772
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
4 kisses."

773
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
(SOUNDTRACK OVER DIALOGUE)

774
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,940
Of course, there's no grace
about the profession these days.

775
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,020
These young actors and actresses,
they can't project.

776
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,880
They're used to speaking into a
microphone for the wireless or for
the talking pictures.

777
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,880
The profession can be a very cruel
place.

778
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,840
Especially when
the first bloom of youth has gone.

779
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,820
Do you go to the theatre, Mr Poirot?

780
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,000
Yes, indeed.
Well, then, you must have seen me.

781
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,860
I got wonderful reviews
for my Eliza Doolittle.

782
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,900
"A confident and dazzling Miss
Flossie Monro."

783
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,820
No.
No?

784
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,940
Well, I did The Importance Of Being
Earnest at the Vaudeville in '26.

785
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,940
I had a great success with that.
No

786
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,900
Perhaps something more recent.
More recent.

787
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,020
Well, let me think.

788
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,940
I was at the Duke of York's a few
years ago in Share My Cab, but...

789
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,840
Oh, yes, indeed. This Poirot did
see. What did you play?

790
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,920
The accordion.

791
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,940
For some years ago you appeared
in a repertory theatre company,
madame.

792
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,940
Moiselle.
Pardon, mademoiselle.

793
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,800
The Methuselah Players.
Yes!

794
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,940
How on earth do you know about that?
Oh! They were happy times.

795
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,020
I have been speaking
to some of your fellow actors

796
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,960
and they tell to me that this
company closed down not long after
that season.

797
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,860
Yes, such a shame.

798
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,980
Oh, thank you.

799
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,800
Mm.
Merci.

800
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,800
Does the name Albert Whalley
mean anything to you?

801
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,820
Whalley?

802
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,860
No, no, I don't think so. Why, should
it?

803
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,820
No, it appears
that he was a member of the audience

804
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,900
very devoted to the Methuselah
company.

805
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,860
In fact, he collected mementoes
from the repertory season in 1924.

806
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,960
Oh, a fan, was he? Oh.

807
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,820
Well, really, Mr Poirot,

808
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,980
you can't expect me to remember
all my admirers over all these years.

809
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,940
Non, mademoiselle?
No.

810
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,020
For instance, only this past few
weeks I've been sent all sorts of
things.

811
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,820
Cards, flowers, champagne.

812
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,820
All from an anonymous admirer.
Vraiment?

813
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,960
This arrived just the other day.

814
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,940
A valentine in April?
Yes, I thought it was queer too.

815
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,820
But you know what some of these fans
can be like.

816
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,840
You permit Poirot to see?

817
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Merci, mademoiselle.

818
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
"Until we meet again."
Mm.

819
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
(PHONE RINGS)

820
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Hercule Poirot speaks.

821
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,820
Oui, monsieur, an interview, it is
possible.

822
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,020
Bon. What is your address, monsieur?

823
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,820
What a difference a few weeks make.

824
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Quite, sir.

825
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:25,660
I sent away that journalist fellow
with a flea in his ear

826
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,680
and now it seems he was right after
all.

827
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,740
Bulldog Drummond come to life.

828
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,840
HASTINGS: And the best of men lies
dead.

829
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,620
Monsieur Poirot was a brilliant man.

830
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,600
Lord knows we could do
with more like him at this moment.

831
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,680
HASTINGS:
Is there any hope for peace, sir?

832
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,780
This Big Four business
has the entire international
community on edge.

833
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,820
Do you have anything concrete to go
on, sir?

834
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,700
Nothing.

835
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,840
Li Chang Yen has put out a statement
denying any knowledge of the Big
Four.

836
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,620
He would, wouldn't he?

837
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,740
HASTINGS: Ryland and Madame Olivier
are still nowhere to be seen.

838
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,700
What about Number Four?
Indeed.

839
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,740
How does one track down Death
himself?

840
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
Poirot knew.

841
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,840
If only we could find out what
knowledge he took with him to his
grave.

842
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,740
He always liked things just so,
didn't he?

843
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,620
Quite.

844
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,740
He was onto something, wasn't he?
He had to be.

845
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,580
I only wish I knew what.

846
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,780
I've been so wrapped up with all
these new leads that have been
coming in.

847
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,740
Poirot seemed quite content to go
off and pursue things on his own.

848
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,700
I suppose he must have grown
quite used to that.

849
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,660
Yes, I suppose so.
One thing we know for certain.

850
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,660
He was getting too close to the Big
Four, so they eliminated him.

851
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,660
Yes.
Well?

852
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,800
Well?
Well, hang it all, Japp.

853
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,760
What are we going to do next?
Eh?

854
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,680
We can't let Poirot die in vain.
We've got to stop them.

855
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,780
Now, hang on, Captain Hastings.
We can't be faint-hearted now, man.

856
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,700
Are you with me or not?

857
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,680
For Poirot's sake,
together we have to stop the Big
Four.

858
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,580
Listen, these people mean business.

859
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,620
They'll stop at nothing.
If even Poirot couldn't stop them.

860
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,820
Good Lord, man. I never thought
I'd hear such conchie talk from you.

861
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,740
Well, if you won't do anything
to stop these brutes, then I
certainly will.

862
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,760
And I'll leave no stone unturned.
Good day.

863
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,800
So...what do I do now, old chap?

864
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,760
Good old Hastings.

865
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,840
Old soldiers never die, Mr Japp.

866
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,740
Sir.
Yes, George? What is it?

867
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,600
A telegram has arrived for you,
sir. For me?

868
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,820
Hello?

869
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,600
Anybody here?

870
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,780
Oh.

871
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,660
It's... It's Miss Monro. I've come
for the audition.

872
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,800
It's funny, I was just talking about
this place to someone the other day.

873
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,680
Strange to be back here after all
this time.

874
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,640
I'm not late, am I? Your letter did
say four.

875
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,680
Hello?

876
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,620
Help... Help me.

877
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,640
Please.

878
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
What's going on?

879
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,740
What do you want with me?
Welcome, Miss Monro.

880
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,660
Welcome to the lair of the Big Four.

881
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,840
Oh, my God.

882
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,660
You've heard of us. How gratifying.

883
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,640
Talk to me, Miss Monro.
Tell me all you know about the Big
Four.

884
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,840
I don't understand. Why...?
Waiting, Miss Monro.

885
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,760
You wouldn't want to disappoint me,
would you?

886
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,840
I only know what I've seen in the
papers.

887
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,800
What have you read in the papers?

888
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:09,620
Well...it's all run from China, isn't
it?

889
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,800
Number One. Go on.

890
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,700
Um...then there's that American
with all the money.

891
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,840
Number Two.

892
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,640
(GASPS)
Continue.

893
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Please, I...
Continue!

894
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,740
The French woman. Um...

895
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,660
Madame...

896
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,820
Madame Olivier.

897
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,640
Number Three.

898
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,680
And Number Four.

899
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
Tell me what you know of Number
Four.

900
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,600
Nobody knows, do they?

901
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,680
Are you Number Four?
(LAUGHS)

902
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,680
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

903
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,780
(GASPS)

904
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
Think back, my darling.

905
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,740
It has been some time.

906
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,740
Do I...know you?

907
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,580
All my gifts,

908
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:30,760
the cards, the roses,
they didn't bring back any memories?

909
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,700
You're my admirer? You're...you're my
fan?

910
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,640
Think, Flossie.
Think back to that season at this
old theatre.

911
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,660
15 years ago.

912
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,640
We performed together on this very
stage.

913
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:54,660
Claud.

914
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,680
Claud Darrell? It's...

915
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,660
Is it really you?

916
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,760
It is, my love.

917
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,660
Well, what's this all about, Claud? I
mean...

918
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,660
It's just a joke. It's just a silly
joke.

919
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,820
No, my dear. It's serious. Deadly
serious.

920
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,680
I adore you, Flossie. Don't you
realise that?

921
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,660
I'd do anything for you.

922
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,800
I've done so much already.

923
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,780
All for you.

924
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,660
Do you remember
what you said to me on that day?

925
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,780
What day? It was years ago, years.

926
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,720
I can never forget it, you know.

927
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,740
I asked you if I could take you
out to dinner and you said...

928
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,740
Oh, Claudie. Don't be so ridiculous.

929
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,620
As if I could fancy someone like you.

930
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,740
You're such a funny little shrimp,
aren't you?

931
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,760
No, I deserve the best, Claudie.

932
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:05,660
Someone who's gonna
make something of himself.

933
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,680
Someone the whole world will
remember.

934
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,680
Someone the whole world would
remember.

935
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,700
But I was young, wasn't I?
I was young and foolish and full of
myself.

936
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,820
The whole world will remember me
now, won't they?

937
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,660
The whole world will remember the
Big Four.

938
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,780
Li Chang Yen, Abe Ryland,
Regine Olivier and me.

939
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,780
Claud Darrell. Number Four.

940
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,620
The Destroyer.

941
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,740
Death himself.

942
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,800
You mean you've done all of this,

943
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,820
all of this...

944
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,660
..just for me?

945
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,660
Tell me you love me, Flossie.

946
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,820
Tell me you love me.

947
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,680
Tell me.

948
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:17,660
I think you're the most remarkable
man... I've ever met.

949
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,840
Let me take you away from here.

950
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,720
Just... Just one thing to take care
of first.

951
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,620
POIROT: I think not, monsieur.

952
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,680
(GASPS)

953
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,780
Oui, monsieur.

954
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,700
Despite the best efforts of the Big
Four,

955
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,660
Hercule Poirot, he lives.

956
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,460
You're dead. Dead and buried.

957
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,520
Non.

958
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,480
It was all smoke and mirrors.

959
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,440
Is that not the expression?

960
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:33,360
But now it is time to bring down the
curtain on the Big Four.

961
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,420
I rather think that'll be my
decision. All right, son, the game's
up.

962
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,400
You've pulled off some stunts in
your time, Poirot, but this beats
them all.

963
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,440
I should say.

964
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:49,540
I have much to explain to you, mes
amis, but first, if you please,
mademoiselle.

965
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,300
Flossie.

966
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,380
Flossie.

967
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,480
Come on.

968
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,420
I think you'd better sit down, sir.

969
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:18,320
What about these two?
Shouldn't we do something in case
they...

970
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,480
What's the matter with them?

971
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,420
One moment, mon ami.

972
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,420
What a pass in which we find
ourselves.

973
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,400
The world stands on the brink
of a conflict most terrible.

974
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,440
And what do we discover is behind it
all,

975
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,540
fomenting suspicion on a scale that
is global?

976
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,440
A cabal most terrifying.

977
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,500
Puppet masters who threaten
to plunge the world into war.

978
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,480
And yet, and yet...

979
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:54,320
What was the first reaction
of anyone who was told of the Big
Four?

980
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,440
That it was like something from a
storybook, n'est pas?

981
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,500
Bulldog Drummond.

982
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,420
Precisement, Monsieur Tysoe,
precisement.

983
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,340
Because that is all it is, mes amis.

984
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,540
Mere theatre. The Big Four are not
real. Non.

985
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,440
They exist only in the crazed
imagination of one man.

986
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,480
That's not possible.

987
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:26,420
A man who would plunge the world
into chaos because of a passion that
is unrequited.

988
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:35,300
Albert Whalley, who was later to
take on the stage name of Claud
Darrell

989
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:41,360
and who for the past few months
has been masquerading as Dr Quentin.

990
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,540
But what about Li Chang Yen? And
these two?

991
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,380
Li Chang Yen is as innocent as he
claims.

992
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:52,340
And these poor unfortunate souls
are merely pawns in the game,

993
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,300
kidnapped and kept here,

994
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,340
their disappearances orchestrated
to throw suspicion onto them.

995
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,360
But why don't they say anything?
Because they are drugged, mon ami.

996
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,480
Drugged with gelsemine.
Good grief.

997
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,280
Oui.

998
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,440
The same drug that was used to
anaesthetise Stephen Paynter before
he was killed.

999
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:14,340
They are fully conscious,
but their physical paralysis, it is
complete.

1000
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,440
But mercifully, it would appear in
this case,

1001
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,360
the effect, it is only temporary,
mon ami.

1002
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:26,460
Everyone believed it, though,
didn't they, the Big Four?

1003
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:30,440
Fleet Street, the police, the great
British public.

1004
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:35,440
Oui, monsieur, for some time even
Hercule Poirot was taken in by your
charade so deadly.

1005
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,440
With your help, of course, Mr Tysoe.

1006
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,400
What?

1007
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,540
I just had to wind you up like a
clockwork toy
and off you went.

1008
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,320
You and your little newspaper.

1009
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:54,320
Spreading fear, confusion, hate.

1010
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,440
An emotional soup, pulsing.

1011
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,380
You really have been a most useful
ally.

1012
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,420
But my informer?

1013
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,340
The letters? The playing cards?

1014
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,460
All sent from Monsieur Darrell.

1015
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,340
So the fella who turned up
with a knife in his back?

1016
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,480
In reality a tramp
dressed in a theatrical costume,

1017
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,300
the clues of the playing cards
planted upon him.

1018
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,440
Reality, Monsieur Poirot? Who is to
say where fantasy ends and reality
begins?

1019
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,480
Well, let us speak of beginnings,
monsieur!

1020
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,340
Act One of a drama so very strange.

1021
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
Albert Whalley.

1022
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,320
A boy,

1023
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,440
an orphan,

1024
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,540
poor and unloved...

1025
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,480
...who was sent away to live with
his uncle who was cold and aloof.

1026
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,420
Albert Whalley is a name I haven't
used in years.

1027
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,460
Non, but an uncle
who disapproved of your fantasies

1028
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,540
and your desire to tread the boards.

1029
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,280
All those years
of listening to that old fool.

1030
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:13,300
Going on about his precious
Chinaman, Li Chang Yen.

1031
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,400
I began to see possibilities.
Oui.

1032
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,460
But then you had
the task most difficult, non?

1033
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:24,360
To worm your way into the
confidences of the members of the
Peace Party.

1034
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,540
Child's play.

1035
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,540
I forged my references and quietly
took up my position as Dr Quentin.

1036
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:34,480
Paynter's condition,
it's not really very difficult to
research.

1037
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,360
I'm an actor, Monsieur Poirot,
and a bloody good one.

1038
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,500
Oh, yes, indeed, monsieur,
your ability to blend in,

1039
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:45,360
to pass yourself off in all manner
of disguises, which has proven so
useful.

1040
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:50,340
You have the genius
of the character actor.

1041
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,320
Help! No! No!

1042
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,340
(SCREAMS)

1043
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,540
Mr Tysoe!

1044
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,540
Savaranoff was killed to implicate
Abe Ryland.

1045
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,360
Your uncle died to throw suspicion
onto Li Chang Yen.

1046
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:56,440
And Stephen Paynter, who was
innocent,

1047
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,300
murdered to incriminate Madame
Olivier.

1048
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,340
He was a weak fool.
His weakness was his conscience.

1049
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:10,340
I merely persuaded him that it
wasn't decent for them to continue
their silly love affair.

1050
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,320
That's all it was, then? Diana
Paynter overheard him ending the
affair?

1051
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,480
It had nothing to do with the Big
Four?

1052
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,540
Indeed so, mon ami.
TYSOE: But why?

1053
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,520
In God's name,
what the hell was it all for?

1054
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,540
For me.

1055
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,420
Wasn't it, Mr Poirot?

1056
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,340
Oui, mademoiselle.

1057
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:37,380
For the woman who spurned him
all those years ago.

1058
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:43,360
For therein lies your tragedy,
Monsieur Darrell.

1059
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:48,540
The very gift that could have turned
you into the actor supreme...makes
you forgettable.

1060
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,340
The man who blends in.

1061
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,400
The man whose name
nobody ever can quite remember.

1062
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,460
The man who...disappears.

1063
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,500
Albert Whalley, Claud Darrell,

1064
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,340
Dr Quentin, Number Four.

1065
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,360
Whatever you choose
to call yourself, monsieur,

1066
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,420
you adore the flourish that is
theatrical.

1067
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,540
You've got a nerve.

1068
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,400
Comment?

1069
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:27,440
All this. You'd already worked out
where I was.

1070
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,320
You could have sent the police
to arrest me at any time.

1071
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,360
But instead you wanted your grand
finale,

1072
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,360
show everyone just how clever you've
been.

1073
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,420
Oh, we're more alike than you think,
Poirot.

1074
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,540
Sit down!
(GUNSHOT)

1075
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,540
Nobody moves!
Don't be a fool, Darrell.

1076
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,480
You'll never get away.
My men are surrounding the building.

1077
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,540
If Flossie won't have me,

1078
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,420
then we're all going to go out
in a blaze of glory.

1079
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,460
Oh, my God.

1080
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,380
Poirot, we've got to get everybody
out of here.

1081
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,480
One minute.

1082
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,380
One minute...

1083
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:20,340
...before I bring down the final
curtain on the Big Four.

1084
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,440
Poirot.
You will not do it, monsieur.

1085
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:29,380
To do all this
for the love of one woman.

1086
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:35,320
You will not send her to her grave,
Albert Whalley.

1087
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,340
You cannot.

1088
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,320
(MOUTHS)

1089
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,420
It's all right. It's all right, son.

1090
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,480
It's all right.

1091
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,380
You've spoilt everything!

1092
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,420
You've spoilt it all,
you insufferable little man!

1093
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,500
But I am Number Four, do you hear
me?

1094
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,300
The Destroyer.

1095
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,360
Death itself.

1096
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,360
He's dead.

1097
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,420
(REPORTERS ALL SPEAK AT ONCE)

1098
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,300
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1099
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:13,320
It is a source of great relief
that after our terrible ordeal

1100
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:18,320
we are able to clear not only our own
reputations but that of the party as
well.

1101
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,400
RYLAND: Indeed.

1102
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,520
Li Chang Yen wants to reassure
every civilised nation

1103
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,420
that we will continue to strive for
world peace.

1104
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,360
The Big Four
has proved to be a fiction,

1105
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:33,480
but still we stand on a precipice.

1106
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,500
RYLAND: The situation remains grim,

1107
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:43,340
but if war does come,
the powers of light will be united
as one.

1108
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:49,440
I will have to eat some humble pie,
naturally.

1109
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:52,480
But I do have the exclusive story
of Number Four to write,

1110
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,380
so that's some consolation.

1111
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,440
Thanks for the opportunity
to be in at the end, Mr Poirot.

1112
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:03,360
I hope you've learned your lesson,
mate. Check your facts before you
print.

1113
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:07,420
Incidentally, how did you work it
all out?

1114
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:15,320
It occurred to Poirot for some time
that this case had the flavour of the
theatre.

1115
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:19,380
And the label of the costumier,
Max Berman & Sons

1116
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,480
was the first mistake
of Monsieur Claud Darrell.

1117
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,540
His scrapbook led me
towards Mademoiselle Monro.

1118
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:30,340
Of course, naturellement,
he kept his eye most closely upon
her,

1119
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:35,340
but when she met with me,
Hercule Poirot, he panicked.

1120
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:38,340
(PHONE RINGS)

1121
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,440
Hercule Poirot speaks.

1122
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:44,280
I understand you've been trying to
contact me. My name is Claud
Darrell.

1123
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,360
Yes, indeed, monsieur,

1124
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,340
in connection with your time
at the Methuselah Theatre.

1125
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,480
An interview, it is possible?
Certainly.

1126
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,320
I can spare you a moment or two
later on this afternoon.

1127
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,400
Bon. What is your address, monsieur?

1128
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:58,500
Flat A, 41 Wilberforce Road,
Islington.

1129
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,440
At what hour?
Shall we say four?

1130
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,460
Parfait. Au revoir.

1131
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,460
But I hoped that even if for one
moment Monsieur Claud Darrell could
believe

1132
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,280
that his plan had succeeded,
then the subsequent realisation of
his failure

1133
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,460
would be all the more devastating.

1134
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:00,420
And Hercule Poirot,
he was proved correct.

1135
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,320
I still can't quite believe
I managed to do it,

1136
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,480
convince him I was in love with him.

1137
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,360
I warned Mademoiselle Monro
that she would need courage

1138
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,360
and that it might prove to be most
dangerous.

1139
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,540
But when the moment it came
that Claud Darrell

1140
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,480
were to make contact with her again,
as I knew that he would,

1141
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,340
we must be ready, oui?

1142
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,400
It was the performance of a lifetime,
mademoiselle.

1143
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,400
I had a wonderful director, Mr
Poirot.

1144
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,500
Merci.

1145
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:35,460
Well, delightful as this all is,
I need to get on and write my
column.

1146
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,300
I don't suppose you'd be interested
in giving me an exclusive interview?

1147
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,460
"The woman who stole the heart
of Number Four"?

1148
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,480
Perhaps.

1149
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:53,360
Maybe we could discuss it further,
over lunch.

1150
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,300
Don't mind if I do.

1151
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,440
The performance of a lifetime
certainly gives a girl an appetite.

1152
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,500
So where do you fancy?
Simpson's is lovely.

1153
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,520
I've not been there for a while.
Or we could go dancing.

1154
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,540
Mes amis?

1155
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,480
Well, Poirot, we're...we're pleased,

1156
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:20,480
you know, that...you're not,
you know, dead.

1157
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,360
Of course we are, but...

1158
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,300
But why did you go through
with this horrid charade,

1159
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,280
making us believe you'd been killed?

1160
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:34,440
But it was vital, Miss Lemon,
vital that you should believe it.

1161
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,440
It was necessary for Poirot to
disappear,

1162
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:40,360
because in this way, the guard of
Number Four, it would be dropped.

1163
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,360
George?

1164
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,320
I'm sure you had the best
intentions, sir.

1165
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,340
No man is a hero to his valet.

1166
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:56,380
Can you ever forgive me, mes amis?

1167
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:01,340
It was all for the best...

1168
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,500
..I suppose.

1169
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,480
But you know this affair of the Big
Four, it has done some other good.

1170
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:12,500
Has it not reunited me
with all my oldest friends?

1171
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,440
Almost all.

1172
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,360
Because where is Hastings?
Where is Captain Hastings?

1173
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,520
Well, there's been no sign of him
since he charged off, I'm afraid.

1174
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:24,520
Surely he must have heard the news
by now.

1175
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,460
(DOORS OPENS AND CLOSES)

1176
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,340
Good Lord. Poirot.

1177
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,400
I thought you were dead.

1178
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,420
Mon ami, Hastings.

1179
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,300
Mon ami, mon ami.

1180
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,340
It is the most extraordinary thing.

1181
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,460
I was only saying...
