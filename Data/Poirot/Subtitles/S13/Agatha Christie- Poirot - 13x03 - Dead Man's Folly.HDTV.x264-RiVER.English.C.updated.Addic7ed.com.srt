1
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,240
Welcome, Sir George, Lady Stubbs.

2
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,500
- Good evening, Sir George.
- Good evening.

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,480
I'm so thankful you're here at last.

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,560
A shocking night.

5
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,500
Hattie should get straight to bed
or she'll catch a chill.

6
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,720
Come along, my dear.

7
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,740
"Come at once, Nasse House, Devon.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Need help. Urgent.

9
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Ariadne Oliver."

10
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,640
You been here before, sir?

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,600
Non. Take the scenic route
along the river, shall I?

12
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,620
Non, merci.

13
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,720
Afternoon, ladies.

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,740
You don't mind, do you, sir?
Foreigners, see. Can't read a map.

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Buongiorno.
Mademoiselle.

16
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,620
Thank you. It is most kind, please.

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,720
Grazie.
Miles yet to the youth hostel.

18
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,680
Oh, her is not speak English.

19
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,540
We meet first time this morning
on the platform at Exeter.

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
And now we are big friends.

21
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,600
We explore Devon together.

22
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,740
I could show you a few beauty spots,
if you like.

23
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,520
The hostel's that way. Don't
cross Sir George's land, though.
He don't like it.

24
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,540
Grazie, mille.

25
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,660
Thank you, Stan.

26
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
If you please, may we hurry?

27
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,520
Welcome to Nasse, monsieur.

28
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,700
I believe Mrs Oliver to be down by
the battery, sir, that way.

29
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,540
Help, help! Someone, quick!

30
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,620
Help! Help!

31
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,720
Help! Help!

32
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Someone, quick!

33
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh, hello, Poirot.

34
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,560
What is wrong, madame?

35
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,720
Nothing's wrong.

36
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,600
I just wanted to see if someone
would come.

37
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,680
How loudly one might have to shout.
These woods are frightfully dense.

38
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,600
I thought you were in danger!
Certainly not.

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
How are you, Poirot?

40
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,700
Un peu enerve, cher madame.

41
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,680
You telegrammed to me that you need
help

42
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
and for this reason I come by the
express from London.

43
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,580
Well...

44
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,560
I do need help.

45
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,580
I'm most awfully worried.

46
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,640
There are some very strange people
here.

47
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Very strange indeed.

48
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,720
They're holding a fete tomorrow
and thought they'd have a treasure
hunt.

49
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,560
Then they thought,
"No, that's been done to death."

50
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,560
So they thought
they'd have a murder hunt instead.

51
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,540
And they offered me a tidy sum
to come and dream it up.

52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Well, anything's better than
writing.

53
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,720
So I've been busily inventing
motives and suspects and victims
and so forth.

54
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,560
It costs a bob to enter and all
you get for that is the first clue.

55
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,740
Good fun.
Madame...

56
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,640
Poirot, he is arrived to Devon, mais
pourquoi?

57
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,600
Because there's something amiss.

58
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
I think someone's going to die.

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,680
If there were to be a real murder
tomorrow instead of a fake one,

60
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
I shouldn't be in the least
surprised.

61
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,520
Whose idea was it, this murder hunt?

62
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,560
The Warburtons, I think.
The owners of the property?

63
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
No, no, that's Sir George Stubbs.

64
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,560
Awfully rich and awfully common.

65
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,600
Bought the place a year or so ago,
along with his wife...

66
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,600
who's outrageously beautiful.

67
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
But as dumb as a fish.

68
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,680
The corpse will be in here.

69
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Sally Legge was going to do it,

70
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,580
but now they want her to dress up in
a turban and tell fortunes.

71
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,720
So it's a Girl Guide called
Marlene Tucker.

72
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,640
Hideous child!

73
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,700
Just has to sit here and read
comics...

74
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,500
I've written a clue on one of them.

75
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,600
..and flop down when she hears
someone coming with this around her
neck.

76
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,560
Hello. I've brought lemonade.

77
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh, that is most kind, Miss Brewis.

78
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,660
Good afternoon, sir.
Mademoiselle.

79
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,520
Lady Stubbs must be rushed off her
feet with all the preparations. Do
thank her for the drinks.

80
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,560
Lady Stubbs has one of her
headaches.

81
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,540
She's not yet up.

82
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,680
I've planned every detail
and it all dovetails nicely.

83
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
But things keep changing.

84
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,720
The fortune-telling's a good example.

85
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,720
I feel I'm being jockeyed along.

86
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,500
"Jockeyed along"?
Manipulated.

87
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,720
So someone is making the suggestions?

88
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
I just can't stand suggestions.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,520
If you suggest something,
we do exactly the opposite.

90
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,520
But I am being jockeyed along.

91
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540
And I can't figure out how.

92
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
To tell the truth, I'm worried.

93
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,560
Perhaps the big suggestion it is
put, hein?

94
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,680
To which you, of course, say no,
because it is preposterous.

95
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,680
But then an idea most trivial may be
found to have been smuggled in.

96
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Yes, yes, something like that. Yes.

97
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Who is making these alterations?

98
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,620
Different people. It would be easier
if it were just one, wouldn't it?

99
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,660
And you have told to them that
Hercule Poirot, he is coming?

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,620
Yes, I said you'd be giving away
the prizes for the murder hunt.
Everyone's thrilled.

101
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,720
Mrs Oliver! Hang on,
I'll walk up with you.

102
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,540
All safe, sir.

103
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,520
That's Michael Weyman.

104
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,740
An architect.

105
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm meant to be designing a tennis
pavilion. Do you know what he's
asked for?

106
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
A Chinese pagoda.

107
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Selfmade men!

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Stinking with money
but with no taste whatsoever.

109
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,520
For instance, look at this.

110
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,520
It's quite nice of its kind...

111
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
well, in keeping with the house.

112
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,640
But these things are meant to be...

113
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
What's the phrase?

114
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,640
..situated on an eminence.

115
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,560
And here's this poor little devil
tucked away in the woods.

116
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,680
Perhaps there wasn't anywhere else?

117
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,640
What about the grassy bank by
the house? It's perfect, but no.

118
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,600
A tree comes down in a gale.

119
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,580
"Right," says the selfmade twerp,
"We'll put the folly there,
tidy up the place."

120
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,580
It's only on a yard of concrete,
subsiding already.

121
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,580
These people are extraordinary.

122
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
That's Amy Folliat.

123
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,700
Here people owned Nasse originally.

124
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,740
Then she lost both her sons
and had to sell up.

125
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,680
And yet she lives here still?

126
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,600
Precisely.

127
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,560
Odd or what?

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,560
Is this the great Monsieur Poirot?

129
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,560
Enchante, Madame Folliat.

130
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,520
It is kind of you to help out with
our prizes.

131
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,600
This clever lady has contrived
a most intricate problem.

132
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,620
I have been admiring the house.

133
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,740
I thank you.

134
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,640
It was built by my husband's
greatgrandfather.

135
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,720
There was an Elizabethan manor
before.

136
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,660
But it burnt down.

137
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,620
It must be hard for you to have
strangers living in residence now.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
So many things are hard, monsieur.

139
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,480
If you'll excuse me, I'll see if
they have your room ready.

140
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
What do you think?

141
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,640
Comment?

142
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,520
It is only one instant since I have
arrived!

143
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,580
Well, I've been here three days.

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
And every time someone says
something, I get the strongest
impression they're lying.

145
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,520
My intuition tells me something is
wrong.

146
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,660
Ah, la.

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,740
I'm well aware you think me
irrational.

148
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,500
Madame, one calls things by
different names, hein?

149
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,520
It may indeed be that you have seen
something,

150
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,720
it may indeed be
that you have heard something.

151
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,620
And it may be...if I may so put it...

152
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,520
..that you do not know what it is
that you know.

153
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,700
You are aware only of the result.

154
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,520
And that, madame,
it is your intuition.

155
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,720
Whatever it is,

156
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,500
I feel certain someone is going to
die.

157
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
We must do something about it.

158
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,520
Poirot, is it?

159
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,520
Welcome. Welcome, old man.

160
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,560
Merci, monsieur.
George Stubbs.

161
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,600
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Delighted you could come.

162
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,520
Ah, yes. Let me introduce you to
some people.

163
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,680
The fortunetelling.

164
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Over by the magnolia or at the far
end of the lawn by the
rhododendrons?

165
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,600
By the magnolia.

166
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,640
My tent can't go by the magnolia,
it will cause a bottleneck.

167
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,720
Rubbish!
Down at the end, please, Captain.

168
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,540
What about the coconut shy?

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,520
Not too near the house, Jim.
I've just replaced the windows.

170
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,680
Fair point.

171
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,600
Now, may I introduce the famous
gent, Hercule Poirot.

172
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,520
Yes, indeed, Monsieur Poirot.

173
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,640
Captain and Mrs Warburton.
Captain.

174
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,560
Delighted.
Madame.

175
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
And Alec and Sally Legge.

176
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,540
Monsieur. Madame.

177
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680
We'll find you a job later on.

178
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,680
Watch out, Poirot. Sally can make a
man do anything, what!

179
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Come and meet the wife.

180
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Excuse me.
Hattie.

181
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,720
This is Mr Poirot, he's our guest.

182
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,560
Madame.

183
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,560
You chat nicely while I go
and locate some coconuts.

184
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Bon.
Right.

185
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,560
Do you mind if I sit down, madame?
So much walking.

186
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,640
Merci.

187
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,560
It's pretty, isn't it?
Tres jolie.

188
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,480
It's an emerald.

189
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,640
George gave it to me,
he gives me lots of things.

190
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,580
Devonshire is a county most pleasant,
n'estce pas?

191
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
It is when it isn't raining
but there aren't any nightclubs.

192
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,700
Ah, bon, you like the nightclub?
Oh, yes.

193
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I love music and dancing
and champagne

194
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,660
and wearing my nicest clothes
and all my jewels.

195
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,720
It's best to be rich, isn't it?

196
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,640
Perhaps if I was not rich,
I should look like her.

197
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,560
Imagine.

198
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,560
Tea, my lady.

199
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,560
Tea is stupid.

200
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,680
Perhaps our guest would like some,
Hattie.

201
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,620
Shall I be Mother?

202
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,500
Is it going to be like Ascot
tomorrow? I can wear a very big hat.

203
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Not quite like Ascot, dear.

204
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,720
There's so much to do.

205
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,480
You really should be helping out
instead of staying in bed till
after lunch.

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,600
I've got a new dress. Come and see.

207
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
We're just having a cup of tea.

208
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,700
Come with me, come now.
Oh, very well.

209
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Please excuse us.

210
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,560
You really must try to be more
polite.

211
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,640
Beautiful creature, isn't she?
Oui.

212
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,680
See that ring that George bought
her?

213
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,720
Whether he spotted she's away with
the fairies, I couldn't say.

214
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,700
But then he's hardly an intellectual
himself, is he?

215
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,740
Sir George, he's inside the stocks
and shares, I believe?

216
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,680
Yes. Not exactly a gentleman's game,
what?

217
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,520
But still, you are the friends?

218
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Good grief, no choice.
Not with an election coming up.

219
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,560
Jim, you've got to settle this.

220
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,540
We agreed my tent should be at the
far end by the rhododendrons,
it's the only place.

221
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,500
My wife doesn't think so.

222
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,680
You're the Member of Parliament.
Show her who's boss.

223
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Are you out of your mind?
All right, I'll see what I can do.

224
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,600
Have you seen Amy Folliat?

225
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,740
I believe that Madame Folliat
is inside with the Lady Stubbs.

226
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,600
She seems to be most solicitous
towards her.

227
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,700
Ah, yes, well,
she was Hattie's guardian.

228
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,740
Before I walked her up the aisle,
of course.

229
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,520
Her people were in sugar in the
Caribbean.

230
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,540
But there was a typhus epidemic
and both her mother and father lost
their lives.

231
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Rotten bloody luck, actually.

232
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,520
But Amy Folliat was a friend of the
family and took young Hattie under
the wing.

233
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,660
Oh, that is commendable.
She's a damn good egg, actually.

234
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,660
Ah, Amanda. I want you to go
and order some wire fencing
straightaway, please.

235
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,720
I don't think you're allowed to pen
people in the tea tent, sir.

236
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
Not the tea tent, dear, no.

237
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,700
Over in the woods,
where they're coming through.
They keep wandering in.

238
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Who are?
Trespassers!

239
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,640
Foreigners, cutting through, you
see, Poirot, through to the ferry.

240
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,700
Girls in little short trousers.

241
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
Oui, d'accord. The trousers of the
girls are... Exactly.

242
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,740
I have a gentleman on the telephone
with coconuts.

243
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Right, the coconuts, yes.

244
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Right, so, how many's he got?
As many as you like, sir.

245
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Look at them all buzzing around.

246
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Busy, busy bees.

247
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,740
The world's going to pot
and they're holding a garden party.

248
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,680
Une fete de jardin?

249
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,640
But that is an activity honoured by
time, monsieur.

250
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,640
The apathy of these people.

251
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
They're all feeble-minded.

252
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Do you know what I should like to
see done in this country?

253
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,560
I'd like to see every feeble-minded
person put out.

254
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Don't let them breed.

255
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Finish them off, all the simpletons.

256
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,660
How would you do that, Monsieur
Legge?

257
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Oh, I'm a chemist.

258
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
I could do it easily.

259
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,700
Any theories?

260
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
Everybody seems to me
to be completely normal.

261
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,680
Are you trying to be amusing?

262
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Perhaps that is not the right word.

263
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,520
Lady Stubbs, it appears,
is subnormal, Alec Legge abnormal.

264
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,720
He's all right. He's just having a
nervous breakdown.

265
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,580
But everyone seems in a state of
agitation,

266
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,640
which, I believe, is characteristic
of the preparations for a fete in
England.

267
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,560
Mrs Oliver, your corpse is here.

268
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Ah, hello, Marlene.

269
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,520
Remember, a Guide is honest,
reliable and can be trusted.

270
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,600
Can you come and have a look at her
costume?

271
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
I was going to be stabbed.

272
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Now she says I'm gonna be strangled.

273
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,740
That's not fair.

274
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,620
This gentleman knows all about
murder. Why don't you ask him?

275
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Seen a lot of killings, have you?

276
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
One or two, mademoiselle, oui.

277
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Any sex maniacs?

278
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,680
I like sex maniacs,
I've read about them.

279
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,520
I do not think you would like to meet
one.

280
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,520
If someone leaves a woman's body in
the woods with no clothes on, dead,
like...

281
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,600
he's liable to be a sex maniac,
ain't he?

282
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,540
That would be an assumption
most reasonable, oui.

283
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,680
That's what my granddad said.

284
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,560
But he's daft
so no one believes him.

285
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Marlene, come and try your
costume.

286
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,520
Hattie, come back!

287
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
You're completely mad!

288
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You permit, madame?

289
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,580
Oh.

290
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,740
I'm so sorry Hattie dragged me off
earlier. It was rude of her.

291
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Lady Stubbs is a little...

292
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Comment on dit?

293
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,600
..capricious?

294
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Hattie is a dear good child.

295
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
I know her very well, you see.

296
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Because she was once your ward?

297
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
My husband died in Flanders.

298
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,520
My elder son was killed on active
service against the Pashtun.

299
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
And to cap a sorry tale,

300
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,700
my...younger son took up aviation.

301
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,700
And crashed trying
to break the record to Nairobi.

302
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,580
That meant three lots of death
duties.

303
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,640
Well...

304
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Nasse had to be sold.

305
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,660
I was very unhappy
and I was glad of the distraction

306
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,700
of having a young person to look
after.

307
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
For a time, we lived in Paris.

308
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
My, we had fun.

309
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
I became very fond of Hattie.

310
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,740
All the more so when I realised
that she was not terribly...

311
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,660
..capable.

312
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,740
Thank heaven there was no money to
speak of.

313
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,580
Had she been an heiress,
I dread to think how vulnerable
she might have been.

314
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,600
Her father died bankrupt.

315
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,640
And we felt ourselves fortunate
when George Stubbs came along.

316
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
It was most fortunate indeed.

317
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
George Stubbs is a good man.

318
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,560
Oh, I know he's a complete
vulgarian.

319
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,720
But he is fundamentally decent.

320
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,560
Oui, I think that you have made
the arrangement most prudent, madame.

321
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,520
I am not like the English,
a romantic about these matters.

322
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,660
Et voici, here you are, still at
Nasse House.

323
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,740
Sir George lets me live in the
lodge.

324
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
And I count myself very lucky.

325
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,620
Indeed, you have found for yourself
a haven most peaceful, madame.

326
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,520
A haven from the storm.

327
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,500
Yes.

328
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,520
The world is a wicked place,
Monsieur Poirot.

329
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
There are very wicked people in it.

330
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,640
Thank you.

331
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,520
What do you want me to put on this
poster?

332
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,680
Madam Zuleika, or Romany Lee,
Gypsy Queen?

333
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
No one likes gypsies round here.

334
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,520
Better make it Madam Zuleika.

335
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,560
With a snake around her neck.

336
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,600
Snake in the grass.

337
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,500
I had a snake once.

338
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,640
But it swallowed the rabbit.
Had to chop it up - quite good fun!

339
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,500
Do you still paint, Michael,
like you used to?

340
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
Sold out, Sally.

341
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,560
30 pieces of silver.

342
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,560
Everyone has to earn a living, what?

343
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,740
In Parliament, Jim?
That's not really an honest living,
now, is it?

344
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,560
What?
Waste of time, Parliament.

345
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,640
Don't be such a rotten old sulk!

346
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,500
Alec has a point. What do you think,
Mrs Oliver?

347
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,540
Should all politicians be
eliminated?

348
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Eliminated?

349
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,600
I don't know.

350
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,520
They make ever such good suspects,
as a rule.

351
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,560
They certainly do.
I mean, just look at my husband.

352
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,660
You couldn't get more shifty
if you tried.

353
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,720
Excuse me, I'm going to bed.
Hattie?

354
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,700
I feel strange.
Darling? Darling, we're at dinner!

355
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,500
Oh, Lady Stubbs has gone early to
bed.

356
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,540
Malheureusement, oui.

357
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,520
She suffers, perhaps,
from the mental confusion?

358
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,580
Oh, no.

359
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
She knows exactly what she's doing.

360
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,620
What do you think?

361
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,740
I think, madame, that I take the
little walk.

362
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,600
Monsieur?

363
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,600
Do you want the ferry, sir?

364
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,560
Oh, non. Non, merci.

365
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,740
I stay at Nasse.

366
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,600
Oh.

367
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
'Tis up at Nasse, you are?
Oui.

368
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,580
I worked for the Folliats
many a year.

369
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,560
None them left now, of course,
except old Mum at up the lodge.

370
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,560
Met her, have 'ee?

371
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,560
Madame Folliat? Oui.

372
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,500
Bad luck, her's had.

373
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,660
Trouble with her husband,
trouble with her sons.

374
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,680
They were all right when they was
boys, always down here crabbing.

375
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
But when they grows up... pah!

376
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,520
Master Henry, he died for his
country, fair dos.

377
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,520
But Master James?

378
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
He was wild!

379
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,720
One of they as couldn't go straight.

380
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
By, he was vexing, Master James!

381
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Aeroplanes, flying.

382
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
That's no way to die.
No.

383
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
No, indeed.

384
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,700
What is your opinion of Sir George?
Pardon, Monsieur...?

385
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
John Murdle.

386
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,600
..Monsieur Merdell?

387
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Oh, non. Non, merci.

388
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,580
Gentleman be powerful rich,
wife's a fine lady from London.

389
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,620
Yeah, I remember the night they
arrived.

390
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Worst gale we ever had.

391
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,720
Big tree down in the woods made a
rare mess.

392
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,680
Where the folly it now stands?
Ah.

393
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Damn silly place for it too.

394
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,600
Never happened in t'Squire's day,
London nonsense.

395
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,560
It is sad, is it not,
that the time for the Folliat family,
it is finished?

396
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Always be Folliats at Nasse.

397
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,600
Monsieur?

398
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,560
Old Mum still be here, b'aint she?

399
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,560
Good night, sir.

400
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Bonne nuit.

401
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
Now...

402
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,680
here are some new ideas for the
pagoda.

403
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,560
What do you think?

404
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
See?

405
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
Ohh.

406
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,560
Oh, no.
What is it, darling?

407
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,620
It's from my cousin Etienne,
he's coming here.
He's coming in his yacht!

408
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Oh, no!

409
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Oh, may I see?

410
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
Who is this Etienne De Souza?

411
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,720
A distant cousin.

412
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,720
He says he's coming here today!

413
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,740
Pity he's dropping by
on the afternoon of the fete
but we'll make him welcome.

414
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,680
No, we can't! I need to lie down!
We can.

415
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,740
I have a headache!
Hattie, dear...

416
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Take some aspirin
and then it will go away.

417
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,660
Shall I bring you some?
No!

418
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Sweetheart... Excuse me.

419
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,680
Hattie, darling...
I don't want to see Etienne!

420
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,740
I don't like him, he's wicked,
he does foreign things!

421
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,560
No, Rogers, put the urn on the left!

422
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,560
Righto, ma'am.
The left!

423
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,720
Oh, the left?

424
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,720
Oh.

425
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Hello, Poirot.

426
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,740
Bonjour, madame.
What a beautiful day!

427
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,540
Yes.

428
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,540
And isn't it nice to have Nasse
lived in again?

429
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,680
We were all so afraid it would
become an hotel.

430
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,680
So many houses have.

431
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,720
"AA: three stars",
and what have you.

432
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,620
Ghastly.

433
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,660
I must say, George Stubbs
has done wonders for the place.

434
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,640
He's got good blood in him
somewhere.

435
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Father a gent and mother a barmaid,
that's my guess.

436
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,580
I see she got her way
with the fortuneteller's tent.

437
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,640
No, no, no!

438
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,680
No, you're trespassing!
You can't come through here,
do you understand?

439
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
The youth hostel is that way!

440
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,720
This is private land! Hop it!

441
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
This won't do!

442
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,540
Er...Poirot?

443
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Might I meet you in the study?

444
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,680
What's that, Hattie?
Yes, I'll shut it.

445
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,540
I put a padlock on the gate
but they come through the wood.

446
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,620
They don't understand a word I'm
talking about. They jabber on in
Dutch or French or whatever.

447
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,720
One of them was, I think, Italian.

448
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Precisely, yes, foreign.

449
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,640
Er...Poirot. Will you answer me a
question with the benefit of all
your experience?

450
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,700
Most certainly, monsieur, I will try.

451
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,680
Is Michael Weyman after my wife?

452
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,680
Monsieur?

453
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Well, she's behaving damn oddly.

454
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,560
All these headaches
and this constant lying down.

455
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,540
Every time I look at her,
there's Michael bloody Weyman
hovering nearby.

456
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,740
Sorry, I'm just being...pathetic.
But...

457
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,520
If you should see her getting up to
anything,

458
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,540
I mean, anything at all...

459
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
..you will let me know?

460
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
You look ridiculous.

461
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,480
Everybody, this way.

462
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Come along. Gather round, please.

463
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,560
Now, I declare the garden fete open.

464
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,740
Bravo!

465
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Madame, let us separate.

466
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
We shall watch with the peeled eye.

467
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,520
Mr and Mrs Hopper!

468
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,500
This is just like old times!

469
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,560
Isn't it the greatest success?
I've restocked with floribundas.

470
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,620
Just one small bomb would do it.

471
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
What about you, ladies?
Would you like to have a go?

472
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,500
Here, sir! It's for charity, sir.

473
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Children's fancy dress!

474
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,680
Form up, please.

475
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,620
You've won! Well done.
Congratulations, sir.

476
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Here's the first clue.

477
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,480
It's a photograph.

478
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,700
Work out what it is
and you'll get the second clue.

479
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,640
Good luck.

480
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
I see you're enjoying yourself.

481
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It is most horrible, is it not?

482
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new champion!

483
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,620
Little girl?
Un petit cadeau pour toi, hein?

484
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,740
Thank you.

485
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,520
Anything?

486
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,560
Non.

487
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,680
As far as I can tell,
they're just enjoying themselves,
which is a little galling.

488
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,680
How are you?
Good to see you.

489
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,660
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
You come also to the fete?

490
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,520
It is so fun!

491
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,520
My friend comes later
and then we go by bus to Torquay.

492
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,720
You remember my friend?
Oui, I saw her this morning.

493
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
Yes, the man was rude.

494
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,740
Now he is polite.

495
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,600
Mademoiselle Brewis.

496
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,700
Someone's made a speedy recovery.

497
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,560
Look, some ice cream!

498
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Madame.

499
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,560
That which you wear on your head,
it is a creation most beautiful.

500
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,640
Like something from the Royal Ascot,
n'estce pas?

501
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,620
You will make a long journey.

502
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,640
Possibly by train.

503
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
I see a luxurious train.

504
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,580
And great riches will be yours
at the end of your quest.

505
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,520
Madame Oliver told to me that
originally you were to be the victim.

506
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,540
But that you had been snatched from
her by the occult.

507
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,640
I wish I was the body.

508
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,640
Ah, this is exhausting!

509
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,560
Is it four o'clock yet?

510
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,720
I want my tea.

511
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,720
What do you think?

512
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,700
Je crois que vous avez raison.
There is something that is
uncomfortable.

513
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,560
And a murder hunt would be awfully
convenient if you wanted to conceal
a murder.

514
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,640
But a murder, madame, requires
a victim. So who is this victim?

515
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,640
This is what we must discover.

516
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,600
I say, seen Lady Stubbs?

517
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,480
She's meant to be judging the
fancy dress. Non.

518
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,660
What's the woman playing at?
I'll have to get someone else.

519
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,660
Has anyone seen Lady Stubbs?

520
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,620
Sally.

521
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Thank you.

522
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Excuse me!

523
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,600
Is this the house of
Sir George Stubbs?

524
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,680
Oui, d'accord.

525
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
I am Etienne De Souza.

526
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Enchante, monsieur.

527
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
I am Hercule Poirot.

528
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,600
De Souza, is it?

529
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
George Stubbs.
Good day to you.

530
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,680
A jolly busy one, actually.
Welcome to Nasse.

531
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,540
And delighted...
delighted to meet you.

532
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,600
My cousin Hattie is here?
Yes.

533
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,600
Yes, she is.

534
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,740
You will dine with us this evening,
I hope? Can we put you up?

535
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,660
I will sleep on my yacht,
The Esperance.

536
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Now, where the devil is my wife?

537
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,660
You hang on here
and I'll be straight back.

538
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,520
So it is some time
since last you saw your cousin?

539
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,560
I have not seen her since she was
14 years old.

540
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,600
Ah.

541
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,660
Then her parents suddenly died
and she was sent abroad.

542
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,520
As a child,
she promised to have good looks.

543
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,680
She is a woman most beautiful,
monsieur.

544
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,680
And...that is her husband?

545
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,540
Oui.

546
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Have you seen Lady Stubbs?
Have you seen my wife, Lady Stubbs?

547
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,680
Has anyone seen Lady Stubbs?

548
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,540
You haven't seen Lady Stubbs,
have you? Big hat and sunglasses?

549
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,580
She seems to have completely
disappeared.

550
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I feel certain that someone
is going to die.

551
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,640
Lady Stubbs? No?

552
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,640
I saw her last over there.

553
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,540
The world is a wicked place,
Monsieur Poirot.

554
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,720
Have you seen Lady Stubbs? Hattie?

555
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Have you seen Lady Stubbs?

556
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,680
Lady Stubbs, you haven't seen her?
We don't know where she is.

557
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,680
Lady Stubbs, she has disappeared.
They look everywhere. She is gone.
Where can she be?

558
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,680
Did anyone think of the boathouse?

559
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,580
Bon.

560
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,740
It's locked, to make sure
nobody finds the body by accident.

561
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Rather brilliant, don't you think?

562
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,520
Marlene, it's Mrs Oliver.
I'm coming in.

563
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,700
Marlene, you can get up.
It's only me.

564
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,740
Marlene?

565
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,540
Marlene?

566
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,680
That which you have feared
has happened, madame.

567
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Elle est morte.

568
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,660
You don't mean...

569
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,520
You don't mean... Oh!

570
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,720
Marlene!

571
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Marlene Tucker, local girl.

572
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,120
Lift, I got it.

573
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Garrotted with a length of rope.

574
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
The doctor says she's still warm.

575
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,080
Dead no more than an hour.

576
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,300
So the killer isn't far away?

577
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,140
I daresay. But who'd want to murder
a 14-year-old child?

578
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,160
"Johnny goes with Kate.

579
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,220
Georgie pinchers hikers in the
wood."

580
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Sir George Stubbs.

581
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,160
I'll need a room, sir.
And I'll want to question both
yourself and Lady Stubbs.

582
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,240
Yes, of course, but my wife seems
to have disappeared from view.

583
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,140
I'll find her eventually,
but I doubt she'll be much help.

584
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,160
I feel awful.

585
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,140
Put that in capital letters. Awful!

586
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,320
Because, you see, it's my murder.

587
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,200
I organised it.

588
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,160
I don't usually drink but Poirot
gave me this for the shock.

589
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,300
Did you say Poirot?

590
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,340
I don't suppose you remember me,
Monsieur Poirot.

591
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,080
Most assuredly.

592
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,120
It is the young Sergeant Bland,
whom I met...

593
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,140
it is now since 14, 15 years.

594
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,300
In...Gloucestershire.

595
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,220
What a memory.

596
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I cannot for the life of me remember
why I should have wanted

597
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,120
the Yugoslavian wife of a biochemist
to be the victim.

598
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,160
And I wasn't expecting a man in a
yacht.

599
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
What man in a yacht?

600
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,280
He sent a letter to Lady Stubbs
and she was frightened.

601
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,100
Frightened of what?
Frightened of him.

602
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
And now she's disappeared.

603
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,320
Can you tell me anything
about a man and a yacht?

604
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Oui, bien sur. Etienne De Souza.

605
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
The cousin of Lady Stubbs.

606
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,220
Who was afraid of this Etienne
De Souza. Do you know why?

607
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,320
I heard her say he was a bad man.

608
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,280
Oh. Do you think her fear was real?

609
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,140
If it was not,
she is an actress very clever.

610
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,340
You came ashore in a launch
at Nassecombe Quay.

611
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,260
Did you see a small wooden boathouse
on your way?

612
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,300
Yes, and had I known it belonged to
Nasse House, I should have come
ashore there,

613
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,180
but I didn't.

614
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,160
Did you see any signs of activity?

615
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,280
In the boathouse?

616
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,180
No.

617
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,240
Originally, the part of the victim
was to have been played by
Sally Legge.

618
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,340
But one evening, Sally told all our
fortunes and she was thought to be
strikingly good at it.

619
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,120
Someone suggested one of the Girl
Guides could be the corpse instead,

620
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
so Sally became Madam Zuleika.

621
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,280
Was Marlene Tucker happy to be the
victim?

622
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,120
Oh, she was thrilled.

623
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,280
I noticed a plate and a glass.

624
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,160
Yes, she had some jam tarts
and a fruit drink.

625
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,140
I took the tray down myself,
Lady Stubbs asked me to.

626
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
What time, exactly?

627
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,300
Oh, let's see...I'd say about
quarter past four.

628
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,160
Where were you between a quarter
past four and five o'clock?

629
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
How do you pin it down so exactly?

630
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Miss Brewer saw Marlene at 4.15.

631
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,280
Lady Stubbs asked her to take down
some food and drink to the
boathouse.

632
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,100
Lady Stubbs asked her?
Hardly think so.

633
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,260
Lady Stubbs's mind revolves
entirely around herself.

634
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,300
Marlene could die of malnutrition
for all she'd care.

635
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,200
At a quarter past four,
Marlene Tucker was alive and well?

636
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,280
Oh, yes. I called out and she opened
the door. She was fine.

637
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,300
Moronic, but fine.

638
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
Do you enjoy working for Sir George?

639
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
I can't imagine doing anything else.

640
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,200
You listen here, Bland.

641
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,160
You've simply got to do something.

642
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,200
My wife has been missing for two
hours!

643
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,320
I am going half mad with worry.

644
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,080
I've got men looking into it.
We do have a murder to deal with,
sir.

645
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,320
Let's hope it's not two, then!

646
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,240
This is a murder investigation,
so would you answer my question,
please, sir?

647
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
Where were you this afternoon?

648
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,140
I went to the pub across the river.

649
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,140
Working for these lunatics
has driven me to drink.

650
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,140
How well do you know your cousin?
My second cousin.

651
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,200
I don't know her well.

652
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,080
Yet you just thought you'd pay her
a surprise visit?

653
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,260
Hardly a surprise visit, Inspector.

654
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,220
I wrote to her three weeks ago from
St Malo.

655
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,200
I said I hoped to arrive in Nascombe
around about today.

656
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,240
It is hard to be specific on a
sailboat.

657
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,220
Did she reply?

658
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
To be frank with you, gentlemen,

659
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,100
I don't think Cousin Hattie
has the mental capacity for writing
letters.

660
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,320
Though I understand she has grown
into a lovely woman.

661
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,300
Haven't you seen her?
No, I have not.

662
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,280
Where is she?

663
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,220
She's probably just gone for a walk.
She's a grown woman.

664
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,200
Rather a helpless one,
by all accounts. Yes.

665
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
When she wants to be.

666
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,160
Tell me everything you know
about Lady Stubbs.

667
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
How would you describe her?

668
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,320
I'd describe her as...ornamental.

669
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,180
Like a trefoil or a crocket,
pretty, but...

670
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,240
..useless.

671
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Backward?
"Backward"?

672
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,200
No. Cunning little minx.

673
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,120
She didn't leave by boat.

674
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,080
The road was closed. I reckon she's
still on the property somewhere.

675
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,340
Why? Nothing to stop her hopping
across the fence and making off
across country.

676
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,220
Madam was wearing
"a biascut chiffon dress,

677
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,140
with double rouleau
straps"...whatever that is,

678
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,280
"..a large red hat
and shoes with three-inch heels."

679
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,120
I don't think she'll be doing no
crosscountry run.

680
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,120
She could have changed her clothes.

681
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,120
Her maid says nothing's missing.

682
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,280
No suitcase packed.

683
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,140
Nothing.

684
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Lady Stubbs?

685
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Lady Stubbs?
Lady Stubbs?

686
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,080
Hoskins, stand the men down.

687
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Uh-huh, very well, sir.

688
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Inspector Bland.

689
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Poirot, he should have prevented
the murder of Marlene Tucker.

690
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,280
The least he can do is to find the
killer.

691
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,300
Si vous permettez,
I would like to help.

692
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,240
Anything?
Er...no, sir.

693
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,280
I'm sorry.

694
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,300
Sir George, there is something
I should like to ask you.

695
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,280
Did your wife receive a letter
from Mr De Souza three weeks ago,

696
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,280
saying he was coming to this
country?

697
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,100
No, we only heard the man was
arriving this morning.

698
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,180
Well, why did she dread seeing him
so much?

699
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,300
Blessed if I know.
Monsieur.

700
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,160
Exactly what did she say?

701
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,160
She said...

702
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,180
he kills people.

703
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,140
Well, she couldn't actually say who
De Souza was supposed to have killed
or where or why.

704
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,160
But don't tell me he arrives off his
yacht and immediately strangles a
girl in my boathouse.

705
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,240
The door to the boathouse,
it has the Yale lock, oui?

706
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,260
So no one may enter without a key.

707
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,200
So if you permit me to ask,
there are how many keys?

708
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,200
Well, three.

709
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,120
One was a clue in a murder hunt,
concealed in foliage at the top of
the garden.

710
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,160
The second key
was in the possession of Mrs Oliver.
Where's the third key?

711
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
It's here.

712
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,260
Where...

713
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,300
..it always is.

714
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,300
Do you see what that means?

715
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,240
The only people who could
have got into the boathouse,

716
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,240
were, firstly, whoever completed
the murder hunt and found the key

717
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,240
which didn't happen,

718
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,320
secondly, Mrs Oliver or someone
to whom she gave her key

719
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,320
which she says didn't happen
and Poirot was with her.

720
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,180
Or thirdly, someone whom Marlene
herself admitted to the room.

721
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,100
But that could be anyone out
of 200 or 300 people, couldn't it?

722
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,160
No, Sir George, because when the girl
heard someone to approach,

723
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,240
she was to lie down and pretend to be
dead.

724
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,300
She was to be discovered by the
person who had found the final clue -
the key.

725
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,320
The only other people she could have
admitted when they called to her from
outside

726
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,080
were those people who had organised
this murder hunt.

727
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,120
Yourself, Lady Stubbs, Miss Brewis,
Mrs Oliver...

728
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,160
Who else did Marlene know,
Sir George?

729
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
Ah, right, erm...

730
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Alec and Sally Legge...

731
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,140
Michael Weyman...

732
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,200
..the Warburtons...

733
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,340
oh, and er...Mrs Folliat.

734
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,220
Sorry.

735
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,100
It is as you said to me yesterday,
madame.

736
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,260
A world that is very wicked.

737
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Well, it's true.

738
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,100
This morning Lady Stubbs,
she also spoke of wickedness.

739
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,220
I shouldn't pay too much attention
to the things Hattie says.

740
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,120
So everyone tells to me.

741
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,300
She has always had the mental age of
a child.

742
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,280
As you know, madame, such people
are not always accountable for their
actions.

743
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,300
In a fit of rage...

744
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
..they might even kill.
No!

745
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,180
Hattie was a gentle,
warm-hearted girl.

746
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,320
She would never have killed anyone.
Never.

747
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,340
Then can you think who might have
killed Marlene Tucker?

748
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,140
No, I can't.

749
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,240
What can you tell me about the
local people?

750
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,240
Captain Warburton? He was working
hard at the fete all afternoon.

751
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,280
Mrs Warburton?

752
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,280
Enid Warburton runs the Girl Guides
and the gymkhana.

753
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,240
She's clearly beyond reproach.

754
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,160
And the Legges?
What do you know about them?

755
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,260
They're just holidaying here.

756
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,200
Madame Legge, she's a lady most
attractive, n'estce pas?

757
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
Vivacious.
Oui.

758
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,240
Is it possible, do you think,
that Sir George Stubbs felt the
attractions to Madame Legge?

759
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,160
Good heavens, no. Sir George is
extremely fond of his wife.

760
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,240
Was it you or Lady Stubbs

761
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,280
who asked Miss Brewis to take jam
tarts down to the girl in the
boathouse?

762
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,160
Goodness. All these questions.

763
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,240
I remember Miss Brewis collecting
some cakes but I don't recall that
anyone asked her to do so.

764
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,320
You were serving in the tea tent
between four and five o'clock.

765
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,320
I believe Mrs Legge came in there at
that time for her tea?

766
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,340
No, she didn't.

767
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,340
She was dressed as Madame Zuleika,
remember?

768
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,180
She never set foot in the tea tent.

769
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Sorry it's so late, Mrs Legge.

770
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,260
Please, tell me when you last saw
Lady Stubbs.

771
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,300
I think when I came out of my tent
to go and have tea.

772
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
I remember her hat.

773
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,180
Massive, wasn't it?

774
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,280
When did you take your tea?

775
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,140
Four o'clock.

776
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,340
In the tea tent?

777
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,140
Was it crowded?

778
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,200
Yes, awfully.

779
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
A coach party from Torquay.

780
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,340
Did you see anyone you knew there?

781
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Not a soul.

782
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,440
Good morning, sir.
Bonjour.

783
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,320
Is there any sign of Lady Stubbs?

784
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,460
No, I do not believe so.

785
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,380
Oh, Monsieur Henden,
tell to me if you please,

786
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,460
for how long a time
have you been here the butler?

787
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,380
Just over a 12-month, sir.

788
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,360
Bon.

789
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,380
Merci.

790
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,320
It's an invitation from the
Lord Lieutenant of the county.

791
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Mademoiselle.

792
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,500
And Hodgson's written about the
state of the milking sheds.

793
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,400
Damn the milking sheds to hell!

794
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,420
Where is my wife?

795
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,540
Women don't just disappear, do they?

796
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Utter, utter fool!

797
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,320
What on earth possessed him to marry
her?

798
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,460
Eh bien, it has been a marriage
unfortunate.

799
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,360
Disastrous.

800
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
All she ever does is spend his
money.

801
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,500
Why, this year alone she's bought
two minx and a Russian ermine.

802
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
He's such a...

803
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,340
He's such an innocent.

804
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,520
And she's a sly,
scheming clever cat.

805
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,340
You say "is" and not "was".

806
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,320
She isn't dead.

807
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,340
She's gone off with another man.

808
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,520
She likes men.

809
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,540
She's already made a fool of
Michael Weyman.

810
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,480
But Monsieur Weyman,
he designs her tennis court.

811
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,320
Tennis! She wouldn't know
a double fault from a fruit cake.

812
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,300
Weyman tried it on.
She gave him the heave-ho
because she's found someone else,

813
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,360
so he has too.

814
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,540
If Monsieur Weyman
no longer pursues Lady Stubbs,

815
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,460
what is it about her
that makes you so suspicious of her?

816
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,500
She meets someone on the sly,
Poirot.

817
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,460
She slips out of the house and into
the woods.

818
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,400
She was out the night before last.

819
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,520
All the yawning
and saying she's too tired for
dinner...

820
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,360
Half an hour later
she slips out by the kitchen door.

821
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,380
She's an alley cat, Hattie Stubbs.

822
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,300
It's an unpleasant thing to have to
face.

823
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,400
But I'd say we've some kind of
psychological lunatic wandering
freely in Devon.

824
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,300
He won't be local.

825
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,340
Somerset, perhaps.

826
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,360
Peutetre.

827
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Therefore a question, if you please.

828
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,480
How is it possible for a strange man
to have gained access into the
boathouse?

829
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,440
Easy.

830
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,420
She came out.

831
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,480
She got bored.

832
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
Girls do. Trust me.

833
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,540
The most likely thing is that
Marlene saw Hattie Stubbs being
murdered,

834
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,400
so she had to be disposed of too.

835
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,400
Crush her windpipe, drag her back
inside, flick the Yale. Easy.

836
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,460
Oui. Sir George Stubbs believes that
his wife she is still alive.

837
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,420
Men will believe anything.

838
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,480
Look, I like George Stubbs.

839
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,360
He and his wife have done wonders
for Nasse.

840
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,480
Amy Folliat has sponsored them,
of course.

841
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
And she has influence in the county.

842
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,420
Why, there have been Folliats here
since Tudor times.

843
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,460
"Always been Folliats at Nasse".

844
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,300
Oh, Marlene, Marlene.

845
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Alors, she spies.

846
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,320
Oui.

847
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,340
She looks and she learns.

848
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,380
But something it is not...en point.

849
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,460
Poirot.

850
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,460
Your brain, it is so slow.

851
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,420
They've found something.

852
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,300
Is it hers?

853
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,520
Let me see.

854
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,360
Christ, it's her hat.

855
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,360
Where is she? Where's my wife?
I don't think we'll find her here.

856
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,400
I'll tell you where you will find
her, where you're too bloody stupid
to have looked.

857
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,480
And where's that, sir?

858
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,380
On that fellow's... that fellow's
yacht, Etienne De Souza.

859
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,380
Damn coincidence, isn't it? I mean,
he turns up and all bloody hell
breaks loose.

860
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,500
I've got a warrant to search your
vessel.

861
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,480
Do you think I'm hiding my little
cousin on board?

862
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,320
I don't think anything, sir.
Rather as I suspected.

863
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,460
You have lost something, madame?

864
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,360
Oh, you made me jump.

865
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,460
Yes, I have.

866
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,460
Or must one rendezvous when one can?

867
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,320
I don't know what you mean.

868
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,460
Ah.

869
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,540
Poirot is not a husband, alas,

870
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,540
but...he knows that they can be
jealous.

871
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,340
I doubt mine is.

872
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,420
I hoped, when I came down here,
that everything would get better.

873
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,340
But it hasn't.

874
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,460
Alec's just...

875
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
Well...

876
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,540
He's still Alec.

877
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,460
I don't want to live like this.

878
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,320
Non.

879
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,380
Have a look here, sir.

880
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,360
Got something?
Yes, sir.

881
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,340
This is the jacket
the gentleman was wearing yesterday.

882
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,380
And look what I found in the pocket.

883
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,480
What is it?

884
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,320
It is the ring worn by Lady Stubbs
at the time of her disappearance.

885
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,460
It matches Sir George's description.

886
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,320
How do you come to have this,
Mr De Souza?

887
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,340
I have no idea.

888
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,440
I've never seen it before.

889
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,360
Maybe you have, maybe you haven't,
but it's grounds enough for me to
arrest you.

890
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,360
For what, may I ask?
For being foreign?

891
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,300
For the murder of Harriet Stubbs.

892
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,320
For the...

893
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,460
You have no proof at all.

894
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,340
This is meant to be a civilised
country.

895
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,380
We like to think so, sir.

896
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,340
Hoskins.

897
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,320
Is this what you were looking for,
madame?

898
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,340
Oh, yes.

899
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,320
Thank you, Monsieur Poirot.

900
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,420
I must have dropped it.
Oui.

901
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,480
We've got him, Poirot.

902
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,420
Her ring is in the pocket of his
blazer.

903
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,520
That and all the hearsay evidence,
I reckon I can get a conviction.

904
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,420
For the murder of Lady Stubbs,
whose body has never been found?

905
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,480
Well, it was dumped in the river.
It floated out to sea.

906
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
It'll turn up in time.

907
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,340
No, I'm sure she was killed here at
Nasse.

908
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,360
I closed the roads, put a man at
the quay, checked all the buses
and trains.

909
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,380
There was never a sign of her.

910
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,460
No, she was dumped in the river
near where we found her hat.

911
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,360
And Marlene Tucker saw it happening.

912
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,480
So, probably,
De Souza fixed her too.

913
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
No. It is not Etienne De Souza.

914
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,520
Why not?

915
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,360
How did he know where to find her
when his boat, it had only just
arrived?

916
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,320
Non.

917
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,340
It does not make any sense.

918
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,500
Bonjour, Monsieur Merdell.

919
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,360
Do 'ee want the ferry, sir?

920
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,340
Non, merci. I return today to London.

921
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,460
Poor fella.

922
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,480
Why must 'ee do that?

923
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,380
Because Poirot, he has failed.

924
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,460
Because...

925
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,440
Poirot is an imbecile.

926
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,520
Did Hattie Stubbs ask
Mademoiselle Brewis

927
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,540
to take the jam tarts to
Marlene Tucker in the boathouse?

928
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,540
If not, why does she say that
she did?

929
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,540
Is it possible that Mademoiselle
Brewis found Marlene Tucker already
dead?

930
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,380
In which case,
why does she not report this?

931
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,440
She is a woman most sensible.
Unless she killed her, of course.

932
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,460
Non. Pas de motive.

933
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,340
Why did Etienne De Souza
lie about writing to his cousin

934
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,340
three weeks before his arrival at
Nasse House?

935
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:01,340
Is it perhaps an attempt to make his
visit appear natural or expected?

936
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,460
Certainement,
Sir George receives him amicably.

937
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,540
Although he does not know him.

938
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,380
Attendez.

939
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,460
Sir George does not know
Etienne De Souza, oui?

940
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,320
But his wife who does know him
does not see him.

941
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,340
So is it conceivable...

942
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,380
that the Etienne De Souza who arrives
at the fete is not the real Etienne
De Souza?

943
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,360
When is his trial?

944
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,420
In three weeks.

945
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,320
The jury will take one look at
De Souza and they will convict him.

946
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,340
This man will hang.

947
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,520
Usually the villain's the husband.

948
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,320
Oui. Je sais.

949
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
This husband, he has the alibi.

950
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,460
There are 200 people willing to
testify that Sir George never left
the fete.

951
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,480
But there is someone...someone
who knows what happened to
Hattie Stubbs.

952
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,340
Do you think the body's still there?

953
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,320
It appears that she has been thrown
into the river.

954
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,500
But it is possible that
she is in the grounds.

955
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,520
There isn't a priest's hole or
anything like that, is there?

956
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,540
No, I asked this question to
Monsieur Weyman.

957
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,380
He tells to me that the house
is not of the correct period for
this.

958
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,540
All the same,
there might be something...

959
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,400
..in the structure
that only the family know about.

960
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,400
But the only member of the family
who is left is Madame Folliat.

961
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,340
Well, she knows everything there is
to know about Nasse, doesn't she?

962
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,380
It is a true thing that you say.

963
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,400
She knows everything.

964
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,500
Par exemple, she knows straight away
that Hattie Stubbs is dead.

965
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,520
She knows even before
the death of Marlene Tucker

966
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,420
that the world it is a place most
wicked.

967
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,300
What is there that she does not know?

968
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,460
Monsieur Legge...

969
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,460
You are leaving Nasse House?

970
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,420
Yes.

971
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,400
Sally's cleared out.
Non.

972
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,420
With that bastard Weyman.

973
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,480
I do not think she will be as happy
with him as she would be with you.

974
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,340
You think so, do you?
Yes, I do, Monsieur.

975
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,520
And shall I tell you what else
I think?

976
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,540
I think that your opinions so extreme
have made you impossible to live
with!

977
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,520
Your wife, Sally Legge,
she is a woman of loyalty,

978
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,400
but you have pushed her too hard,
monsieur.

979
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:07,420
You are a man who is very lonely,
very desperate,

980
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,480
and if you had told your wife, Madame
Sally, just how you are so lonely

981
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,400
and how you are so desperate,

982
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,360
she would never have left you
for Michael Weyman.

983
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,480
You don't know how right you are.
Oui.

984
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,440
I've been an absolute dummy.
Oui.

985
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,420
It's politics, eh, Poirot?

986
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,440
It's hardly worth losing your wife
for.

987
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,440
Non, I do not think they are,
monsieur.

988
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,480
Non.

989
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,540
What shall I do?

990
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,440
I think what you should do, monsieur,
is to find Madame Sally immediately.

991
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,480
Ask her to forgive you
and beg her to come back.

992
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,440
And Hercule Poirot,
he is always right, monsieur.

993
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,340
Do you know, I think I will.
Bon.

994
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,400
And I'll go to the bloody Chelsea
Arts Club and I'll get hold of
Michael Weyman

995
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,480
and I'll throttle the ponce with
his ridiculous tie. Bon.

996
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500
And if you please, Monsieur Legge,

997
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,480
do not actually kill him, hein.

998
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,500
Bonjour, madame.

999
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,340
I feel very sorry for George.
The strain's been very great.

1000
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,460
So Sir George still believes that
his wife, she is alive?

1001
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,300
I think he's given up hope.

1002
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,380
He does not say so but...

1003
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,340
Of course,
I've hardly seen him lately.

1004
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,420
Spends most of his time in London.

1005
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,540
He's drinking too much.

1006
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,420
I am very tired, Monsieur Poirot.

1007
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,420
I have not much to live for.

1008
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
But you have your home.

1009
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,360
Monsieur, I am grateful to George
Stubbs for renting me the lodge

1010
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,440
but I do rent it.
I pay him a yearly sum for it

1011
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,460
with a right to walk in the grounds.

1012
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,520
The grounds of my ancestral home.
Oh, je suis desole.

1013
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,400
Madame, I do not mean to offend.

1014
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,380
I mean only to say
that this is a place so beautiful.

1015
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,360
It is in fact one of the most
beautiful places
I have seen in England.

1016
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:28,360
It has about it the great peace
and the great serenity.

1017
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,360
Yes.

1018
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,380
But is there still the same peace
and serenity now, madame?

1019
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,440
Why shouldn't there be?

1020
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,300
Because a murder,
it has gone unavenged and blood,
it has been spilled.

1021
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,480
And here is the smell of it,
the reek of it, drifting across
the lawn on the breeze.

1022
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,280
I think that is quite enough.
Madame...

1023
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,500
Until the curse is lifted,
there will be no peace at Nasse.
You know this is true.

1024
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,420
You know a great deal, perhaps
everything, about the murder.

1025
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
You know who killed the girl.
You know why.

1026
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:58,500
You know who killed Hattie Stubbs and
you know perhaps where the body it
now lies.

1027
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,460
I have only my suspicions.

1028
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,420
And to speak out on mere suspicion
would be wrong.

1029
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,440
Wicked.

1030
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,360
As wicked as what was done here,
it is not since five weeks.

1031
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,360
As wicked as the killing of the girl
who was only 14 years of age.

1032
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,440
Don't talk about it.
It's over and done. It's finished.

1033
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,380
No, madame.
It is never finished with a murder.

1034
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,540
Jamais.

1035
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,420
Mademoiselle,
where is Monsieur Merdell?

1036
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,460
Grandad?

1037
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,340
He's dead.

1038
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,420
Grandad?

1039
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,440
So Monsieur Merdell was your
grandfather?

1040
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,300
Your grandfather, he was very old.

1041
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,320
He didn't die cos he was old.

1042
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,340
He died cos he was drunk.

1043
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,400
He slipped when getting off the boat
one night and fell in.

1044
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:52,400
Washed up two days later at
Helmouth.

1045
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,500
And how do you call yourself?

1046
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,520
Gertie Tucker.

1047
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,520
A relation to Marlene Tucker?

1048
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,540
Her was my sister.

1049
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,380
So Monsieur Merdell was her
grandfather also.

1050
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,420
He got cross at her
when she got the makeup.

1051
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:10,480
The makeup, Gertie?
Loads of lipstick she had.

1052
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,340
And scent.
Hid 'em in her knicker drawer.

1053
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,380
Lovely, they was.

1054
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,380
Tell to me, Gertie, how did Marlene
get the money to buy these things?

1055
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,460
- Her see goings-on in the woods.
- (Gertie...)

1056
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,480
Marlene'll promise not to tell
and they give her money.

1057
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,340
- (Gertie...)
- But who would give her mon...

1058
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,300
At last, at last.

1059
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,300
Poirot, he begins to see.

1060
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,420
"Come at once.

1061
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,420
Nasse House, Devon."

1062
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,420
Mais pourquoi?

1063
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,440
Because it is important, madame.

1064
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,420
I should hope so.

1065
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,520
I was due to give a talk.
That's why I'm dressed in this
ridiculous outfit.

1066
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:07,520
Instead,
I ran for the Express train.

1067
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,540
What was the subject of your talk?

1068
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,480
My writing. Pleased not to have to
give it as a matter of fact.

1069
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,360
I mean, what does one say
about how one writes books?

1070
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,380
You just think of an idea
and force yourself to write it.

1071
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,340
What am I going to say
for the other 59 minutes?

1072
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,400
Madame, your hat...

1073
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,320
C'est magnifique.

1074
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,340
Oh, thank you.

1075
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,520
Jolly expensive.

1076
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,340
Hats are really a symbol nowadays,
aren't they?

1077
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,480
They don't keep your head warm
or shield you from the sun

1078
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,540
or hide your face from people
you don't want to meet.
I mean, they're just ornamental.

1079
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,340
Always you give to me the ideas.

1080
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:51,500
Tell to me, madame, in your murder
hunt you have as one of your suspects
a biochemist.

1081
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,440
Do you know a biochemist personally?

1082
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,280
Yes, I know Alec Legge.

1083
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,360
And you also know his wife Sally
Legge but she is not Yugoslavian,
is she?

1084
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:05,280
So what gives to you the idea of
having a wife who is Yugoslavian
for the victim?

1085
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,480
Oh, I don't know.
All those youth hostellers perhaps.

1086
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,460
All those girls in shorts.

1087
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,500
But, madame, I am most interested in
how you write.

1088
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,440
You are a woman who is most
sensitive.

1089
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:19,380
You are affected by the atmosphere,
by the personalities that surround
you.

1090
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:23,440
These are the inspirations for
your brain that is so fertile.

1091
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,460
So tell to me, madame, when you first
designed your murder hunt,

1092
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,440
did you intend for the body
to be discovered in the boathouse?

1093
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
No, I did not.
Ah.

1094
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,320
I intended it to be found in that
pavilion. Tucked away among the
rhododendrons.

1095
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,320
But then someone...

1096
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,480
I can't remember who.

1097
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,440
..began insisting it should be found
in the folly.

1098
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,500
Well, that was obviously bonkers.

1099
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,280
I mean, anyone could have strolled
in there quite casually.

1100
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,480
I couldn't agree to that.
Non.

1101
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,540
So you accepted the boathouse
instead.

1102
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,520
And that was the technique
that you described to me on that
first day.

1103
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,360
The jockeying along.

1104
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,440
One last thing, madame.

1105
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,520
Do you remember telling me
that there was a final clue

1106
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,540
on one of the comics that was given
to Marlene Tucker to read?

1107
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:15,340
Was it something like
"Biddy Fox has a secret den"?

1108
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360
Good gracious me, no.

1109
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,320
Nothing silly like that.

1110
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,440
No, it was a perfectly
straightforward clue.

1111
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,460
"Look in the hiker's rucksack."

1112
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,480
Epatant.

1113
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,440
The comic on which that was written
would have to be taken away.

1114
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,440
Why?

1115
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,540
Because immediatement
it points to the murderer.

1116
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,380
Inspector Bland, you must telephone
to Scotland Yard tout de suite.

1117
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,300
Why? Because Etienne De Souza,
he is innocent.

1118
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,340
He is a man of great wealth.

1119
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,480
So what?
So...

1120
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
What is his motive?

1121
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,360
Let me put to you the facts.
Facts?

1122
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,440
What facts?

1123
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:56,380
The fact that old John Merdell
was the grandfather of Marlene
Tucker.

1124
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,360
The fact that Lady Stubbs always wore
those particular types of floppy hat.

1125
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:04,420
The fact that Marlene Tucker had
cosmetics hidden in the back of her
drawer

1126
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,500
and the fact that Mademoiselle Brewis

1127
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,320
maintains it was Lady Stubbs who
asked her to take refreshments to
the boathouse.

1128
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,400
You call those facts, do you,
in London?

1129
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,360
You prefer the hard evidence?

1130
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,380
Such as the body of Lady Stubbs?

1131
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,420
I know where it is hidden
and who hid it there.

1132
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,340
So, if you please to make that
telephone call to Scotland Yard.

1133
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,260
Why did you ask me to come here?

1134
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,300
I think that you know, madame.

1135
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,260
Good evening, sir.

1136
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,280
There have now been three murders.

1137
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,320
Hattie Stubbs.

1138
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,340
Marlene Tucker.

1139
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,160
And John Merdell.

1140
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,180
Merdell?

1141
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,180
That was an accident. He fell from
the quayside. He was drunk.

1142
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,220
No. No, it was not an accident,
madame.

1143
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,220
He knew too much.

1144
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,280
He knew all about the Folliat family.

1145
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:57,260
He knew about your husband.
He knew about your two sons
who died abroad.

1146
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,180
Only they did not, did they?

1147
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,220
Henry was indeed killed in action
on the Northwest frontier but
James...

1148
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,180
No, he did not die as you said.

1149
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:16,140
James...who was so brilliant,
so wild.

1150
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,300
James, who was also to you
so shaming.

1151
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,220
John Merdell told me of him, madame,
and the records have been checked.

1152
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,180
What did he do to that young dairy
maid when he was only, what,
14 years of age?

1153
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,180
You know?
Oui.

1154
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,180
And where did you send him, madame?

1155
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,100
South Africa.

1156
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,140
Oui.

1157
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,340
You said you never saw him again.

1158
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,200
You heard that he had died
in an aeroplane crash.

1159
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,340
You mourned, you said your prayers,
but...

1160
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,120
What then has happened, madame?

1161
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,320
He came back.
Oui.

1162
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,340
Because your son, he made the
pretence of his own death.

1163
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,260
And then you learned that he is
pursued by the police in several
countries.

1164
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,300
And you agree, and he must have been
so persuasive...

1165
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,340
You agree to give him one more
chance.

1166
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,220
Just one.
Oui.

1167
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,200
I believe that you are a woman most
sincere.

1168
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,240
And most moral.

1169
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:34,120
And I believe that it was from the
best of your intentions

1170
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,100
that you did everything you could
to give to your son, who was wayward,

1171
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,140
a new life.

1172
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,300
At that time you had in your charge
a young girl who was sadly subnormal.

1173
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,180
But she was rich.
So rich. She was worth a fortune.

1174
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:56,140
But you gave it out that her parents
had lost all their money.

1175
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,300
And you were advising her to marry
a man who was wealthy and older than
herself.

1176
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,200
And who could disbelieve you?

1177
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,220
Your lawyers in Paris where
you were living at that time handled
everything.

1178
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,300
And Hattie Stubbs,
when she came of age...

1179
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,220
..would sign whatever you put in
front of her.

1180
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,180
And so in the end, Sir George Stubbs,

1181
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,220
the new identity assumed by your son
James,

1182
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,240
became a man who was very rich.

1183
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,180
Rich enough to buy Nasse House.

1184
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,260
And there your plans, they ended,
madame.

1185
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:40,120
Your son, he was a wealthy man.
He had his ancestral home.

1186
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,180
And Hattie Stubbs, well...

1187
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,140
You could take care of her.

1188
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,300
Ca marche.

1189
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,160
I never dreamed...

1190
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,340
No, you never dreamed that your son
James, he was already married.

1191
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,300
He was married to a girl he met in
Trieste.

1192
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,340
A girl of the criminal underworld

1193
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,180
who is determined
not to be parted from your son.

1194
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,200
She's a wicked, wicked creature.

1195
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:07,320
But your Hattie knew no-one in
England.

1196
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,100
Good evening, Hattie.

1197
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,100
Come along, my dear.

1198
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,140
When they arrived back at Nasse House
after their marriage,

1199
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,280
all of the servants,
who were new, including the butler,

1200
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,120
barely caught sight of her that first
evening.

1201
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,240
And the following morning, the woman
that they met was not Hattie Stubbs,
non, but this Italian

1202
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,300
made up to look like Hattie,
behaving as Hattie.

1203
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,140
But Hattie, the real Hattie,

1204
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
was dead.

1205
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,180
She was killed the first evening
she arrived here by your son.

1206
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,140
Oui. By your son, madame,
James Folliat.

1207
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,300
And this plan, it was so clever.

1208
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,220
The false Hattie Stubbs over the
years would respond to treatment.

1209
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,260
She would get better and better
and make a full recovery.

1210
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,120
But this Italian
did not convince Mademoiselle Brewis.

1211
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,140
I have a headache!

1212
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,200
Who was herself in love with
Sir George.

1213
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,220
But then something unforeseen occurs.

1214
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,220
A cousin of Hattie, Etienne De Souza,

1215
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,220
writes to her a telegram...

1216
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,200
Oh, no.

1217
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,120
..telling her he is visiting England
on a yachting trip.

1218
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,180
What is it, darling?

1219
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,120
Alors, he would not be deceived
by an imposter.

1220
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:34,280
It is strange, is it not,
that although the thought,
it did cross my mind

1221
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,180
that this Etienne De Souza
may not be Etienne De Souza,

1222
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:44,120
it never occurred to Poirot that
Hattie Stubbs was not Hattie Stubbs.

1223
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,100
And there was a further complication.

1224
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:53,100
John Merdell used to...

1225
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,120
What is the word?

1226
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,320
..chatter

1227
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,140
to his granddaughter Marlene Tucker.

1228
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,320
If someone leaves a woman's body
in the woods with no clothes on,

1229
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,240
he's liable to be a sex maniac,
isn't he?

1230
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,120
Well, nobody else would listen to him
because they thought he was a little
daft.

1231
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:19,240
But he told to his granddaughter
Marlene that Sir George was in fact
Master James.

1232
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:29,120
Alors, Marlene Tucker,
she blackmailed Sir George
for her silence.

1233
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,200
But in so doing,
she signs her death warrant.

1234
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:41,300
They arrange it so that Marlene
Tucker is killed and Hattie Stubbs
goes missing

1235
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:48,220
in such a way, the suspicion it is
thrown onto her cousin
Etienne De Souza.

1236
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,180
Hence the references
to him being a man most wicked.

1237
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,200
Delighted to meet you at last.

1238
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:58,260
And Sir George,
he plants the evidence.

1239
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:05,140
This Lady Stubbs
was to disappear permanently.

1240
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:10,260
After a period of mourning,
Sir George would rejoin her in Italy

1241
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,300
where they would again be married.

1242
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,240
All that was necessary for her now

1243
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:20,180
was to double the parts for
a little more than a period of, what,
24 hours.

1244
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:26,160
When Hercule Poirot, he arrives,
Hattie Stubbs takes the bus to
Exeter.

1245
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,200
Afternoon, ladies.

1246
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:32,160
And travelled back in the company of
a youth hosteller she meets on the
train.

1247
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,140
You don't mind, do you, sir?

1248
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,300
She books into the hostel with this
Dutch girl.

1249
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,100
But by teatime, she is here,
back at her window.

1250
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,200
After dinner she retires early to
bed.

1251
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,220
I feel strange.

1252
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,180
But Mademoiselle Brewis sees her
slip out of the back door.

1253
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,220
She spends the night in the youth
hostel,

1254
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,320
returns to Nasse for breakfast,

1255
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:09,160
after which she spends the rest of
the morning in her room with her
headache.

1256
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,300
She then stages her appearance...

1257
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,160
..as a trespasser.

1258
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,260
You can't come through here!

1259
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,320
Sir George shouts to her
from the window of his wife.

1260
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,080
What's that, Hattie?

1261
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,140
He turns and even pretends to speak
to her inside.

1262
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,180
But she is not there.

1263
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:35,220
No-one would ever dream that these
two women were the same person

1264
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,140
and no-one did.

1265
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:42,180
And so the final act of this drama,
it is staged.

1266
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:46,200
A little before four o'clock on the
day of the fete

1267
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,320
Hattie Stubbs tells to Mademoiselle
Brewis to take the jam tarts to
Marlene

1268
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,200
because she is afraid that
Mademoiselle Brewis may do this
independently

1269
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,140
and that would be fatal to their
plans.

1270
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:02,280
She slips into the tent of the
fortune teller while Sally Legge
is out.

1271
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:06,140
And she has a secret rendezvous
with Michael Weyman.

1272
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:12,280
She goes through the back into the
pavilion where she changes into the
costume of a hiker,

1273
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,340
which she kept in her rucksack.

1274
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,340
Poirot, he has found the buckle from
the strap.

1275
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,140
And that is why the pavilion,
it was not used for the murder.

1276
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,260
She then goes down to the boathouse,
calls to Marlene to let her in.

1277
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
And she strangles her.

1278
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,180
She leaves her big floppy hat by the
riverside

1279
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,300
and hastily joins her Dutch friend
on the lawn.

1280
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,300
A little before five,
they take the bus to Torquay.

1281
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,320
And a little after five, the police,
they arrive.

1282
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,120
Where she is now I do not know.

1283
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,260
But I am convinced that the police,
they will find her.

1284
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:17,200
Remember, madame, before they were
not looking for an Italian confidence
trickster. Non.

1285
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,260
They were looking for Hattie.

1286
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:24,140
Simple, subnormal.

1287
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,160
And dead.

1288
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,220
And this you have always known,
madame.

1289
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,200
You revealed your knowledge to me

1290
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:36,180
when you spoke to me in the dining
room on the evening of the fete.

1291
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,280
You revealed most clearly,
although Poirot he did not see it
at the time,

1292
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,260
that when speaking of
Hattie Stubbs...

1293
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,280
I shouldn't pay too much attention
to the things Hattie says.

1294
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,140
You were speaking of two different
people.

1295
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,140
Hattie was a gentle, warmhearted
girl. She would never have killed
anyone. Never.

1296
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,260
There remained one problem to be
dealt with.

1297
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,120
The man who knew the truth about
your son.

1298
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,100
John Merdell.

1299
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,300
His death is made to look like an
accident.

1300
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:15,220
As if he had fallen into the water
while he was drunk.

1301
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,140
But in fact it was murder, madame.

1302
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,280
Murder committed by your son.

1303
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,300
James Folliat.

1304
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,320
Alors, if you please to come with me,
madame.

1305
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,240
It is a good place to bury a body.

1306
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,160
A tree, it is uprooted in a storm.

1307
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,300
The soil, it is disturbed.

1308
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,180
And very soon, a young lady,
she is covered with concrete.

1309
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,340
And on the concrete,
a folly it is built.

1310
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,180
The folly of the owner of Nasse.

1311
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:13,320
Monsieur Poirot, I will face my
punishment, I assure you of that.

1312
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:19,300
But before I do, will you give me
a few moments with my son?

1313
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,260
As a courtesy to an old lady.

1314
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,260
As a courtesy from an old gentleman,
madame,

1315
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,180
I will allow it.

1316
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,140
Bless you.

1317
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,140
Right, let's bring in Sir George.

1318
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,260
If you please to wait.

1319
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,100
I have allowed
Madame Folliat a few moments.

1320
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,180
You've no authority to do that.

1321
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,300
Domage.

1322
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,280
It is done.

1323
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,220
Mother. And what are you doing here?

1324
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,300
Mm?

1325
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:30,220
They're digging up the folly.

1326
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,320
You know what they will find.

1327
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,200
Ruddy good scheme.

1328
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,280
Almost worked.

1329
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,140
It was like every one of your
schemes.

1330
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,100
It was cruel and criminal.

1331
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,220
And it failed.

1332
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,300
You have brought disgrace to the
family name.

1333
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,300
The name of Folliat.

1334
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Oh, dear God.

1335
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,260
What am I to do?

1336
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,300
You will do, James,

1337
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,260
exactly what I tell you.

1338
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,180
For once, just for once,

1339
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,140
you will obey your mother.

1340
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,180
What put you onto them?

1341
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,100
Intuition perhaps?

1342
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,160
Non, madame.

1343
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,300
The deduction.

1344
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,340
When old John Merdell told to me
there will always be Folliats at
Nasse,

1345
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,280
it was his little private joke.

1346
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:05,260
And Poirot,
he has realised this very late.

1347
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:10,180
You see, madame,

1348
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,300
he knew.

1349
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,280
So now will you release De Souza?

1350
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,180
Yes, all right.

1351
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,100
Time's up. Come on.

1352
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,200
What's he done? Quick!

1353
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,160
Follow me!

1354
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,260
Bon.
