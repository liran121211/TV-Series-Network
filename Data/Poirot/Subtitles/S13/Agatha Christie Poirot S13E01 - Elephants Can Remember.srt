It is with enormous pleasure

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,918
that I give you
our crime writer of the year,

6
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,560
Mrs Ariadne Oliver!

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,958
Surely you remember her?

8
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,999
Celia Ravenscroft.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,399
She's your god-daughter, is she not?

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,398
Is she?
It's just that one has so many.

11
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,638
Mrs Oliver,
may I have your autograph?

12
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,278
Thank you.

13
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:57,679
Oh, that Celia! I haven't seen her
in a very long time.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,718
Thank you.

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,759
May I confide in you?

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,639
There's something
I really must find out.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,678
Something of great moment.

18
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:08,718
A mystery.

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,199
Celia Ravenscroft, you see,
intends to marry my son Desmond.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,638
Why is that a mystery? Is there
something wrong with Desmond?

21
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,999
No, there's nothing wrong
with Desmond.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,039
No.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,638
But it's...
It's all just... very sudden.

24
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,679
And one has to know about people.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,679
Especially people one's welcoming
into one's family.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,959
Mrs Oliver,

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,999
what I want to know is this.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,678
Did her father kill her mother?

29
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,398
Or did the mother kill the father?

30
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,119
I don't think I heard you properly.
Pardon?

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,599
I know it was 12
or 13 years ago now.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,038
But it did cause a fuss at the time.

33
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,079
You must remember.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,479
General and Mrs Ravenscroft.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,639
Of course I remember,
it's just that I

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,798
couldn't quite believe
my ears, Mrs...

37
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,839
Burton-Cox.

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,799
Mrs Burton-Cox, it has been nice
meeting you.

39
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,399
But I must find out the truth.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,439
I'm at a loss to see how I...

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,638
Ask your god-daughter. Ask Celia.

42
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,278
Please.

43
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,559
I shouldn't dream
of doing such a thing.

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,799
It was impossible to shake her off.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,518
And now this frightful woman
wants me to quiz Celia about it.

49
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
What do you think she's after?

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,478
Je sais pas.
I don't know what I should do.

51
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,360
What would you do, were you me?

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,118
It is a question most difficult,
madame.

53
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,038
I know how I, Hercules Poirot,
would act in any circumstance.

54
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,799
But how you would act, madame,
I do not know that.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,838
I do not know that at all.
(PHONE)

56
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,839
Excuse-moi, s'il vous plait.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,839
Hercules Poirot speaks.

58
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Ah, my dear doctor...

59
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,239
If Poirot can be of any assistance...

60
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,279
He comes at once.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Tout de suite.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,159
George! My coat and my hat,
s'il vous plait!

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,198
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,839
Madame, it is my dear friend
Dr Willoughby. He has... some trouble.

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,078
Please to forgive me.
You haven't answered my question.

66
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,800
What should I do about
the dreadful Burton-Cox?

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,238
The thing that you should do, madame,

68
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,798
and this I advise you
to do most strenuously,

69
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,800
is nothing, rien.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Merci.

71
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,958
Oh, mais oui.
Poirot, thank God!

72
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,359
I am so sorry. Hello, Poirot.

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,398
I heard you were coming.

74
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,198
Ah, Detective Sergeant Beale!

75
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
Detective Inspector.

76
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,799
Was he still practising,
Dr Willoughby?

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,838
He'd been semi-retired for years.

78
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,878
In effect, I run the institute.

79
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,438
But my father kept his office
and continued his research.

80
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,478
He saw patients?

81
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,800
He hasn't treated anyone
for a long time.

82
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,719
This, it is how he was discovered?

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
That's correct.

84
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,078
Seen enough? Oui.

85
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,080
Drain it off. Sir.

86
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,919
In your kind of work, Doctor, is
this kind of contraption normal?

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,899
Hydriatic procedures in
the treatment of insanity

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,878
were quite common 20
years ago, Inspector.

89
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,038
I was not, I'm afraid, ever
convinced of their efficacy.

90
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,119
But I was the junior
and he was my father.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,758
And your father,
he employed this treatment?

92
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,119
He gave up on it in the end.

93
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,158
Concluded it was dangerous.

94
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,840
Looks like he was hit
on the head first.

(SIGHS)

96
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,959
Come away, Doctor.

97
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,680
I hope you don't
mind that I called

98
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,639
for Monsieur Poirot
straight away.

99
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,679
No, I don't.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,038
Poirot and I have worked together
before.

101
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,339
I hope you don't mind
my asking you to

102
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,639
vouch for your
movements last night.

103
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,719
You surely don't regard me
as a suspect?!

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,759
I'm just doing my job, sir.

105
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,798
This was my own father.

106
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:03,320
The procedure is quite standard,
cher ami.

107
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,320
Did you sleep at home?

108
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,399
No.

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,919
No. My wife lives in Kent
with the children.

110
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,238
It's not always convenient
for me to travel home at night.

111
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,279
So I keep an apartment here.

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,119
In the institute?
Upstairs. Nothing glamorous.

113
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,438
And that's where
you stayed last night?

114
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,439
Yes.

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Please excuse me.

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,358
Did you know your father
was in the building?

117
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,398
No, I had absolutely no idea.

118
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,758
But he keeps strange hours.
I mean... kept.

119
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,558
Dr Willoughby! Are you OK?

120
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,599
There's a cop on the door.

121
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,119
Please don't be alarmed, Marie.

122
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,798
This is my assistant,
Miss McDermott.

123
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,278
Mademoiselle.
Who are these guys?

124
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,279
What's going on around here?

125
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,478
It's very good to see you,
Mrs Oliver.

126
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,518
You should call me Ariadne.

127
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,639
Thank you for coming.
You said you worked nearby.

128
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,919
Yes. A solicitor's office.
Really?

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,759
We have much to catch up on,
haven't we, Celia?

130
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,798
Mm-hm.

131
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,839
It must have seemed odd,
my ringing up out of the blue.

132
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,518
I haven't been a very conscientious
godmother, I know.

133
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,199
I don't remember
coming to your confirmation.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,838
I don't remember having one.
Oh, dear.

135
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,259
But you sent a very nice
cheque on my 21st birthday.

136
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,678
So I would say your
duties are done.

137
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,119
Bizarre, though. I saw your photo
in the paper this morning.

138
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,639
Crime writer of the year.
And now we're having tea.

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,639
Yes, well... You see, a woman came
up and button-holed me.

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,758
She said 'I believe you have a
god-daughter named Celia Ravenscroft.'

141
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,799
Oh. Was she a friend of mine?

142
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
A Mrs Burton-Cox. She
said she thought

143
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,400
you might be going
to marry her son.

144
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,439
Douglas, is it? Desmond.

145
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,078
Desmond. What does Desmond do?

146
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,119
He's a pianist.

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,159
Splendid!

148
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,198
Making any money? God, no.

149
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,439
He's still at the Academy.
He gets a recital now and then.

150
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,358
It takes quite a while
to become a concert pianist.

151
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,398
I... I don't know what you know.

152
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,039
But I'm fond of Desmond.
And he's fond of me.

153
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,479
But his mother is something else
entirely.

154
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
What did she want?

155
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,439
She thought that,
since you were my godchild,

156
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,519
I might be able
to ask you something.

157
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,398
Something quite delicate.

158
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,399
What she went on to say was...

159
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,979
'Can you find out if her
father murdered her

160
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,199
mother or her mother
murdered her father?'

161
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,198
For God's sake, how dare she?!

162
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,279
She actually said that?! The beast!

163
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,839
She thought I might know
something about it.

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,318
But at the time, I was on
a lecture tour of America.

165
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,719
And you were... What, 14?

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,759
I was 12.

167
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,279
I was good friends with your mother.

168
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,279
We were finished together in Paris.

169
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
But then I married
and went somewhere

170
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:16,439
and she married and
went somewhere.

171
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,679
And then your father
was posted again.

172
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,719
Was it Rhodesia? India.

173
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,118
But I was sent to school in England.

174
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,079
In the holidays, I boarded
with a family in Suffolk.

175
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,599
I hardly saw Mummy and Daddy until
they retired to Eastbourne.

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,959
But you weren't at Eastbourne
when it...

177
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,599
No. I was away at school.

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,759
What can you tell me, Ariadne?

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,998
Have you got any inside knowledge?
No, my dear. I haven't.

180
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,119
I know only what I read
in the papers.

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,118
No obvious motive.

182
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,478
No sign of a quarrel. No evidence
of attack from outside.

183
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,559
Nobody knows.

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,199
That's just it. Nobody knows.

185
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,919
I was shielded from it
when I was young.

186
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
But I think of it constantly.

187
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,439
Please, please find out
what happened.

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,919
Not for Mrs Burton-Cox. For me.

189
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,958
I have to know.

190
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,998
Will you help me, Ariadne?

191
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,039
I have to help Celia.

192
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,079
The girl deserves to know.

193
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,039
Yet I can't, for the life of me,
see what to do!

194
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,598
How may one discover anything
years afterwards?

195
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,520
I know you're busy. But will you
help me look into it?

196
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,159
Je suis desole, madame.

197
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,240
I have an affair of consequence
to which I must attend.

198
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,198
The matter of the Ravenscrofts,
it is in the past.

199
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:38,599
And Poirot, he must march
in the present.

200
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,599
Give me one moment of your time.

201
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,398
My friend Margaret Ravenscroft
died a horrible death.

202
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,479
I have to find out why.

203
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
What should I do?

204
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,718
Bien sur.

205
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:55,159
Madame, what have you told to me, hm?

206
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,399
A husband and wife who never argue,
who live in complete harmony.

207
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,198
Whoever has heard
of such a thing?!

208
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,278
There was a motive.
There is always a motive.

209
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,918
And if the police, they could not
find this motive at the time,

210
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,279
then this motive, it is...
How do you say?

211
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,319
It is... unorthodox.

212
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,398
The answer, madame, lies in the past.

213
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,000
You must delve into the past.

214
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,358
You say they lived
near to Eastbourne?

215
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,199
You have acquaintance there?

216
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,719
Then go! Allez-y! Allez-y!

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
Drive about, ask the questions.
Be the person with a nose.

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,759
Oh, I see.
Someone will remember something.

219
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,959
Always someone remembers something.

220
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,998
You mean elephants.

221
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,438
Sorry, I was thinking of elephants
at that dinner last night.

222
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,479
With hesitation, I ask why.

223
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,999
Because the meringue
got stuck in my teeth.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,318
I see. The pathway of logic,
it is there somewhere.

225
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,599
Meringue, dentures.

226
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,638
Ivory, elephants.

227
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,678
Must find the elephants.

228
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,680
Elephants can remember.

229
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,921
POIROT: Then go. Drive about,
ask the questions.

230
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,961
Be the person with a nose.

231
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:24,601
If I had to say which was most
likely, I should say my father.

232
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:27,721
It's more natural for a man
to shoot someone, isn't it?

233
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:30,361
I don't think my mother
would have fired a gun.

234
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,362
(SHOTS)

235
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:45,081
Who else was in the house
when it happened?

236
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:48,641
There was an old housekeeper.
She was half blind and a bit deaf.

237
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,681
Sometimes there was my aunt.

238
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,241
And there was a foreign girl.
An au pair girl.

239
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,481
She'd be my governess
when I was young.

240
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:58,282
She'd come back to help Mummy,
who'd been unwell.

241
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,761
Ariadne!

242
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,762
My word!

243
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,042
Come in! Thank you.

244
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:20,081
Where did we last meet?
The Llewellyn wedding, was it?

245
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:23,921
All the bridesmaids
in a vile shade of apricot!

246
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:25,961
Funny, the things one remembers.

247
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:28,001
Bridesmaids!

248
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,041
Geldings.

249
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,081
Dogs.

250
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:35,641
Other things one forgets.
I saw my god-daughter the other day.

251
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,801
Celia Ravenscroft.
Do you remember the Ravenscrofts?

252
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,841
The Ravenscrofts.

253
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:44,841
Wait a minute. That was that
very sad tragedy, wasn't it?

254
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,081
Yes. It wasn't far from here.
I never knew them in Sussex.

255
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:50,961
I knew them in Amritsar.
Not in Sussex.

256
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:53,761
She used to wear a wig.
Do you remember?

257
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,801
Who? Margaret? Yes!

258
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,841
She wore a wig!

259
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:01,561
I don't know if she had cancer
if she was just bald.

260
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,601
She tried to persuade me to get one.

261
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,962
Bit bloody hard in Amritsar!

262
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,001
Awful business though.

263
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:12,561
At the time of the shooting,
I was in America.

264
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:16,601
Speaking engagements.
You're so modern, Ariadne!

265
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:20,642
No-one else in my circle
has speaking engagements!

266
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:24,682
They only left the house
to take a walk.

267
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,682
They didn't come back
for their dinner.

268
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:33,441
Somebody or other found them dead.

269
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:36,481
The revolver was lying
by their bodies.

270
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:39,521
Bloody hard on the dog, I thought.

271
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,561
Rotten way to treat an animal.

272
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:45,601
They kept a revolver in the house?
Military type. They often do.

273
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,641
Fear of the natives, you see.

274
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,642
Not usually a problem in Sussex.

275
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:57,282
Unfathomable things
in everybody's lives.

276
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,241
She was neurotic, always.
Was she?

277
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:04,961
Very nervy.
Didn't like India at all.

278
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,001
Odd girl.

279
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,761
And the other one.
I expect you heard the gossip.

280
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,041
What was the gossip, Julia?

281
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:16,001
He was writing his memoirs.
She was taking dictation.

282
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:18,481
Who? Margaret? No!

283
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,482
The French girl!

284
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,841
She was young. And French.

285
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,842
There was talk.

286
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:30,282
People thought he
might have shot his

287
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,361
wife because he
wanted to marry her.

288
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,881
Then why shoot himself as well?
Good point!

289
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:37,881
I always thought
it was more about Margaret.

290
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:40,721
I can't help thinking
there might have been a man.

291
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:43,201
Why do you think that?
Oh, the wigs.

292
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,121
Sexual display. Mating ritual.

293
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,041
I thought you said she had them
because she was bald.

294
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,161
Oh, she was pretty too.

295
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,201
Legs.

296
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:56,041
All I'm saying is one of them
was having an affair.

297
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:59,041
In this part of the world, Ariadne,

298
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:02,042
one either hunts or one has affairs.

299
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,841
It is a variation on what the French
call le bain de surprise.

300
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:10,881
I should say it's a surprise.

301
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:13,641
Hot water followed by cold water.
Is that right?

302
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:16,201
Oui. The scalding hot
and the freezing cold.

303
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,521
The principle, it is one
of severe shock to the system.

304
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:24,361
And is often used in conjunction
with the electro-shock therapy.

305
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:26,362
Bloody hell.

306
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:29,881
I'm quite glad I'm normal.

307
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,802
We may all be thankful,
mon ami, that

308
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,721
we are in possession
of our minds.

309
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,761
Some of us more so than others.

310
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:38,001
But the question, it is this.

311
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:42,361
Who has brought le professeur
to this place and secured him?

312
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,082
The night watchman
said the door wasn't forced.

313
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,441
Is there a key that is missing?
No.

314
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,442
Everything is in order.

315
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,001
No fingerprints.
And Dr Willoughby himself?

316
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:56,041
The man's in shock.

317
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,001
I let him go back to Kent.
We can interview him later.

318
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,041
Oh. Er... Hi.

319
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,561
You mind me coming in?
It's against regulations.

320
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,601
No, no, mademoiselle. Pas du tout.

321
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:07,481
Levez-vous a l'avance?

322
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,521
Huh?

323
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,561
No.

324
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,601
I've never been down here before.

325
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:15,602
Creepy, isn't it?

326
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:20,682
I have the kettle boiling if you
gentlemen would like a cup of tea.

327
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,441
Do you live locally, Miss McDermott?
James Street.

328
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,481
It's about a ten-minute walk.

329
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,201
Did you walk home on the night
Professor Willoughby was murdered?

330
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,041
Yes.

331
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,081
Do you live alone? No.

332
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,401
I share an apartment
with some other girls.

333
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:40,241
Is there someone can vouch for you
being at home all night?

334
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,361
Did I say I was at home all night?
I don't remember that.

335
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:46,721
May I enquire, mademoiselle,
from where do you originate?

336
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,761
Boston area.

337
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,921
But I always wanted
to come to London.

338
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,841
I guess I just had a yen
to live in England for a while

339
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,761
and do the things
that English people do.

340
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,601
By which, I do not mean murdering
eminent professors of psychiatry.

341
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:03,721
So you think it was an English
person who has done this.

342
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,081
I'd say the stakes are high,
wouldn't you?

343
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,641
How well did you know
Professor Willoughby?

344
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:10,681
I didn't know him at all.

345
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,321
You can't tell us anything about
what he's currently working on.

346
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:18,361
I'm a filing clerk. I don't know
anything about psychiatry.

347
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,401
I do the files from A to Zed.

348
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:25,001
I just answer the telephone,
make the tea.

349
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:27,841
If you please to return
to the night of the murder.

350
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:30,201
At what hour did you leave your work?

351
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,001
Usual time. Around 5:30.

352
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,041
And where did you go then?

353
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,081
I went home.

354
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,082
But you just said you didn't.

355
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,121
I don't think so.

356
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,161
It's a murder inquiry, miss.

357
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,201
Yeah.

358
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,241
OK, I'm sorry.

359
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:51,881
Er... I went home.

360
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:53,882
I didn't see any of the other girls.

361
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,081
I had sardines on toast.

362
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:59,122
And then I went to bed.

363
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,482
So nobody can corroborate
your story.

364
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,601
I guess not.

365
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,382
It is strange that
Dr Willoughby also

366
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:10,161
has no alibi for the
night in question.

367
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:13,041
He doesn't? But surely his wife...

368
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,481
He says he spent the night
here in his flat.

369
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,521
Oh.

370
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,561
I see.

371
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,601
I didn't know that.

372
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,602
I assumed he'd gone home.

373
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:38,121
Does Nanny Matcham -
I mean Mrs Matcham - live here?

374
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:42,281
Who shall I say?
Say... Miss Ariadne.

375
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,282
Come in, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

376
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,441
Well, well, it must be years!

377
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,481
It IS years, Nanny.

378
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,961
What a lot of photographs you have.

379
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,001
Yes, I have, haven't I?

380
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:59,001
All my little boys and girls.

381
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:01,041
All over the world I went.

382
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,081
I know, Nanny.

383
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:05,121
Where were you? In India?

384
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:08,481
Shimla. Hong Kong. Egypt.

385
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:11,161
That time I came out to the Punjab,

386
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,521
20-odd years ago.

387
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,761
Was it the Ravenscrofts
you were with?

388
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,801
Service family.

389
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,961
Did you look after their children?
No.

390
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,001
Not me. No, I was with the Barnabys.

391
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:25,081
Here's your tea, Mrs Matcham.

392
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,121
Thank you, my dear.

393
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:30,321
Of course, I knew the Ravenscrofts.

394
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,841
They were great friends
with the Barnabys.

395
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:35,882
Were they?
Yes. And the Burton-Coxes.

396
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,841
I'll finish that.
I'll get on with the laundry.

397
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,881
Thank you, my dear.

398
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:44,882
You really are such a help.

399
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:49,041
Did you say the Burton-Coxes?

400
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,881
Or did I mean the Carter-Foxes?

401
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:56,281
You know who I mean.
They were great friends.

402
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,281
Everybody was very friendly
out there.

403
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:02,322
Did you by any chance meet the

404
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:05,361
Ravenscrofts when you
were on that visit?

405
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:07,401
No, I didn't.

406
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,441
What were they like?

407
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:11,442
Well...

408
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,761
They had that trouble.

409
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,801
What trouble was that, Nanny?

410
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,841
Oh, an awful thing happened.

411
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:20,842
Did it?

412
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,881
I heard they were a nice couple.

413
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:30,161
Oh. Yes, yes, they were
a very nice couple.

414
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:32,201
And it was a shock.

415
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:35,481
They said that she'd always been
touched.

416
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:41,482
And then there was that story
of the baby and the river.

417
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,601
Took the babe from its pram.

418
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:48,041
And threw it into the river.

419
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:51,442
Just threw it into the river.

420
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,481
What was the trouble in Amritsar,
Nanny?

421
00:22:57,482 --> 00:23:01,561
Well, she was in that mental place.

422
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,642
And they let her out.

423
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:06,681
It happened all over again.

424
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,721
What happened, Nanny?

425
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,641
They'd let her have them back,
the boy and the girl.

426
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,681
It was the boy this time.

427
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:16,401
Of course, we all knew it was her.

428
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:18,441
Who, Nanny?

429
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,442
Well, whichever one of them it was.

430
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,682
It's so lovely to see you again.

431
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:29,921
I remember you when you had
your little button boots.

432
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,682
You followed me down the lane.

433
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:38,281
They...

434
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,921
They fell off a cliff.

435
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,961
Didn't they?

436
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:45,801
Or something of that kind.

437
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:48,322
Something of that kind, Nanny, yes.

438
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:55,522
Nanny?

439
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,881
Mrs Buckle, she's fast asleep.

440
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,041
Perhaps you could -
She likes her nap.

441
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:08,081
Leave her to me. Thank you.

442
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:11,121
Ma'am, was you asking
about the general and his wife?

443
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:14,041
Yes. Did you know them?
Used to char for them, I did.

444
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,681
My day was a Tuesday so I...

445
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:19,041
Do you mind if I ask you something
direct? I've had a long day.

446
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:22,001
Do you think it was a suicide pact?
No. Not them.

447
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,022
They were happy. She
was a bonny woman.

448
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,041
Always beautifully turned out.

449
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:28,281
I believe she'd taken
to wearing a wig.

450
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,441
Yeah, she had several wigs.
Several?

451
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:34,201
Four. Proper expensive. One was
auburn. One had little grey curls.

452
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,122
She used to send them
to a place up in London

453
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:38,041
to get redressed
. Eugene and something.

454
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,081
Was she in poor health?
She was.

455
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:41,842
I don't know what
was wrong with her,

456
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:43,601
but she had to
have an operation.

457
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:46,441
She went up Harley Street.
When she come back, she was better.

458
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,601
The general?
A bit of heart trouble.

459
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:50,721
But he took his pills
and he was fine.

460
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,241
He enjoyed it when the sister
came to visit.

461
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,801
Sister? Whose sister?
Lady Ravenscroft's.

462
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,802
I didn't know she had a sister.

463
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:17,522
Sir, I appreciate
this is a time of loss. But...

464
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:21,961
You say Professor Willoughby
was retired.

465
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:24,001
I said semi-retired.

466
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:26,241
Did he come to the institute
every day?

467
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:30,081
My father kept to his own timetable.
Which was, I concede, erratic.

468
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:32,721
He'd work all night and sleep
all day if it suited him.

469
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:34,361
Was he married?

470
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:36,521
My mother passed away
some years ago.

471
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:39,201
Never remarried? Some gentlemen do.
No.

472
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:41,241
No, he did not remarry.

473
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,801
Does the Willoughby Institute
pass to you now, sir?

474
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:45,801
Not at all. It's run by a trust.

475
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:47,881
I'm a trustee, that's all.

476
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:51,222
Are you aware of any
resentment, any

477
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:54,561
animosity, professional
or otherwise,

478
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:56,881
which your father
might have incurred?

479
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:59,001
My father was very highly respected.

480
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:01,081
And it was last night
that you told me

481
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,662
that it is many years since
your father abandoned

482
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:06,241
his experiments with
the hydrotherapy.

483
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:07,881
Yes, that's right.

484
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,921
And this is not a technique
that you yourself employ?

485
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:12,961
No. I talk to my patients.

486
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,881
I prescribe appropriate medication.

487
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:18,762
Look, the hydro room
has been in disuse

488
00:26:18,763 --> 00:26:21,641
for just about as long
as I can remember.

489
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:23,881
And yet the murderer
knew how to use it.

490
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,081
So it would seem.

491
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:28,801
I think you know how to use it too.
Don't you, sir?

492

(DOOR OPENS)

493
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,641
I thought you might need some tea.

494
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,721
Thank you, Jacqueline.

495
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,081
Mrs Willoughby,
your house is charming.

496
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:40,081
Thank you.

497
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:43,641
I understand you also keep a small
apartment at the institute.

498
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:45,641
That's not mine. That's his.

499
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:47,682
I've barely been in it.

500
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,682
Ahem.

501
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,202
Sugar?

502
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:01,281
Must have been someone quite strong,
or more than one person,

503
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,482
to have manipulated the professor
into the contraption.

504
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:09,081
Either that or he got into it
voluntarily.

505
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:11,082
Why on earth would he do so?

506
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:14,561
Je ne sais pas.

507
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,822
But it seems as though
someone is giving

508
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:19,081
him back a soupcon
of his own medicine.

509
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:22,921
Medicine he hasn't used
in nigh on 20 years.

510
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:25,522
You think it's a patient
with a grievance?

511
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,602
It's possible.

We need to talk.

Hello. Inspector Beale, isn't it?

Good evening, Mrs Oliver.
Are you well?

518
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,882
I'm absolutely jiggered.
I've spent all day

519
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,041
driving round Sussex
chasing elephants.

520
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,481
Right. Well... Good luck.

No, no, you must think me

I don't mean real elephants.
I mean people elephants.

523
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,002
I'm trying to find
out if anyone can

524
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,961
recall anything of the
Ravenscroft case.

526
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:22,721
That was a curly one. Still is.

527
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:24,761
I know the officer on the case.

528
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:27,121
Bill Garroway. Retired now.

529
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,161
May I have his number?

530
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:31,201
I should have it here somewhere.

531
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:33,241
(HUMMING)

532
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,242
Celia?

533
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,282
Ohh!

534
00:28:48,282 --> 00:28:50,282
Are you all right?

535
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,321
Oh! Good, strong black coffee.
Just what I need.

536
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,761
Merci, madame.

537
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:05,081
These are all the people
I interviewed.

538
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:07,062
I wrote down everything
that seemed pertinent.

539
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:09,041
But it's such a muddle.

540
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:11,201
The principal suggestions are these.

541
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:15,521
That General Ravenscroft was writing
his memoir of his India days.

542
00:29:15,522 --> 00:29:18,042
And that he was
smitten with a young

543
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:20,561
woman who acted
as his secretary.

544
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:22,622
The result being that
he shot his wife

545
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:24,682
because he hoped
to marry the girl.

546
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:28,761
But then was horror-stricken
by what he had done.

547
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,801
And shot himself.

548
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,521
Or Margaret discovered the affair.

549
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,522
And then shot him.

550
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,161
And then herself.

551
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:42,201
Oh, and Margaret had been ill.

552
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,241
Possibly cancer.

553
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,281
It appears her hair had fallen out.

554
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,321
Because she had several wigs.

555
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:52,761
It says here... she had four wigs.

556
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:54,801
Four.

557
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:56,462
What do you think, madame?
Do you

558
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,121
think that seems a
little excessive?

559
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,642
I do really. You might
have one, and an extra

560
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:03,161
one for when you sent the
other to be dressed.

561
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,762
But why did she have four?

562
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,361
I haven't got anywhere, have I?
Mais bien.

563
00:30:10,362 --> 00:30:14,121
I think it will always
remain a mystery, madame.

564
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,422
And now I must set
myself to consider

565
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,721
the case of Professor
Willoughby.

566
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:21,602
I bid you good night.
I even went to see my old nanny.

567
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:24,881
She knew the Ravenscrofts in India.

568
00:30:24,882 --> 00:30:28,721
She was sure there was
a mental case in the family.

569
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:31,641
One of them - Nanny wasn't sure
which - was unstable.

570
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:33,481
One of whom?
One of the sisters.

571
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,041
The sisters?
Margaret had a sister.

572
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,081
Never heard of her before.

573
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:40,121
She wasn't at Margaret's wedding.

574
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:42,161
That's odd in itself, isn't it?

575
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:44,201
Continuer de parler, madame.

576
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:46,881
She was in an asylum for years.

577
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:50,401
It seems possible
that she'd killed children.

578
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:52,441
Even, perhaps, her own children.

579
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:54,481
Then she'd had treatment.

580
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:59,242
Then she was cured. Or paroled.
Or released, at any rate.

581
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:04,041
She went out to Margaret in India,
where there was another incident.

582
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:07,081
Again connected with children.
Which was hushed up.

583
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:10,241
But might that explain
what's worrying Mrs Burton-Cox?

584
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:12,281
Insanity in the family.
Non, non.

585
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:15,241
No, madame, that is conjecture
merely.

586
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:17,522
What you discovered
in Sussex was merely

587
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:19,801
the mirrors and the smoke.
Nothing real.

588
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:22,062
Madame, what is certain
is that they were

589
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:24,321
a couple who were
devoted to each other

590
00:31:24,322 --> 00:31:26,361
and lived together happily.

591
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:30,241
So why, on the evening
of the most beautiful day,

592
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:33,201
should they take a walk together
along the cliffs,

593
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:37,121
taking with them a revolver
and a dog?

594
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,881
What's the dog got to do with it?
Je sais pas.

595
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:42,601
But all of your elephants,
they mentioned the dog.

596
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:43,641
Yes.

597
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:45,681
Tell to me something that was said.

598
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:48,522
One of the elephants
said that the

599
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:51,361
dog was devoted to
Lady Ravenscroft.

600
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:53,362
Another said that it bit her.

601
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,121
No, no. It is nothing.

602
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:01,562
Merely an elephant remembering a dog.

603
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:05,682
I can help you no further, madame.
Pardonnez-moi.

604
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,241
My name is Desmond Burton-Cox.

605
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,081
Yes. I have heard of the enquiries
of your mother.

606
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:30,841
Monsieur, please to be brief.
As you can see, I am very busy.

607
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:33,961
My mother had no right
pestering Mrs Oliver like that.

608
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:36,521
It's no concern of hers
whether I marry Celia.

609
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,561
Mothers are always concerned.

610
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,882
She's not really my mother.
I'm adopted.

611
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:44,561
Why are you here, monsieur?

612
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,601
Someone attacked me at the music
school this evening.

613
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,961
And you do not know who it was.
No, I don't.

614
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:54,681
The point is,
my mother's a little... unhinged.

615
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,921
I fear she may have put someone
up to it.

616
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,922
Why should she wish to do that?

617
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:05,201
When I was a child, let's just say
she did some terrible things.

618
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:07,641
Now she wants to stop me
getting married.

619
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:10,601
She's been trying to scare Celia
with awful rumours...

620
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,761
How long have you known
Mademoiselle Celia, monsieur?

621
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,801
All my life.

622
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:17,841
My people were in India, like hers.

623
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:21,721
I was boarded for the holidays
in Suffolk. We played together.

624
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:24,561
But why should your mother
wish to stop you getting married?

625
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:27,321
Because she's mean, possessive.

626
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,642
If you go against her,
she's vindictive.

627
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,241
When I was 15, she took me
to a psychiatrist.

628
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,281
Pour quoi?

629
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:38,722
I'd formed an attachment to someone
and I wouldn't give it up.

630
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:43,002
My mother was livid and marched me
off to Dr Willoughby.

631
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,921
Please to sit.

632
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,479
Oh, darling!

633
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,919
What the goddam hell
have you been saying?

634
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,199
My wife...

635
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,239
I thought you had her under control!

636
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,279
And who saw you that evening?

637
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,999
I can't remember.
I don't know if anyone saw me.

638
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,039
I might have gone for a walk.

639
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,079
I can't remember.

640
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,119
What was your father working on?

641
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,999
Did he have...
a special line of enquiry?

642
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,039
Behaviour patterns in twins.

643
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,079
Genetic characteristics,

644
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,239
similar and dissimilar environments,

645
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,519
blood types, pathologies.

646
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,559
What else would you like to know?

647
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,240
The name of someone who could vouch
for your whereabouts, Doctor.

648
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,000
Otherwise, you're in a bit
of a sticky wicket, aren't you?

649
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,519
Hey.

650
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,359
Got a minute?

651
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Pardon?

652
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,460
May I exchange a word or
two, Detective Inspector?

653
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:03,520
If you would be so kind.

654
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,640
Inspector Garroway, if you please
to tell us everything you know.

655
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,399
The Ravenscrofts married in 1913.

656
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,519
She was a well-born girl.
Originally from Kent.

657
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,479
She had a sister, Dorothea,
who married a Captain Jarrow.

658
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,639
They were blighted by misfortune
though.

659
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,679
Dorothea's husband died in the war.

660
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,719
Leaving her with two children.

661
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,559
The youngest, a boy,
fell into a pond and drowned.

662
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,999
At first, they said
the older sister was to blame.

663
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,560
But then it turned out
there was another story.

664
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,119
One of the neighbours said the
mother herself had done it.

665
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,159
Got angry with the boy.

666
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,399
Pushed him in the pond.
Held him under.

667
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,759
She breaks down under questioning.

668
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,879
I mean, she went raving mad.

669
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,919
Had to be hospitalised.

670
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,559
She spends years in treatment.

671
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,839
And then, for some reason,
they pronounce her cured.

672
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,159
And she returns to live
with the family.

673
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,380
So, Mr Garroway, was
she staying with

674
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,599
the Ravenscrofts
when they were shot?

675
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,639
No. Are you sure?

676
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,679
Yes. She died three weeks before.

677
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,519
She takes a lot of tranquilisers
and she sleepwalks.

678
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,559
One night, she leaves the house,

679
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,599
wanders along the cliff edge,

680
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,800
loses her footing,
and over she goes.

681
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
They don't find her
till the next morning.

682
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,359
Lady Ravenscroft took it very bad.

683
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,719
Had a bit of a breakdown herself.

684
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,319
She spends a fortnight
in a sanatorium.

685
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,160
Then she comes back,
apparently better.

686
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,080
Three days later, she's dead.

687
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,599
No-one has the first idea
of a motive, then or now.

688
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,639
The general has a good record.

689
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,679
The wife is well liked.

690
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,719
They played piquet in the evening.

691
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,759
Go for walks.

692
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,799
No money worries.

693
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,480
A bit of poor health,
but time of life.

694
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,759
Were there fingerprints
on the weapon?

695
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,799
Clear prints of the both of them.

696
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,159
But no suggestion
as to who fired it last.

697
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,199
Could there be a third party?

698
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,719
They would have had to
have got ruddy close!

699
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,759
No, it all points to a suicide pact
and yet...

700
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
With the suicide,
they leave the notes.

701
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,160
Exactly.
Could someone have stolen the note?

702
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Who else was in the house
on that day?

703
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,399
There was...

704
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,159
A Betsy Whittaker.

705
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,599
Cook and housekeeper. Been
with them since the dawn of time.

706
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,639
Didn't see too clearly.
Nor hear too clearly either.

707
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,279
There was a visitor staying.
A Zelie Rouxelle.

708
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,079
Foreign. Don't think
she understood much.

709
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,999
And the gardener.
His alibi stood up. That's it.

710
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,319
Have you interviewed
Betsy Whittaker?

711
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,479
She was more concerned
about the dog.

712
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,519
Le chien.

713
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,040
What do you think happened,
Superintendent?

714
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,279
I think old sins have long shadows.

715
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
That's what my mother used to say.

716
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,559
Oui.

717
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,719
Madame, do we have the name
of the supplier of the wigs?

718
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,559
Why are you suddenly interested?
You didn't care tuppence before!

719
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,319
I've got that. It's Eugene and
Rosentelle. Formerly of Bond Street.

720
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Now Tooting Bec.

721
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,839
Good afternoon.
Have you an appointment?

722
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,879
No, I'm afraid I haven't.

723
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,199
You're in luck. Monsieur Eugene
can do you in ten minutes.

724
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,239
Is it a permanent today?
No, no.

725
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,279
That sounds horrible.

726
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,200
I don't think it
could be much worse

727
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:46,119
than it already is,
do you, madam?

728
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,159
Let us take off
the split ends, at least.

729
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,040
No, thank you. I would
simply like to ask you some

730
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,919
questions about Eugene and
Rosentelle of Bond Street.

731
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,639
Hairpieces to the gentry.
Oh, the old days.

732
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,679
Bond Street, Bert. Remember?

733
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,719
That was the life.

734
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,759
But Tooting seems most pleasant.

735
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,799
What does madam want?

736
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,599
I would like to ask you
about a former client.

737
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,519
I want to know about some wigs.
I'm terribly sorry.

738
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,559
We do not do wigs no more.

739
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,999
They were for a friend of mine.
A person I went to school with.

740
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,079
Lady Ravenscroft.

741
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,199
You was at school
with Lady Ravenscroft?

742
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,039
Yes. Yes, I was.

743
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,479
Where do you live now,
Buckingham Palace?

744
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Mayfair.

745
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,519
How may we be of assistance,
Your Ladyship?

746
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,519
Perhaps you remember the tragedy
at Eastbourne 13 years ago.

747
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,420
I'm looking into it
on behalf of their

748
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,319
daughter, the Honourable
Celia Ravenscroft.

749
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,639
Oh, Lady Ravenscroft.
Yes. She was so nice.

750
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,079
Good-looking too. I remember
reading about it in the paper.

751
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,119
She had four wigs, didn't she?

752
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,999
Do people often have four?
Most people have two.

753
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,799
Lady Ravenscroft had two
to begin with.

754
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,839
Then she ordered extra.

755
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,359
Did she come to Bond Street
to collect them?

756
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,560
No. I think it was a young
lady, a French lady, come

757
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,759
up and give us all the sizes
and colours and styles.

758
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,119
There was one with a pretty grey
streak in it for parties.

759
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,319
And one with strawberry-blonde
curls, I recall.

760
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,359
One of Bert's finest.

761
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,399
I remember thinking,
when I read about the business,

762
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,460
'That's bleedin' odd.
It's only three

763
00:40:25,461 --> 00:40:27,519
weeks ago she's bought new wigs.

764
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
Now she's gone and shot herself.'
Imagine!

765
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,239
Ah.

766
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,439
Mademoiselle Ravenscroft.
Hercules Poirot.

767
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,519
I...

768
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
I thought Mrs Oliver was meeting me.

769
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,260
Ah. I see the Madame
Oliver, she has

770
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,879
been rather vague
with her invitation.

771
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,319
It is I that you are meeting,
mademoiselle.

772
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Please to permit.

773
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,960
I am a private detective.
I assist Madame

774
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:01,319
Oliver with her enquiries
on your behalf.

775
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Please to sit, mademoiselle.

776
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Thank you.

777
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,679
Mademoiselle, Monsieur Burton-Cox,
he has been to see me.

778
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,999
Oh. I thought
he was rehearsing all day.

779
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,559
There's a concert tomorrow.
Beverley Hall. Quite important.

780
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,840
It was last night that he has come
to see me, mademoiselle.

781
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
He cares for you most deeply.

782
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,119
Mademoiselle, may I ask you
a question that is personal?

783
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,879
I don't know who you are so...

784
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,199
Do you wish to marry
Desmond Burton-Cox?

785
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,239
Yes, I do. Satisfied?

786
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,279
Then nothing should prevent it.

787
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,600
If you are in love
with Monsieur Desmond

788
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,919
Burton-Cox, then that
is all that matters.

789
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,239
The rest of your life
with Monsieur Desmond Burton-Cox

790
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,199
is all that you should
be concerned with. N'est-ce pas?

791
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,039
Is he well provided for financially?
Excuse me. That's damned rude.

792
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,999
Pardon.
He has a rather pitiful allowance.

793
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,439
But I have my own means.
I work for a living.

794
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,479
Bien sur.

795
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,780
This allowance,
mademoiselle, it is

796
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:11,080
something that his
mother could withhold?

797
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,999
You mean she'd cut off the money
if he marries me?

798
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,039
I hadn't thought of that.

799
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,879
You know who is his natural mother?
No, no, I don't.

800
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,919
Does he? I don't think so.

801
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,679
He doesn't worry about it.
He's not a worrying kind.

802
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,799
But you are, mademoiselle. Mais oui?

803
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
You are.

804
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,439
Tell to me, if you please,
Madame Burton-Cox,

805
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,359
was she friendly
with your late mother and father?

806
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,399
Did you ever meet her as a child?

807
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,039
I don't think I did.
I know she was out in India.

808
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,599
My people were too. But I was at
school or holidaying in Suffolk.

809
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,759
That's where I met Desmond.
In the care of a French girl.

810
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,560
Yes, yes. Zelie. Lovely Zelie.

811
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,439
Look, whoever you are,
if I'm going to marry Desmond,

812
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,359
and live with him forever,
I need to know the truth.

813
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,559
I don't want dark secrets
in our lives.

814
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
I want the truth.

815
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
But the truth, mademoiselle...

816
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
..she can be cruel.

817
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,039
(PHONE)

818
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,079
Hercules Poirot speaks.

819
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,999
Poirot, it's Inspector Beale. I have
that information you asked for.

820
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,999
Desmond Burton-Cox's natural mother
was an actress.

821
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,380
She moved to California,
where she found

822
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:30,759
considerable success
in moving pictures

823
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,799
under the name Katy Lestrange.

824
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,300
18 months ago, Katy
Lestrange died of

825
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,799
a barbiturate
overdose in Pasadena.

826
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,220
She left her entire
fortune, several million

827
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:42,639
dollars, to her son
Desmond in a trust.

828
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,679
He gets it when he's 25.

829
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,519
And who administers this trust?
Who do you think?

830
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Mrs Burton-Cox.

831
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,999
Can you get for me
the deed of covenant?

832
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,700
I'll give it a go. Oh,
and Poirot, could

833
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,399
you come over to the
Willoughby Institute?

834
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,960
There's been something of a turn-up.
Oui. Tout de suite.

835
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Miss McDermott,
will you come in now, please?

836
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,599
Repeat to Mr Poirot
what you said earlier.

837
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Asseyez-vous, mademoiselle.

838
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,519
On the night of the murder,

839
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,400
Dr Willoughby was with me.

840
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,960
Here in his flat.

841
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,239
In bed.

842
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,279
He's a decent man.

843
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,800
He's trying to save my reputation.

844
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,119
But I can't stand by and see him
swing for something he didn't do.

845
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,120
And he was with you all of the night?

846
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,119
Till dawn.

847
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,159
We slept a little.

848
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,800
Then I went home. Had a bath.

849
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
And came back to work again.

850
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
It must have been
at that time that

851
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,639
the night watchman
raised the alarm.

852
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,679
David...

853
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,719
Dr Willoughby...

854
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,760
..elected to keep his mouth shut
for my sake.

855
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
But he is a fool.

856
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,759
It is a brave thing that you do,
ma petite.

857
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,719
My reputation was shot
in the States.

858
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Might as well be shot here too.

859
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,159
I have a question.

860
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,360
It was last summer
that you arrived in England?

861
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,919
Yes. Six months ago.

862
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,959
On the SS France.

863
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,240
So you were still living in Boston
in March of this year.

864
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,159
Yes.

865
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,879
Can you remember what you were doing
on the 17th?

866
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,919
The 17th of March?

867
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
Oui.

868
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,639
How am I expected to remember that?
You do not recall this day?

869
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,359
No. I don't.

870
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,359
No idea.

871
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,400
Bon.

872
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,080
Do you know a Mademoiselle
Celia Ravenscroft?

873
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,439
Never heard of her. Who is she?

874
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,040
Oh, it is of no consequence.

875
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,800
Detective Inspector,
may I have the use of your car?

876
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Merci.

877
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,839
I'm not exactly proud of myself,
Poirot.

878
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,159
Things are pretty awkward
around here.

879
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,380
Somehow Jacqueline
seems to have found

880
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,599
out about the whole
wretched business.

881
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,280
You asked her to perjure herself
in court and she would not?

882
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
I'm afraid that is correct.

883
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,359
Mademoiselle Marie McDermott,
she provides you with the alibi

884
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,400
and you are no longer the suspect.

885
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,159
She said something about the
dictates of her conscience.

886
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,199
She's quite religious, you know.

887
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,639
She is Catholic?
Irish background, I believe.

888
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
Nice girl.

889
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,599
Tell to me more about the patients
of your father.

890
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,199
Do you recall a Dorothea Jarrow?

891
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,239
Of course. He treated her
for quite a long time.

892
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,759
My father took a special interest.
Merci.

893
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,199
She's dead now, isn't she?
Oui, d'accord.

894
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,680
What can you tell to me
about her treatment?

895
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,239
Mrs Jarrow was considered to be
one of my father's triumphs.

896
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,639
Her husband had died
on the Western front.

897
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,119
That left her rather fragile,
I'm afraid.

898
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,519
So she was disturbed mentally.

899
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,359
No. No, that this point,
she was not thought to be.

900
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,439
But her GP had called in my father

901
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,620
because she didn't
seem to be getting

902
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:09,799
over her bereavement
in the normal way.

903
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,839
Whatever that may be.

904
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,800
To my father's eyes,
Dorothea's condition

905
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,759
presented very decided dangers.

906
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,759
She was prone to mood swings
and acts of violence.

907
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,559
He thought she should be kept
under observation.

908
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,359
And he was proved right. Because
then the first incident happened.

909
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,359
Oui. A boy, he has drowned.

910
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,439
Yes. How did you know?

911
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,960
According to Mrs Jarrow,
her elder child, a

912
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,479
girl, had attacked the
younger, a little boy.

913
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,700
She said she hit him
with a spade and he

914
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:40,919
fell into an ornamental
pond and drowned.

915
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,559
At first, Mrs Jarrow's version
was believed.

916
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,719
And then other stories
started to emerge.

917
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,759
Housemaid, telegraph boy.

918
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,420
Both said they saw
Mrs Jarrow push her

919
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:54,079
son into the water
and hold him under.

920
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,640
The court ruled that Mrs
Jarrow should be committed

921
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,200
to secure psychiatric care.
And she was.

922
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,719
But you see, my poor late father

923
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,719
subscribed to a new school
of treatment.

924
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,919
Which held that once certain
rehabilitation targets had been reached,

925
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,439
targets attainable by hydrotherapy
and electro-shock,

926
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,840
the patient could resume
a normal life.

927
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,199
And this treatment of hydrotherapy,
it was administered to Dorothea?

928
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,719
Yes. And in due course, two
or three years, home she went.

929
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,680
She was considered
to be completely recovered.

930
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,119
Shortly afterwards,
she went to India.

931
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,839
Stayed with her twin sister
who was in Amritsar...

932
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,919
Excuse me, mon ami.

933
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Did you say her twin sister?
Yes.

934
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,239
They were twins. Yes.

935
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,359
Madame Jarrow and Lady Ravenscroft.

936
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,799
Margaret and Dorothea were twins?!

937
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,839
Why has no person told to me this?

938
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,199
But this was my father's special
area of research.

939
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,279
I thought you knew. No.

940
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,279
He was an authority on twins.

941
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,119
So perhaps Margaret suffers
from the same malady as Dorothea.

942
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,439
No, no, she was perfectly sane.

943
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,559
And devoted to looking after
her unfortunate sibling.

944
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,999
General Ravenscroft had throughout
paid for his sister-in-law

945
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,439
to receive the best treatment
in England.

946
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
He was on good terms with my father.

947
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,479
When they returned from India,
they often had Dorothea to stay.

948
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,519
Why was he so kind to her?

949
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,639
Well, I think I can tell you that.

950
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,439
When he was a young subaltern,

951
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,640
Dorothea was considered
a fabulously beautiful woman.

952
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,360
Alistair Ravenscroft
fell in love with her.

953
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,239
And then, I think,
he caught a glimpse.

954
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,719
Saw behind the eyes the danger zone.

955
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,440
And so he proposed to Margaret
instead.

956
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,959
He marries the sister
but he is in love with them both!

957
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,999
The devil!

958
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,439
Poirot, he owes to you an apology,
madame. He is imbecile.

959
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,879
I see now that the two cases
are connected.

960
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,639
There is a point of conversion
which links them.

961
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,000
What is that?
The Willoughby Institute.

962
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,721
Morning.

963
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:24,281
Ah, Poirot. I forgot you'd be here.

964
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,282
One word if I may, Doctor.
Please.

965
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,922
Mademoiselle.

966
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:35,482
In your files, mon
ami, there are many

967
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:37,601
histories that are
very absorbing.

968
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:40,321
But you know there is a patient
that is missing?

969
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:42,582
I ask about the boy who
has 15 years of age.

970
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,841
A certain Desmond Burton-Cox.

971
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:46,842
Where is his case file?

972
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,561
Um...

973
00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:53,321
There is no case file, Poirot.

974
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,881
The boy, he has been brought to you
many times.

975
00:51:55,882 --> 00:51:59,042
Yes, he was.
But I saw him unofficially.

976
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,722
I took no payment
and so there is no file.

977
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:05,721
You took no payment?

978
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,961
Well, not in the usual way.

979
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:12,401
I'm sorry, I do not understand.
She had no money, Poirot.

980
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:16,161
Look, self-control is not one
of my stronger qualities.

981
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,162
I just have to live with it.

982
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:22,441
I see.

983
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:25,281
But I only ask about the boy Desmond.

984
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:27,282
What was he like?

985
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:31,842
Remarkable power of recall.

986
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:36,241
The smallest details of his
childhood were easy to surface.

987
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:38,281
But lacking in self-confidence.

988
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:42,001
I believe that he had an interest
that was almost obsessional.

989
00:52:42,002 --> 00:52:45,361
In... I do not know who.
A woman or an older man?

990
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,441
A French woman, I believe.

991
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:49,481
Zazie. Susie.

992
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,841
She was 25 or so at the time
and he 15.

993
00:52:51,842 --> 00:52:56,242
Would you say he was in love?

994
00:52:57,722 --> 00:52:59,722
I would say so, yes.

995
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:04,362
Not that I know very much
about that particular emotion.

996
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:11,561
I've spoken to my god-daughter
Celia.

997
00:53:11,562 --> 00:53:14,481
Have you?
Oh, good. What did she say?

998
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:17,441
First, there's someone
I wish you to meet.

999
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:20,761
Mrs Burton-Cox,
this is Monsieur Poirot.

1000
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:23,762
Monsieur Poirot is... my assistant.

1001
00:53:26,362 --> 00:53:28,401
Enchante, madame.

1002
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:30,641
Is he French?
I can't stand the French.

1003
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:32,681
Non, madame. I am Belgian.

1004
00:53:32,682 --> 00:53:35,402
You have concerns about
the marriage of your son

1005
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:38,121
Desmond with Mademoiselle
Celia Ravenscroft.

1006
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:40,161
That is so.

1007
00:53:40,162 --> 00:53:43,521
Young people today,
they rush into things!

1008
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:46,922
But it's important to know
the background, don't you think?

1009
00:53:48,362 --> 00:53:50,401
The psychological background.

1010
00:53:50,402 --> 00:53:55,241
Well, there are certain... risks
that one might not wish to take.

1011
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:57,442
But the persons taking
these risks are

1012
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,641
Celia and Desmond,
not you, madame.

1013
00:53:59,642 --> 00:54:01,481
Beg your pardon?

1014
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,521
Desmond, he is not your son by birth.

1015
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:05,362
What's that got to do with anything?

1016
00:54:05,363 --> 00:54:07,401
When he was young,
did you take care of him?

1017
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:09,681
Of course I did! Mrs Oliver, I...

1018
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:12,841
You must have had some help.
Help? Why would I need help?

1019
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:15,201
I'm his mother!
Perhaps in the holidays.

1020
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:17,562
Oh... Yes, of course.
In the holidays, he

1021
00:54:17,563 --> 00:54:19,921
went to stay with some
people in Suffolk.

1022
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:22,202
And in Suffolk, he was in
the care of a French girl.

1023
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:24,482
Zelie. Zelie Rouxelle.

1024
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:29,281
I've had quite enough of this!

1025
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,321
Goodbye!

1026
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:34,722
What occurred between Desmond
and Zelie Rouxelle, madame?

1027
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:39,441
Do either of you have the faintest
idea what it's like?!

1028
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:43,681
When your own child takes one look
at you and starts to scream?

1029
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:45,802
And after a few months
with that beloved

1030
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:47,921
nanny, I could do
nothing with him!

1031
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:51,721
She's a...
She's a devious little baggage!

1032
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,401
And I made jolly sure to intercept
her letters later on.

1033
00:54:55,402 --> 00:54:58,402
He's my son and I will say
what happens to him!

1034
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:06,722
Ladies and gentlemen! Five minutes
till the start of the recital!

1035
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,681
Mademoiselle Celia. Poirot.

1036
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:15,321
Mademoiselle, do you know,
and please to forgive me,

1037
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:17,361
how it was that Aunt Dorothea died?

1038
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:20,281
Yes, I do. And your cousins.

1039
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:23,121
The little girl and the little boy
who was drowned?

1040
00:55:23,122 --> 00:55:25,122
We tended not to speak of them.

1041
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:28,362
But perhaps they were
also looked after

1042
00:55:28,363 --> 00:55:30,681
during the holidays by
your au pair Zelie.

1043
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:32,841
No, no. Zelie just had me
and Desmond.

1044
00:55:32,842 --> 00:55:35,681
But she returned to assist
your mother at the end.

1045
00:55:35,682 --> 00:55:39,401
And she also takes dictations from
your late father, does she not?

1046
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,441
Yes.

1047
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:42,522
So what was the
involvement of your late

1048
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:44,601
father with the
Willoughby Institute?

1049
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:48,561
What is the Willoughby Institute?
It was where your aunt was treated.

1050
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,601
I don't know anything at all.
I see.

1051
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:52,641
Um...

1052
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:56,241
Mademoiselle, please to think
very carefully.

1053
00:55:56,242 --> 00:56:00,561
Is it possible that there was
anyone else staying at Overcliff

1054
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:03,401
at the time of the deaths
of your parents?

1055
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:06,441
Anyone perhaps whom the police
did not know about.

1056
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:08,922
I don't know how because
if there had been,

1057
00:56:08,923 --> 00:56:11,401
Zelie would have mentioned
it, wouldn't she?

1058
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,441
Oui.

1059
00:56:13,442 --> 00:56:16,401
Have you remained in contact
with Zelie?

1060
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:19,841
I wrote to her countless times.
But all my letters were sent back.

1061
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,881
She simply disappeared.

1062
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:25,201
I'd love to have seen her.
She was a marvellous character.

1063
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:27,841
And Desmond, does he write to her?
How could he?

1064
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,881
We don't know where she lives.

1065
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:33,001
And you yourself, have you ever
returned to Overcliff?

1066
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:35,041
No.

1067
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:37,081
Why? Why, do you think I should?

1068
00:56:37,082 --> 00:56:39,401
Drive out my demons,
that sort of thing?

1069
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,441
Ladies and gentlemen!

1070
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:43,442
Please take your seats!

1071
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:50,841
Madame Oliver! I'm so sorry.

1072
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,881
They are seated. I'm so sorry.

1073
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:54,921
Is Celia there? Yes, she is.

1074
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:57,161
Good. That's very good.
No, monsieur!

1075
00:56:57,162 --> 00:56:59,201
Merci.

1076
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:01,761
The key, it is Zelie.
Of this I am sure.

1077
00:57:01,762 --> 00:57:03,762
But how do we find her?

1078
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,801
Miss Ravenscroft,
good of you to come.

1079
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,802
Look at all those diamonds!

1080
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:31,242
He's playing without music.
Clever chap.

1081
00:57:46,642 --> 00:57:48,662
CELIA: There was a foreign girl.
She'd

1082
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:50,681
be my governess
when I was young.

1083
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:52,721
She'd come back to help Mummy.

1084
00:57:52,722 --> 00:57:54,402
DESMOND: I'd formed
an attachment to

1085
00:57:54,403 --> 00:57:56,081
someone and I
wouldn't give it up.

1086
00:57:56,082 --> 00:57:57,842
MRS BURTON-COX:
After that beloved

1087
00:57:57,843 --> 00:57:59,601
nanny, I could do
nothing with him!

1088
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,761
CELIA: All my letters
were sent back.

1089
00:58:01,762 --> 00:58:03,762
She simply disappeared.

1090
00:58:17,682 --> 00:58:19,682
Very good.

1091
00:58:29,162 --> 00:58:31,881
How long is the interval?
That is it!

1092
00:58:31,882 --> 00:58:33,921
That is it!

1093
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:36,042
How could I be so stupid?!

1094
00:58:38,242 --> 00:58:40,242
Enjoying it, Ariadne?

1095
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:52,321
Please to forgive the intrusion,
monsieur.

1096
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:54,502
Poirot. I really can't
talk to you now

1097
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,681
. We're about to go on
for the second half.

1098
00:58:56,682 --> 00:58:58,742
Non! It will not be
possible for you

1099
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,802
to play the remainder
of this concert.

1100
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:06,281
Unless you give to me the address
of Mademoiselle Zelie Rouxelle.

1101
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:08,562
I don't know it.
Yes, you do know it.

1102
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,561
I can't remember it.
We have to go on.

1103
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:14,582
Monsieur, you play
Bach from memory.

1104
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,601
You have the memory
of an elephant.

1105
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:18,562
I demand to know the address of

1106
00:59:18,563 --> 00:59:20,521
Mademoiselle Zelie
Rouxelle, tout de suite!

1107
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:23,402
(KNOCKING)
Mr Burton-Cox! It's time, gentlemen!

1108
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,842
Merci, monsieur.

1109
00:59:47,402 --> 00:59:49,402
Taxi!

1110
00:59:50,242 --> 00:59:52,281
Mr Poirot!

1111
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:54,521
It's Bill Garroway.
Superintendent.

1112
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:58,241
This is Sprat. Wife named him that.

1113
00:59:58,242 --> 01:00:01,161
She died. I'm stuck with him!

1114
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:04,281
Oh, Inspector Beale
told me you'd be here.

1115
01:00:04,282 --> 01:00:06,321
Asked me to deliver this. Ah.

1116
01:00:06,322 --> 01:00:08,441
He's been called out on a case.
Merci.

1117
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:11,201
I am so sorry you have been put
to so much trouble.

1118
01:00:11,202 --> 01:00:13,721
No trouble at all, sir.
I bid you good night.

1119
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:15,761
Come on, Sprat!

1120
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,801
Superintendent.

1121
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:19,841
Tell to me about Sprat.

1122
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:21,881
Does he bite?

1123
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:24,281
He bites his own backside mainly.

1124
01:00:24,282 --> 01:00:26,321
Not exactly clever.

1125
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,002
And please to recollect,
the dog that lived with

1126
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:31,681
the General and Lady
Ravenscroft, did it bite?

1127
01:00:31,682 --> 01:00:34,201
It's a funny thing
you mentioned that, sir.

1128
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:36,762
The housekeeper said
the dog had turned

1129
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:39,321
on its mistress a
couple of days before.

1130
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:43,041
And sure enough, when we did
the autopsy on Lady Ravenscroft,

1131
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:47,041
there's a couple of dog bite marks
maybe a week or two old.

1132
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:49,442
So that dog, it was clever, huh?

1133
01:00:50,682 --> 01:00:51,721
Merci.

1134
01:00:51,722 --> 01:00:53,761
Taxi!

1135
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:55,801
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

1136
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,882
Paris! Whitehaven
Mansions and then

1137
01:00:57,883 --> 01:00:59,961
Victoria station for
the boat train!

1138
01:00:59,962 --> 01:01:01,962
Vite! Right you are, guvnor.

1139
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,320
(WHISTLE)

1140
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,199
I will be with you in one moment,
monsieur.

1141
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Merci.

1142
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
Hercules Poirot.

1143
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,640
Do I have the honour to address
Mademoiselle Zelie Rouxelle?

1144
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,960
As I said to you in my
telegram, I wish to ask

1145
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:32,519
you about the General and
the Lady Ravenscroft.

1146
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,839
I believe
that you are employed by them.

1147
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,719
Yes. I was an au pair for Celia.

1148
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,119
You knew also the boy Desmond.
Desmond Burton-Cox.

1149
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,400
Yes, we still correspond.
But you do so in secret, I think.

1150
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,719
His mother disapproves.

1151
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,959
There is nothing of which
to disapprove. We are friends.

1152
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,999
He and Celia intend to marry.

1153
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,799
He has told me.
I am pleased for them.

1154
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,359
But difficulties are being put
in their way.

1155
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,180
Mademoiselle Celia is being
asked to tell to the

1156
01:03:01,181 --> 01:03:03,999
Desmond family exactly what
happened at Overcliff.

1157
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,839
It is now since 13 years.
But she cannot do that.

1158
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,879
For she does not know.

1159
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,519
It was thought advisable
to tell her nothing.

1160
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,479
She accepted it.
She was too young to understand.

1161
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,519
She is old enough now to understand.

1162
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,959
But what is there to understand,
monsieur?

1163
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,999
It was a double suicide.

1164
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,439
And you have found no reason
to doubt that?

1165
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,640
The police found no reason
to doubt it.

1166
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,919
So there is nothing more you can
tell to me, Mademoiselle Rouxelle?

1167
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,959
I fear I cannot.

1168
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,960
It was a very long time ago.

1169
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,439
For how long were you living
at Overcliff before their deaths?

1170
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,399
For two months.
And the sister of Lady Ravenscroft,

1171
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,239
Dorothea Jarrow, she was also living
there at this time, was she not?

1172
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,400
How much do you know?

1173
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,679
It has to end. You understand that.

1174
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,719
Yeah.

1175
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,720
It always ends.

1176
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,159
I'm so sorry, my darling.

1177
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,199
Guys like you are always sorry.

1178
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,360
But guess what. I'll be OK.

1179
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,679
May I help you? Yes, thank you.

1180
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,680
I wonder if you can.

1181
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,600
I wanted to see if there
was anything in your files

1182
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,119
pertaining to the treatment
of Dorothea Jarrow.

1183
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,239
Can I ask what business this is
of yours?

1184
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,559
She was my aunt.
I'm Celia Ravenscroft.

1185
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,119
I think something funny is going on.
Sure.

1186
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,159
OK.

1187
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Why don't we take a look?

1188
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,039
Dorothea Jarrow had been treated
for the mental illness.

1189
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,559
But had shown some improvement,
n'est-ce pas?

1190
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,599
Yes.

1191
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,040
And it was so beneficial
for her to spend

1192
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,479
some time in a
normal family home.

1193
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,680
And Dorothea and Margaret,
they were fond of each other?

1194
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,320
There was a bond between them.

1195
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,680
A bond of dependence and love.

1196
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,040
And in many ways, they were alike.

1197
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,479
Pardon.

1198
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,960
But in twins, although
there is this bond of love...

1199
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,120
..if something should
occur to break

1200
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,559
it, then it is
shattered forever.

1201
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,560
Oh yes, I know.

1202
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,560
And love, it may easily turn to hate.

1203
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,920
And it is easier to
hate what you have

1204
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,080
once loved than to
remain indifferent.

1205
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
Do you speak from experience?

1206
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,520
Tell to me about Dorothea Jarrow.

1207
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,199
She lived in a state
of terrible strain.

1208
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,199
She had had some advanced therapy.

1209
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
But it seemed not to do much good.

1210
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
She was never happy.

1211
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,039
And she had a great aversion
to children.

1212
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,919
Oui. And that led to incidents
most serious, n'est-ce pas?

1213
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,900
I heard what happened
in her early life.

1214
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:15,879
I heard what happened in India.

1215
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,199
I have no first-hand knowledge
of that.

1216
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,220
No, but there are
events of which you

1217
01:06:20,221 --> 01:06:22,239
do have the
first-hand knowledge.

1218
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,180
Isn't it better to
leave things when

1219
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,120
at least they have
been accepted?

1220
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,879
Mademoiselle, what happened
on that day at Overcliff,

1221
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,439
it could have been a double suicide,
it could have been a murder,

1222
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,599
it could have been... one of
a number of possibilities.

1223
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,159
But from what you have just said,
from that one little sentence,

1224
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,160
I consider that you know
what happened on that day.

1225
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,120
And you know what happened
in the weeks before.

1226
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,919
I cannot tell you anything.

1227
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,920
I'm sorry.

1228
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,399
Was there someone else at Overcliff?

1229
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,759
Someone of whom
the police know nothing?

1230
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,760
No.

1231
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,799
I think that you lie.

1232
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,239
The General Ravenscroft was
at first in love with Dorothea.

1233
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,279
Then his affections, they change.

1234
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,599
And he marries her twin sister
Margaret.

1235
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,680
What do you suppose that
that has done to Dorothea?

1236
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,439
I suppose that it has
destroyed her, monsieur.

1237
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,479
And the general, he has realised.

1238
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,639
Yes. He knew.

1239
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,640
He had a good heart.

1240
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,759
And you were also in love with him,
I think.

1241
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,799
You may not speak to me like that.

1242
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,639
No, no, mademoiselle. I do not say
that you had a love affair.

1243
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,160
I say only that you loved him.

1244
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,120
One can love and serve
and still be happy.

1245
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,480
Even if one is not loved in return.

1246
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,080
You did serve him, mademoiselle.

1247
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,400
You served him loyally in the great
crisis of his life.

1248
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,159
Tell to me what happened.

1249
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,199
I know that you know.

1250
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,919
You pretended to the police that
you had only the little English.

1251
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,719
Then you left Overcliff at once.

1252
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,980
But you were there.
And I need you to

1253
01:08:23,981 --> 01:08:26,239
tell me who else
was in the house.

1254
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,279
Why should I tell you anything?

1255
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,280
My life ended that day.

1256
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,440
It was as if I had been shot.

1257
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,079
I have hidden myself away.

1258
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,919
Here, in a back street in Paris.
Look at me!

1259
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,959
I've had no life at all.

1260
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Why must I speak now?

1261
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,240
Because you have a heart, Zelie.

1262
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,080
And because Celia and Desmond,
they need to know.

1263
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,640
Mademoiselle, neither you nor I
are married.

1264
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,800
We may never be married.

1265
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,520
But they should be.

1266
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,359
I do hope you had a nice time
in Paris.

1267
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,079
I've been to the shipping office.
Here are the records you wanted.

1268
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
Merci, madame.

1269
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,359
Bon.

1270
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,680
And Poirot, he has also a document
for you.

1271
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,460
This is the deed of
covenant for the legacy

1272
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:55,760
left to Desmond by
his natural mother.

1273
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:02,199
The trust, it is to be administered
by Madame Burton-Cox

1274
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,319
and her solicitor as trustees...

1275
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,359
..until...

1276
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,920
(READS) Until he reaches
the age of 25 or

1277
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:13,479
until he marries,
whichever is the earlier.

1278
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,319
So if he marries Celia,
he'll come into a fortune.

1279
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
Oui.

1280
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,620
But how does this fit in
with Mrs Burton-Cox wanting

1281
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:25,399
to know about the deaths
of the Ravenscrofts?

1282
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,839
She is not concerned with the deaths
of the Ravenscrofts, non.

1283
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,399
Her sole concern
is to prevent the marriage.

1284
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,439
(BUZZER) Why?

1285
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,759
Because...

1286
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,980
She is stealing the
money of Desmond and

1287
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:39,199
needs to pay it back
before he notices.

1288
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,719
So if he marries Celia now...
Fin de partie.

1289
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,599
I say, excuse me! I've lost Celia.

1290
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,159
I'm worried. She said something
about going to Eastbourne.

1291
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,599
Exorcising ghosts
or some such nonsense.

1292
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,319
This was straight after she came
back from the Willoughby Institute.

1293
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,759
She has been
to the Willoughby Institute?

1294
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,799
Now she has gone to Eastbourne?

1295
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,000
Alors, she is in danger.
We must hurry!

1296
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
Hello.

1297
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,719
Excuse me.

1298
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,039
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

1299
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,079
Why are you...

1300
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,080
Aagh!

1301
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,839
Up there, sir! Ravenscroft!

1302
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,879
(WHISTLE) Miss Ravenscroft!

1303
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
Help! Help!

1304
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,839
Come on. It's all right.
We've got you.

1305
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,840
You're under arrest!

1306
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,120
All safe. All safe.

1307
01:13:03,202 --> 01:13:05,202
Monsieur, mademoiselle.

1308
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:08,602
The question to be put, it is this.

1309
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:16,241
Was the deaths of the Ravenscrofts
a suicide?

1310
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:18,281
Or was it murder?

1311
01:13:18,282 --> 01:13:22,122
Because one or the other
must be true.

1312
01:13:23,162 --> 01:13:26,401
But Poirot, he says to you

1313
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,441
that both are true.

1314
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:30,681
And I fear, Mademoiselle Celia,

1315
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:33,841
it is a tragedy of two people
who loved each other,

1316
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,842
and who died for love.

1317
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:39,441
And it will be hard for you to hear.

1318
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:41,442
I'm ready. Bon.

1319
01:13:44,722 --> 01:13:48,241
When Madame Oliver set out on
her visit to old acquaintances,

1320
01:13:48,242 --> 01:13:50,601
Poirot at first
seemed to take no notice.

1321
01:13:50,602 --> 01:13:52,762
Alors, he had another
case which seemed

1322
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:54,921
to him infinitely
more important.

1323
01:13:54,922 --> 01:13:57,041
For that, I apologise to you, Madame.

1324
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,881
For what you found out
in your visits into Sussex,

1325
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:02,601
it was vital
for the solving of both mysteries.

1326
01:14:02,602 --> 01:14:05,121
You know who killed
Professor Willoughby?

1327
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:07,161
I have my little theory.

1328
01:14:07,162 --> 01:14:09,201
But we shall see.

1329
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:11,522
When I learned that
everything, it was

1330
01:14:11,523 --> 01:14:13,841
pointing to the
Willoughby Institute,

1331
01:14:13,842 --> 01:14:17,201
I looked at the evidence in
the notebooks of Madame Oliver.

1332
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,202
The recollections of these...

1333
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:22,202
..elephants.

1334
01:14:23,122 --> 01:14:25,801
At first, they seemed
to have no value.

1335
01:14:25,802 --> 01:14:27,841
But everything has a value.

1336
01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:31,522
Everyone remembers something.

1337
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,721
And so I take from one informant
one detail, from another, another.

1338
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:41,001
And so we have first of all
the evidence of the wigs.

1339
01:14:41,002 --> 01:14:43,041
Wigs?

1340
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:48,241
Oui. We learned that Lady
Ravenscroft, she had four wigs.

1341
01:14:48,242 --> 01:14:52,161
Four! Now this, for Poirot,
was a puzzle, huh?

1342
01:14:52,162 --> 01:14:54,201
Thank you, Zelie.

1343
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:56,241
We know that, on the day
that she died,

1344
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,322
Lady Ravenscroft was
wearing the wig with the

1345
01:14:58,323 --> 01:15:00,401
curls of the colour of
the strawberry blonde.

1346
01:15:00,402 --> 01:15:03,641
Why is that significant? She might
have been wearing any of them.

1347
01:15:03,642 --> 01:15:06,001
Oui, but we also have the evidence
of the dog.

1348
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,561
Dog? What dog?
No. Please, be patient.

1349
01:15:09,562 --> 01:15:13,561
This dog, it is devoted
to its mistress.

1350
01:15:13,562 --> 01:15:15,601
But in the last few weeks of her
life,

1351
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:18,041
this dog, it has bitten her
more than once.

1352
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:20,762
You mean the dog knew
she would commit suicide?

1353
01:15:21,842 --> 01:15:24,321
Non, it is much more simple
than that.

1354
01:15:24,322 --> 01:15:26,841
This dog, it knew
what no-one else knew.

1355
01:15:26,842 --> 01:15:29,642
It knew that she was not
his mistress.

1356
01:15:31,762 --> 01:15:35,201
She looked like his mistress
in the clothes of Margaret.

1357
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:37,241
In the wig of Margaret.

1358
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:41,161
But a dog only recognises
what its nose tells to him.

1359
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,321
And this dog recognised
that this was not his mistress.

1360
01:15:44,322 --> 01:15:46,402
So who could it be, this woman?

1361
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:51,481
Could it be her twin sister Dorothea?

1362
01:15:51,482 --> 01:15:53,601
But that's impossible. She was dead.

1363
01:15:53,602 --> 01:15:55,962
But now I come to
something else that was

1364
01:15:55,963 --> 01:15:58,321
brought to my attention
by Madame Oliver.

1365
01:15:58,322 --> 01:16:00,782
The knowledge that
Lady Ravenscroft had

1366
01:16:00,783 --> 01:16:03,241
recently been in a hospital
or a nursing home.

1367
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:05,881
It is believed
that she suffered from cancer.

1368
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:08,102
This I learned from
the evidence of Julia

1369
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:10,321
Carstairs in your
notebook, madame.

1370
01:16:10,322 --> 01:16:13,041
So her visits to the hospital
pass unremarked.

1371
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:16,001
I don't think Julia Carstairs
knew what she was talking about!

1372
01:16:16,002 --> 01:16:19,561
It does not matter. Because the
General Alistair Ravenscroft,

1373
01:16:19,562 --> 01:16:22,401
once he rejects Dorothea
and marries her sister,

1374
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:24,521
Dorothea, she becomes very jealous.

1375
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:29,041
Her life, as you say,
it goes from the rails.

1376
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,362
And we have reason to
believe that one and

1377
01:16:31,363 --> 01:16:33,681
possibly two children
died at her hands.

1378
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:37,001
And the general, having the feelings
of guilt so terrible,

1379
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:40,441
pays for her to have treatment
at the Willoughby Institute.

1380
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:42,422
DESMOND: Are you
saying, sir, that

1381
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:44,401
the mad aunt shot
the Ravenscrofts?

1382
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:46,722
Non, monsieur.
That is not my solution.

1383
01:16:50,362 --> 01:16:54,162
Mademoiselle Celia, I hope you will
not be too dismayed by the truth.

1384
01:16:56,682 --> 01:16:59,722
It was Dorothea
who killed your mother.

1385
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:04,041
Often, they would go for a walk
together in the evenings.

1386
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,721
But one evening, she returned alone.

1387
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,761
She must have run off.
She doesn't run off, Dorothea!

1388
01:17:09,762 --> 01:17:12,362
She's my wife!
What have you done with her?

1389
01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:16,041
We should look. You're right.

1390
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:19,521
Where were you walking?
Where we always walk.

1391
01:17:19,522 --> 01:17:21,641
Something has happened to Margaret.

1392
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,642
Come on, Zelie!

1393
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,122
Lady Ravenscroft! Where are you?
Margaret!

1394
01:17:30,842 --> 01:17:32,881
Margaret!

1395
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:34,882
Margaret! (BARKING DOG)

1396
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:43,921
Margaret! Come on.

1397
01:17:43,922 --> 01:17:45,961
We'll take the cliff path.

1398
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,962
Margaret!

1399
01:17:50,002 --> 01:17:52,002
Margaret!

1400
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:56,361
Margaret, what happened?

1401
01:17:56,362 --> 01:17:58,401
Was it your sister?

1402
01:17:58,402 --> 01:18:00,721
It isn't her fault, Alistair.
Damn her!

1403
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:02,761
What did she do?

1404
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,762
She pushed me.

1405
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:08,362
She doesn't know what she's doing.

1406
01:18:09,762 --> 01:18:11,801
I know it's bad, Zelie.

1407
01:18:11,802 --> 01:18:13,841
I know I'll die. No.

1408
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:16,641
I'll get a doctor.
There's no time for a doctor.

1409
01:18:16,642 --> 01:18:18,682
Please don't let her suffer for it.

1410
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:22,361
Don't let them give her
that treatment again.

1411
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:25,281
Promise me, Alistair.
Promise me you'll save her.

1412
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,321
Zelie. Yes?

1413
01:18:27,322 --> 01:18:29,322
Make him do as I ask.

1414
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,961
I promise, Margaret.

1415
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:38,482
I promise.
Thank you, my darling.

1416
01:18:40,402 --> 01:18:42,402
Thank you.

1417
01:18:45,362 --> 01:18:47,401
Oh, Margaret.

1418
01:18:47,402 --> 01:18:49,441
Margaret!

1419
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:51,442
(CRIES)

1420
01:18:56,242 --> 01:18:58,281
Zelie wanted to go for help.

1421
01:18:58,282 --> 01:19:00,321
But the general, he said no.

1422
01:19:00,322 --> 01:19:03,522
'I made a promise. I must keep it.'

1423
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:06,842
He decided what he would do.

1424
01:19:08,602 --> 01:19:10,641
And he asked Zelie to help him.

1425
01:19:10,642 --> 01:19:12,642
Forgive me, my darling.

1426
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,522
Forgive me.

1427
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:40,721
Celia, are you all right?

1428
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:42,722
It's better to know.

1429
01:19:44,002 --> 01:19:46,041
Go on.

1430
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,081
They made a plan.

1431
01:19:48,082 --> 01:19:51,202
They agreed to say it was
Dorothea who walked in

1432
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:54,322
her sleep and fell to her
death, not Margaret.

1433
01:19:55,602 --> 01:19:58,241
They hid her in a cottage
for a week or ten days.

1434
01:19:58,242 --> 01:20:00,622
The General Ravenscroft
put it about that

1435
01:20:00,623 --> 01:20:03,001
his wife had suffered
a nervous collapse.

1436
01:20:03,002 --> 01:20:05,961
And was in a sanatorium, recovering.

1437
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:09,401
Zelie, she had gone to London
and bought wigs to fit Dorothea

1438
01:20:09,402 --> 01:20:11,841
from Eugene and Rosentelle
of Bond Street.

1439
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:13,842
Then they brought her back.

1440
01:20:16,242 --> 01:20:19,241
Good morning, Mrs Whittaker.
Have we something nice for lunch?

1441
01:20:19,242 --> 01:20:21,281
Yes, madam.

1442
01:20:21,282 --> 01:20:24,241
Everyone accepted that this
was Lady Ravenscroft.

1443
01:20:24,242 --> 01:20:26,561
And thought
that she was behaving oddly

1444
01:20:26,562 --> 01:20:28,222
because she was still
suffering from

1445
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,881
shock at the death
of her sister.

1446
01:20:29,882 --> 01:20:32,521
How could she keep it up?
It must have been difficult.

1447
01:20:32,522 --> 01:20:35,081
Non, madame. It was not difficult.

1448
01:20:35,082 --> 01:20:38,961
Because, at last, she had achieved
what she wanted.

1449
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:41,881
She was married to General
Alistair Ravenscroft.

1450
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:43,921
But how could my father bear it?

1451
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,601
As I said, he made a plan.

1452
01:20:47,602 --> 01:20:50,521
Zelie, today is your last day
of work.

1453
01:20:50,522 --> 01:20:53,001
I am sending you back to Paris.

1454
01:20:53,002 --> 01:20:55,041
You cannot do that.

1455
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:57,081
I can, my dear, and I will.

1456
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:59,442
You have given sterling
service but I do not

1457
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,801
want you mixed up in this.
Not any more.

1458
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:03,802
Enough is enough. (CRIES)

1459
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:07,602
There, there.

1460
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:12,162
Zelie.

1461
01:21:18,202 --> 01:21:20,241
Stop here.

1462
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,841
Hold this. Why?

1463
01:21:22,842 --> 01:21:24,842
Because I want to kiss you.

1464
01:21:31,602 --> 01:21:33,961
Goodbye, Dorothea.
Where are you going?

1465
01:21:33,962 --> 01:21:36,001
Hell, I expect.

1466
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:38,041
This is for Margaret.

1467
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:40,042
(SHOT)

1468
01:21:43,922 --> 01:21:45,961
And this is for me.

1469
01:21:45,962 --> 01:21:47,962
(SHOT)

1470
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:53,562
(BARKING)

1471
01:21:56,362 --> 01:21:59,082
He had to keep his promise
to his wife.

1472
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:02,162
And he did.

1473
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:05,482
I am so sorry, Mademoiselle Celia.

1474
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,882
Bring her in.

1475
01:22:24,002 --> 01:22:26,681
Just who are you?
And why did you try to kill me?

1476
01:22:26,682 --> 01:22:28,682
Please to take off her cap.

1477
01:22:31,442 --> 01:22:33,442
This is Marie Jarrow.

1478
01:22:35,002 --> 01:22:37,002
The daughter of your aunt Dorothea.

1479
01:22:38,282 --> 01:22:41,081
You're my cousin?
How did you work it out, Poirot?

1480
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,161
The Boston-Irish, mademoiselle.

1481
01:22:43,162 --> 01:22:46,041
They venerate the 17th of March.

1482
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:49,001
St Patrick's Day.
Oui. There is always a big parade.

1483
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:52,122
Everyone knows what they were doing
on the 17th of March.

1484
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:55,281
Also, your accent, mademoiselle.

1485
01:22:55,282 --> 01:22:57,961
If you are from Boston,
as you say that you are,

1486
01:22:57,962 --> 01:23:00,001
in the state of Massachusetts,

1487
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:02,482
then you would pronounce
the last letter of

1488
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:04,961
the alphabet zee, but
you pronounced it zed.

1489
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:07,001
You are Canadian, mademoiselle.

1490
01:23:07,002 --> 01:23:10,081
And Poirot, he has heard this
immediately.

1491
01:23:10,082 --> 01:23:13,001
Also, you say that you arrived here
on the SS France.

1492
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:16,961
But non, Poirot, he has examined
the list of passengers.

1493
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:20,921
And there is no Marie McDermott
on the France.

1494
01:23:20,922 --> 01:23:22,961
But there is a Marie Jarrow.

1495
01:23:22,962 --> 01:23:25,282
Your mother killed mine!
Celia! Please!

1496
01:23:28,362 --> 01:23:31,001
And it is you, Mademoiselle Jarrow,

1497
01:23:31,002 --> 01:23:33,001
who killed Professor Willoughby.

1498
01:23:33,002 --> 01:23:36,481
He deserved it. Did you see
what they did to her?

1499
01:23:36,482 --> 01:23:39,081
Those appalling machines?
No wonder she went crazy.

1500
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:41,721
But how did you know?
She was long gone.

1501
01:23:41,722 --> 01:23:44,082
When I was at school,
she sent me letters.

1502
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:47,241
I still got them.

1503
01:23:47,242 --> 01:23:49,281
She told me what they did to her.

1504
01:23:49,282 --> 01:23:52,162
She knew I was too young
to understand.

1505
01:23:53,322 --> 01:23:56,802
But one day, I would understand.

1506
01:23:58,082 --> 01:24:01,081
And one day, I'd come back.

1507
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:03,161
Why have you waited so long?

1508
01:24:03,162 --> 01:24:05,601
I had no money.
I was just a poor secretary.

1509
01:24:05,602 --> 01:24:07,721
I had to earn enough
to get to England.

1510
01:24:07,722 --> 01:24:10,601
Where you take a job
at the Willoughby Institute.

1511
01:24:10,602 --> 01:24:12,641
To be honest, it was too easy.

1512
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:15,881
I knew the professor
came to work late at night.

1513
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:19,841
So I crawl into David's bed.

1514
01:24:19,842 --> 01:24:22,362
And he likes a little sleep
after pleasure.

1515
01:24:24,242 --> 01:24:27,361
His little sleeps
turn into longer sleeps.

1516
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,561
It was very clever, that.

1517
01:24:29,562 --> 01:24:32,601
To pretend to provide an alibi
for the Dr Willoughby.

1518
01:24:32,602 --> 01:24:35,921
Whereas, in fact, you were providing
an alibi for yourself.

1519
01:24:35,922 --> 01:24:38,801
That is clever.
Cleverer than you think, madame.

1520
01:24:38,802 --> 01:24:41,961
Then she goes to Jacqueline,
the wife of Dr Willoughby,

1521
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:44,001
and confesses her affair.

1522
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:47,361
So that this wife will not provide
the alibi for her husband.

1523
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:51,001
Meanwhile, she has become friendly
with Professor Willoughby.

1524
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,561
No doubt you take a great interest
in his work.

1525
01:24:53,562 --> 01:24:55,601
I told him I was writing a book.

1526
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:58,122
I told him the Willoughby
Institute was going

1527
01:24:58,123 --> 01:25:00,641
to go down big in the
history of psychiatry.

1528
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:05,801
And then you persuade the professor
to show to you the hydro room.

1529
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:07,841
You hit him.

1530
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:09,881
You gag him.

1531
01:25:09,882 --> 01:25:11,921
And then you drown him.

1532
01:25:11,922 --> 01:25:13,961
Also, mademoiselle,

1533
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:16,481
I know that on the day
that your mother died,

1534
01:25:16,482 --> 01:25:18,521
you were here at Overcliff.

1535
01:25:18,522 --> 01:25:20,561
You don't know that, Poirot.

1536
01:25:20,562 --> 01:25:22,601
Mais oui, mademoiselle.

1537
01:25:22,602 --> 01:25:24,602
Attendez.

1538
01:25:29,202 --> 01:25:31,202
Here is my proof.

1539
01:25:34,522 --> 01:25:36,522
Ohh. Zelie!

1540
01:25:41,722 --> 01:25:43,761
Oh, my children.

1541
01:25:43,762 --> 01:25:45,801
I was listening.

1542
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:48,321
I have heard everything
that was said.

1543
01:25:48,322 --> 01:25:50,681
You know it is true, Marie.

1544
01:25:50,682 --> 01:25:52,961
You were here.
Your mother sent for you.

1545
01:25:52,962 --> 01:25:56,242
You arrived the day she died.

1546
01:25:57,882 --> 01:25:59,921
You do remember.

1547
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:02,761
You arrived just in time
to hear this.

1548
01:26:02,762 --> 01:26:04,762
What are you going to do?

1549
01:26:06,802 --> 01:26:08,802
I am going to shoot her.

1550
01:26:10,322 --> 01:26:12,362
And then I'm going to shoot myself.

1551
01:26:15,602 --> 01:26:18,022
You know what? I have
this overpowering

1552
01:26:18,023 --> 01:26:20,442
feeling that that's
against the law.

1553
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,282
Just shooting someone.
Just killing them.

1554
01:26:25,762 --> 01:26:28,441
If I could have killed him
over again, I would!

1555
01:26:28,442 --> 01:26:30,481
Was it you who tried to strangle me?

1556
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:32,521
All I wanted was to punish her.

1557
01:26:32,522 --> 01:26:34,521
Ruin her.

1558
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,562
Why should her life be happy?

1559
01:26:39,122 --> 01:26:41,122
Mine wasn't.

1560
01:26:42,242 --> 01:26:44,321
Mademoiselle Rouxelle.

1561
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:46,502
As soon as I knew what
the general was about

1562
01:26:46,503 --> 01:26:48,681
to do, I took Marie
away very quickly.

1563
01:26:48,682 --> 01:26:51,681
I thought her life would be
intolerable if she stayed.

1564
01:26:51,682 --> 01:26:55,041
I sent her to relations of mine
in Montreal. I told no-one.

1565
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:57,041
And I returned to Paris.

1566
01:26:57,042 --> 01:26:59,922
I swore I would never speak of this.

1567
01:27:01,402 --> 01:27:05,041
I have broken my vow.
Forgive me, Marie.

1568
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:08,122
Non, mademoiselle.
You have done the right thing.

1569
01:27:10,322 --> 01:27:12,322
Please to take her away.

1570
01:27:28,482 --> 01:27:31,322
Desmond? Desmond, where are you?

1571
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:35,601
Desmond! If you're with that girl,
I'll skin you alive!

1572
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:38,842
Ah, there you are.
Come home at once!

1573
01:27:46,242 --> 01:27:49,962
I hope you do not blame me,
mademoiselle, for asking for your help.

1574
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,282
Non, monsieur. I am glad.

1575
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:58,121
Look.

1576
01:27:58,122 --> 01:28:00,122
Now they will have their future.

1577
01:28:16,522 --> 01:28:18,601
You and I are elephants, you know.

1578
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:21,601
We're good at remembering.
Non, non, madame.

1579
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:23,681
We are the human beings.

1580
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:28,082
And human beings, mercifully,
they can forget.

1581
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:42,082
