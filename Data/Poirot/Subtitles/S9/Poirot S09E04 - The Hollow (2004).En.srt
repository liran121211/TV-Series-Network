1
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,535
Hello, darling.
Managed to slip away,

2
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:58,374
but I think I sprang my bloody wrist.

3
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,489
Oh, John...

4
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,919
How is work?

5
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:27,874
<i>Fine, thanks. I'm doing a big
abstract to the International Exhibition.</i>

6
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,093
How's yours?

7
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:33,991
I might be making some progress
in the Ridgeway's Disease.

8
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,896
I've a patient in Hammersmith
Hospital, Mrs. Crabtree,

9
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,861
she's a driver's wife, I believe,

10
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,272
she's dying of Ridgeway's.

11
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:45,537
But she's allowed me to try
some new treatments on her.

12
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,137
By God, she's got some spirit!

13
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,614
Poor, frightened old thing that she is.

14
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,842
And all I get from Gerda is,
"Why are you out so late?"

15
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,501
Well, sometimes you're with me.

16
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,822
Hmm, but all the time I'm married
to Gerda.

17
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:08,338
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

18
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:13,977
Yes.
Will I see you this weekend?

19
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:17,332
- Yes. Are you going?
- Yes.

20
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,916
- Well, that will be lovely.
- Yes. Henrietta, come here.

21
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:35,695
<i>It's going to be a complete disaster.</i>

22
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:38,058
It's always the same
when I invite Gerda.

23
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,659
I wish I hadn't,

24
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:43,733
but the worst thing is that
she's so terribly nice.

25
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,018
One has to have her, of course,

26
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,655
it would be so terribly rude
to invite John without her.

27
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:54,135
On the other hand,
it does seem so odd, doen't it?

28
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,984
Someone as nice as Gerda should be
so voyd of any kind of intelligence.

29
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:05,661
I often think, if she had any spirit
at all, she'd stay away.

30
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,737
Henrietta will help, of course.

31
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,733
Strange how good Henrietta
is with Gerda.

32
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,663
- What're you talking about, Lucy?
- The weekend is upon us, Midge.

33
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:17,701
The guests will be arriving
any minute.

34
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,417
And I'm just trusting to Henrietta
to make conversation,

35
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:23,422
because John and Gerda...

36
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,298
... it's a nightmare,
John and Gerda.

37
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:29,142
Lucy, do you know what time it is?

38
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:33,417
I'm sorry, darling,
I have absolutely no idea what time it is.

39
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,145
It's a quarter past six!

40
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,504
Midge, I am sorry!
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:43,542
Come, come, come,
go back to your dreams. Good night.

44
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,092
Are you alright?

45
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:18,812
I'm tired.

46
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:20,531
A weekend in the country
will make you feel better.

47
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,541
Yes. Unfortunately,
Gerda is driving.

48
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:42,897
- Victor!
- Mr. Poirot, sir, have a good trip?

49
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,251
Without incident,
thank you. Victor,

50
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,878
Victor, what is that smell?
- Smell?

51
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,749
Can't smell anything, sir.
Just good country air.

52
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,397
Collie, the telephone number
is on the pad, in the surgery.

53
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:08,659
Call me if there's trouble.

54
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,899
There'll be no trouble,
Dr. Christow.

55
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,735
- Goodbye, children.
- Bye, daddy!

56
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,692
Be good!

57
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,135
It won't start.

58
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:23,725
Switch on the ignition, Gerda!

59
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,731
- I'm so stupid. I'm sorry.
- Let's just get there, shall we?

60
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,658
I wish we could stay at home.
The Angkatell frighten the life out of me.

61
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,815
- Goodbye, children!
- Bye mummy. Bye daddy!

62
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,070
The weather's said fair
for the weekend.

63
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,529
Everything's spick and span
(immaculate) at the cottage,

64
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,536
the wife's seen to that.

65
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,675
I am sure I shall be
most comfortable.

66
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:10,067
It will be a relief, I expect, escape
the fumes and stink of London.

67
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:16,579
I say!

68
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:19,618
<i>Milles tonnerres!</i>

69
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:26,423
Why must you spent so many hours
at the hospital

70
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:28,417
when you've a perfectly surgery
at home?

71
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,982
<i>It's research, Gerda!
Research, as I've explained before.</i>

72
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:37,371
- Why are you slowing?
- It might be about to turn red.

73
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,655
- But it isn't, is it? It's green.
- Oh! Sorry...

74
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,295
I just become convinced
it'd suddenly...

75
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,632
Oh, God, Gerda!

76
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,705
Gudgeon!

77
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:18,618
Hello, Midge!
Great to see you!

78
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,896
- What a gorgeous car!
- He's a Legonda.

79
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,650
Goes like the wind!

80
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,012
Thank you, Gudgeon.

81
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,069
- Hello, Lucy.
- Henrietta!

82
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,015
Wonderful to see you.

83
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:34,613
I supose that, by the time you take
that magificent steed of yours to the stable,

84
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,132
give it a rub down and a nosebag,

85
00:08:37,305 --> 00:08:38,707
lunch might be ready.

86
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,904
- Who's coming?
- The Christow.

87
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:45,654
- And Edward's arriving after lunch.
- Good.

88
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,719
Looks like you'll have some company,
Mr. Poirot.

89
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:54,338
Someone has taken
the cottage next door.

90
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,516
Mr. Poirot!

91
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,641
<i>Enchanté, Madame.</i>

92
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:09,896
Everything is beautiful,
as usual.

93
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,573
But tell me, someone has taken up
residence at Dovecotes?

94
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:14,472
Yes, sir. A lady.

95
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,140
An actrice, they say.

96
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,218
How's the dreaded dress shop?

97
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,548
Bloody awful!

98
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:39,905
- Hello there!
- Edward!

99
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,265
Hello, Midge!

100
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:43,979
Hello, Henrietta!

101
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,542
But tell me, Madame Simms,
what is this?

102
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,495
I did not expect any mail
to this address.

103
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,090
It's from Lady Angkatell,
up at The Hollow.

104
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,266
<i>Pour ce soir?</i>

105
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,979
How are things at Ainswick,
Edward? Just as lovely as ever?

106
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,119
Why don't you come and see?

107
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:31,684
You're always welcome.

108
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,403
Anytime.

109
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,386
Anytime at all.

110
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,811
You are sweet.

111
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,157
And Ainswick is the best place
in the world.

112
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,711
Do you remember our special tree?

113
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,334
Igdrasil. The secret sign
we used to draw everywhere?

114
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,370
Fancy a breath here?

115
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:02,619
My God! Igdrasil.
Who drew that?

116
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,533
You did.

117
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,657
So, what've you been doing,
since I saw you last?

118
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:22,975
Nothing.

119
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,216
That sounds... peaceful.

120
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,091
You could find peace

121
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,034
at Ainswick, with me.

122
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:38,858
I wish I wasn't so dreadfully
fond of you, Edward.

123
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:43,613
Makes it so much harder to go on
saying " no".

124
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:49,667
What you really mean is that you won't
marry me because of John Christow.

125
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,784
- Why doesn't the fellow get a divorce?
- Because...

126
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,156
That's it, isn't it?

127
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,349
If there'd be no John Christow
in the world,

128
00:11:58,506 --> 00:11:59,904
you'd marry me.

129
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,042
<i>I used to spent my holidays
with Edward, at Ainswick.</i>

130
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,155
<i>It seemed so vast.</i>

131
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:14,358
14.000 acres, is bound to be vast, Midge.
Oh, how I miss it!

132
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,575
- Why didn't you inherit it, Lucy?
- Midge,

133
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:20,787
you know very well girls don't inherit.
It's the way the world wags.

134
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:24,816
Edward isn't even my cousin,
he's family's second cousin.

135
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:26,533
But he's still in tail.

136
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,747
Ainswick falls like rain,
right plop in his lap.

137
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:33,214
- Aren't you remotely bitter about that?
- No, of course not.

138
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,250
I've invited that crime fellow
for dinner.

139
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,838
I'm sorry?

140
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,132
That's why I was in your bedroom
so early, this morning.

141
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,060
I had this premonition, you see.

142
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,066
That we were to have
terrible foughts, for dinner.

143
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,618
So, him being here,
just could be a distraction.

144
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,697
What crime man, Lucy?

145
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,735
He was in Bagdad
when Henry was High-Comissionary.

146
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:55,504
He stays in one of those funny little cottages,
down the lane.

147
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:58,814
I remember he wore this pink
flower on his button hole

148
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,625
and he was solving something,
I can't quite remember what.

149
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:06,737
But of course I'm not terribly interested
on who killed whom.

150
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,577
I mean, once you're dead,
you're dead

151
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,652
it doesn't matter why, does it?

152
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,265
I'm no good in anything.

153
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,667
I don't know why you ever married me.

154
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,181
You needed taking care of,
that's why I married you.

155
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:27,029
I try to be a good wife, John.

156
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,523
This may not be
the best time to tell you...

157
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,099
You know I love you, don't you?

158
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,501
Of course I know,
but I have to warn you...

159
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:36,013
No one else, just you.

160
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:39,040
We'll never make it
to Shovel Down in third.

161
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,177
Very fair shooting, Edward.

162
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,637
Now, there.
Your turn, Henrietta.

163
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:22,253
See if you can kill
a burglar.

164
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,574
- Well done!
- No, you only winged him.

165
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,410
Hello, everyone! Hello, Henry!

166
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,537
- It's the Christow!
- Hello. So sorry we're late.

167
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,488
Not at all, not at all, just in time
for sporting target practice.

168
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,170
Nice to see you, John.
Now then, Gerda, come along.

169
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:43,062
- Try to put one in bullseye.

170
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,848
<i>I've never tried.</i>

171
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,372
- Hello, darling.
- Darling.

172
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:48,533
- I think you may have met Midge Hardcastle?
- Yes, of course.

173
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,891
And of course you know my
second cousin, Edward.

174
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,623
- How do you do, Edward?
- Hello, John.

175
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,378
<i>- What's going on?
- Henry's brought the artillery.</i>

176
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:56,853
Has he indeed?

177
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,243
I sprang my bloody wrist.

178
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,142
Careful.

179
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,708
Did I miss? I bet I missed.

180
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,822
My turn, is it?

181
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,957
Gerda, how lovely to see you!

182
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,255
Thank you, Henry.

183
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,648
Come along, Gudgeon.

184
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,608
I say, Lucy!

185
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,497
That's nothing. Once,
on the Asian side of the Bosphorus,

186
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,220
I was jumped by a couple of thugs.

187
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:45,187
We were rolling about in the dirt, we were.
Then, before I knew it,

188
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:47,731
she'd shot one in the leg
and one in stomach.

189
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:49,906
How she didn't hit me,
God alone knows!

190
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:51,578
It's quite simple!

191
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:55,173
You do it very quickly
and you don't think about it, Henry.

192
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:01,807
Sena has in ballet class.
Point shoes, the whole lot.

193
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,781
- And Terence?
- Chemistry.

194
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,868
Always trying to blow things up.

195
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,255
He's planning to make nitroglycerine
while were away.

196
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,095
- But don't tell John anything.
- Oh, I shan't.

197
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:16,260
- And you?
- Oh, I've taken up Leathercraft.

198
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:19,265
Do you like this?

199
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:20,683
I made it.

200
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,405
It's so nice talking to you.

201
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,692
But I suppose it will soon
be time for dinner.

202
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,721
Gerda...

203
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:34,645
... why do you come here
if you hate it so much?

204
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,321
I want John to be happy.

205
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,134
- He could come without you.
- No, he wouldn't like that.

206
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:44,618
He wouldn't enjoy it without me.
He said so.

207
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,983
<i>John is overly unselfish.</i>

208
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,808
I'd rather stay in Harley Street,
to be frank,

209
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:54,031
but he thinks it is good for me,
to get out into the country.

210
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:55,954
Oh, the country's alright.

211
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,379
No need to throw in the Angkatells

212
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:03,249
We're an odious family.
Come on, let's go in and get changed.

213
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,627
There's some sort of detective
coming in, apparently.

214
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:14,219
You wouldn't believe it.

215
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,612
Monsieur Poirot has habilities

216
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,615
one has to say,
quite phenomenal.

217
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:20,203
It's absolutely true, the talk about
there was in Bagdad.

218
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:23,178
Monsieur Poirot
and his little "green" cells.

219
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,115
Grey, Madame.

220
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:29,661
Pardon me. But we're awfully lucky
to have him as a neighbour.

221
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,930
I mean, in case anything went wrong.

222
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,165
Would you give it all up
if  I asked you to?

223
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,202
And come and live with me?

224
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,457
No.

225
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:58,902
No?

226
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,517
It's not really what you want.

227
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:05,261
Couldn't you lie to me,
just once?

228
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,773
- Why?
- Because I love you, Henrietta.

229
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:12,343
But you're so... damn it all,
so detached.

230
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,028
Your art, your cars,
your friends.

231
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,935
I want you to think
you only need me.

232
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,820
Isn't that what Gerda does?

233
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,332
Don't you tell me you care a damn
about Gerda.

234
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,748
Why not?

235
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,533
I like Gerda.

236
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,884
- Dinner, Milady.
- Thank you, Gudgeon

237
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,266
Please, Monsieur Poirot.
Come this way.

238
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>Merci.</i>

239
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:44,384
Has anyone seen John?

240
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:51,524
Well, the customers are awful!

241
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:53,143
One has to put up far more insolence

242
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:54,624
in a dress shop
than Gudgeon

243
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,932
or Simmons or any decent
domestic does here.

244
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,173
It must be absolute hell, darling.

245
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,850
But why does one has
to be so proud?

246
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,373
Anyone having to earn one's living,
doesn't have to be the end, has it?

247
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,932
It's all about self-esteem,
surely?

248
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:10,826
You're the expert on that.

249
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,719
So, how do you do it then,
Monsieur Poirot?

250
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:21,174
I beg your pardon, <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

251
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,141
To solve so many crimes?

252
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,327
Merely I use the process
of the thought logic

253
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,900
and once the process
it has been applied,

254
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,205
alors, the mistery
becomes <i>éclairé</i>

255
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,360
<i>and the criminal mind
it is uncovered.</i>

256
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:41,859
But that assumes that you're
cleverer than the criminal, doesn't it?

257
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,344
I am not sure that it does, Mademoiselle.
Logically.

258
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,583
Oh, I think it does.

259
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,904
What happens if you come across one
who's cleverer than yourself?

260
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:55,016
This is not the highest probability,
<i>Mademoiselle</i>.

261
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,859
Have you ever been to Deauville,
<i>Monsieur...?

262
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:01,951
Careful, sir. Henrietta
has a very sharp tongue.

263
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,867
After dinner, we use to
play games. Perhaps charades.

264
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,291
But tonight I think it would be
most appropriate,

265
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,692
<i>if we were to essay
the Murder Game.</i>

266
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:22,758
Lucy, don't you think Monsieur Poirot
would be rather bored...

267
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,547
Someone has to pretend to be dead.
Murdered.

268
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:29,219
And then we all have to find out
who did it. It's such fun!

269
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:31,650
It usually turns out to be Gudgeon.

270
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,387
Lady Angkatell,
it's a proposition that is most delightful,

271
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,457
but I'm one who retires early to his bed.

272
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,210
Your dinner, it was superb.

273
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,424
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

274
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,657
I hope that we shall resume
our conversation at another time.

275
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:49,019
I'd like that, <i>Monsieur Poirot.

276
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,291
- Sir Henry.
- Mr. Poirot.

277
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,650
An evening that was most delightful.

278
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,013
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,542
I know!
You must come to lunch tomorrow.

280
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,164
Oh, yes! He must, mustn't he?

281
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,977
<i>Pardon,</i>
but tomorrow I am <i>engagé.</i>

282
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:07,443
Nonsense, there's absolutely
nothing to do around here,

283
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:09,579
for miles and miles and miles.

284
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:12,907
I insist you come to our sunday
lunch.

285
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,155
Henry, tell him

286
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,429
I do not take kindly to being disobeyed.

287
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,232
We'd be very pleased to have you, old man.

288
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:24,214
<i>Et bien.</i>
It will be my pleasure to attend.

289
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,812
Thank you.

290
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,385
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

291
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:28,547
Good night, Mr. Poirot.

292
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,938
- Good night.
- Good night.

293
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,150
Ace of diamonds.

294
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,940
Why on earth did you lead
that diamond, Gerda?

295
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,330
Oh! I... was it wrong?

296
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,852
Don't be absurd,
she had to lead the diamond.

297
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,623
The only sane thing to do.

298
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:01,452
Game and rubber. Well done.

299
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,624
- Wait, did we win?
- A lucky finesse!

300
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,585
- You cheated.
- Was it obvious?

301
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:25,302
So that Gerda would win.

302
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,498
Honesty means nothing to you,
does it?

303
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:32,941
Good evening!

304
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:37,700
- Who the devil are you?
- Veronica Cray, Sir Henry.

305
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,818
Please, please, forgiving me for
barging in upon you like this.

306
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:42,866
I'm the dinky little house,
up the lane

307
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,901
and I've had the most frightful
catastrophe.

308
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:48,541
Please, come on in.
Henry, close the window.

309
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,377
What happened?

310
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:55,619
I've run out of matches.
On a Saturday night!

311
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,187
And I smoke like a chimney... truly.

312
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:01,075
I feel a complete fool,
but there's not a match in Dovecotes

313
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,709
so I've come to beg some from my
only neighbours within miles and...

314
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:09,805
- My God!
- Hello, Veronica.

315
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,298
My God, it's John Christow!

316
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:16,576
Matches, was it?

317
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:19,258
<i>This is too, too extraordinary!</i>

318
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:21,063
- Do you know each other?
- We did...

319
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:25,057
... a long time ago.
- Yes, John's an old friend.

320
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,304
<i>He was the first guy
I was ever in love with.</i>

321
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,936
Midge, would you kindly ring the bell?

322
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,746
I thought you were just wonderful!

323
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,974
<i>Weren't we really madly
in love?</i>

324
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:39,545
Veronica, this is my wife.

325
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:43,455
How lovely to meet you.

326
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:46,979
Ah, Gudgeon,

327
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:49,457
tell me, do we have plenty of matches
in the house?

328
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:52,372
<i>- A dozen boxes came today, milady.
- Excellent.</i>

329
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,219
- Would you kindly get six?
- Very good, milady.

330
00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:00,337
And... how do you like Dovecotes?

331
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:04,211
Oh, I adore it! It's so cute
and so close to London...

332
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,611
And, yet, we feel
so gloriously isolated.

333
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:12,001
We kindda lost touch
when I went to California, didn't we?

334
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:15,533
- You've been to California?
- Oh, I live there, actually.

335
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,457
I just popped over to do a little play.

336
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,669
One has to keep up to hand,

337
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,094
and say hello to
Shaftesbury Avenue and all that.

338
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,898
My dear Lady Angkatell,
I surely won't need all these.

339
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,624
We have plenty in the house.

340
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:32,158
Besides, I always think
it's rather tiresome

341
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:33,385
only having one of a thing, don't you?

342
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,065
This is very kind
of you, thank you.

343
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:39,501
Will you see me back to my cottage?

344
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:43,102
I want dreadfully to know
what you've been up to

345
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,338
in all those years and years,
since I've seen you.

346
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:50,320
I'm so sorry to have bothered you
in this pathetic way, Lady Angkatell,

347
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:52,904
- Night, night.
- Good night.

348
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,177
- That was Veronica Cray!
- Indeed.

349
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,936
We must catch up
one of her pictures, Henry.

350
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:19,174
If that little performance is anything
to go by,

351
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:22,186
we will certainly get our money's worth.

352
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:28,337
- I assure it's true
- It can't be!

353
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,624
- I'm not joking...
- No, it's not true!

354
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:33,253
It is true.

355
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,856
Come on, John. Come on.

356
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:50,177
What time is it?

357
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:53,892
Uh... I've-- I've no idea.

358
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:57,093
Sorry to wake you.

359
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:02,176
I had to go in for a drink
with the woman.

360
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,939
Good night, John.

361
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,648
Good night.

362
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,283
Morning.

363
00:28:22,394 --> 00:28:24,146
- Morning.
- Morning.

364
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,381
We're shooting after breakfast.

365
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:31,148
- We might bag a few pigeon.
- You wanna come?

366
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:34,092
No, thanks.

367
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,617
I feel a bit shattered,
to be honest.

368
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:49,231
For me?

369
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,140
It came this morning, sir.

370
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,555
We have to talk about our future.

371
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:17,067
I'm sorry?

372
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:21,121
Our future, John!
We've wasted 12 years.

373
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,869
I'm not going back to the States.

374
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,707
I'm going to make my life here,
with you.

375
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,911
You've this...

376
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,493
... you've got this
taped out all wrong.

377
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,785
We had quite a time together,
last night, but Veronica, you know

378
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,974
our lives are completely
divergent.

379
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,891
I mean, when we split up,
12 years ago,

380
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:50,497
well,... that was just it.
We split up.

381
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,613
<i>We didn't split up.
You ditched me.</i>

382
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,179
<i>I was your fiancée
and you ditched me!</i>

383
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:58,613
I couldn't go with you to Hollywood.

384
00:30:58,784 --> 00:30:59,999
I had to finish Med School.

385
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,499
Of course, to being a doctor.

386
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:04,062
<i>Well, you go on being a doctor,
I don't mind.</i>

387
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:07,815
My dear girl, I'm married.
I have children!

388
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,480
I know.

389
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:13,928
I'm married myself,
at the moment.

390
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:17,895
It's nothing a good divorce lawyer
can't fix.

391
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,615
John...
I always did want to be your wife.

392
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,550
<i>You see, I have this passion,</i>

393
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:28,496
<i>this overpowering passion!</i>

394
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,389
- We have to be together.
- No.

395
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:32,694
That is not going to happen!

396
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,419
- But last night...
- Last night...?

397
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:38,354
Look, you're not a child!

398
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:40,565
Last night was a one off.

399
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:45,577
Are you saying you don't love me?

400
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:50,082
You are a very,
very alluring woman, Veronica,

401
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:53,188
but I don't...
love you, no.

402
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,298
I came all this way to find you!

403
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:00,089
Waited in this ghastly hovel (hut)

404
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:02,140
for the weekend
for you to be here!

405
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:03,871
You see I knew...

406
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,583
... that if we could be,
just once more, together,

407
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,621
... just once more

408
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:10,883
You-- you planned it?

409
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:14,246
You belong to me, John.
You're mine!

410
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,163
When I was young man,

411
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,617
I wanted to share my life with you
and you wouldn't do it.

412
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,608
Because my career is so much more
important than yours.

413
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,745
Anyone can be a doctor.

414
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:28,857
You're a nasty piece of work!

415
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:32,855
<i>You leave me again,
I'll really make you sorry!</i>

416
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:34,957
So be it!

417
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,513
Goodbye.

418
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,940
I hate you more than I thought
I could hate anyone!

419
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,299
Good day, sir.

420
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:09,817
<i>Lady Angkatell would like you
to come to the pavillion, sir,</i>

421
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,418
for a glass of cherry.

422
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,291
- Out of doors?
- Would you care to follow me, sir?

423
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,891
<i>Merci.</i>

424
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:37,781
Milady?

425
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:47,226
I see that you are playing
the "Murder Game".

426
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:50,023
<i>Alors, très bien.</i>

427
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:52,227
I congratulate you all.

428
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:15,384
Henrietta...

429
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:23,258
- Allow me, madam.
- Give that to me, Gerda!

430
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:24,695
<i>Mademoiselle</i>, do no...

431
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,269
Poirot? What's happened?

432
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,665
Gerda has mur... I mean...

433
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,570
John has been shot.

434
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:47,670
He's dead.

435
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,561
Isn't really my line, murder.

436
00:36:58,786 --> 00:37:01,618
<i>Non</i>, but the procedure
it has been followed quite correctly

437
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:04,213
and, until the police arrive,

438
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:07,343
all we can do is to ensure
that the body it is undisturbed.

439
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:09,972
<i>and that nobody tampers
with the evidence.</i>

440
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,090
It's... it's a bit chilly.

441
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:17,137
- You alright if we wait in the pavillion?
<i>- Oui, bien sûr.</i>

442
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:36,453
<i>Can I offer you a cherry?</i>

443
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:39,623
<i>Non, merci</i>.
It's better not to touch.

444
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:41,109
- I suppose we can smoke.
<i>- Oui.</i>

445
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:42,658
<i>Non, non, merci.</i>

446
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:46,753
A very able fellow, Christow.
Very able.

447
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:52,922
Slightly too able,
if you take my meaning.

448
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,134
I just don't know what to do about lunch.

449
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:03,338
It seems so heartless
to be seating around a table,

450
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:06,416
stuffing oneself
as if nothing had happened.

451
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:08,287
Don't worry on my account, Lucy.

452
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:12,056
God bless you, dear Edward,
but say what you will,

453
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,856
murder is a very awkward thing.

454
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:19,468
It upsets the servants so,
breaks whole routine out.

455
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,644
The worst of all, it was duck
for lunch,

456
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,810
my very, very favourite!

457
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,658
What about Gerda, Midge?

458
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:30,414
Perhaps something on a tray
would be good.

459
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:34,581
I've placed sandwiches and some coffe
in the dining-room, milady.

460
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:36,895
Gudgeon, thank you!

461
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:44,015
Gudgeon really is a jewel, you know?

462
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,369
And a proper, substantial sandwich
is as good as lunch.

463
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:51,217
And there's nothing remotely heartless
about them,

464
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:52,818
if you know what I mean.

465
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:55,979
- Lucy, don't! This is all so awful!
- Oh! Midge!

466
00:38:57,423 --> 00:38:58,771
Don't cry, little Midge.

467
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,932
Monsieur Poirot,
this is Inspector Grange.

468
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,572
I expect you've heard
about Monsieur Poirot.

469
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,624
- I most certainly have.
- Inspector.

470
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,613
May I ask you what brings you
to these "neck o da woods"?

471
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,458
Well, I visit this "neck of the woods",
Inspector,

472
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,179
for the weekends.

473
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:26,074
My friends persuaded me
to purchase a cottage here.

474
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,655
It is the second one, in that way,
along the lane.

475
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,091
Are you fond of the countryside,
aren't you, sir?

476
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:32,700
<i>Le paysage</i> is most,</i>

477
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,188
except for the trees,
have this untidy habit

478
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,749
of dropping leaves.

479
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:42,344
And that path leads to the lane,
you say?

480
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:43,539
<i>Oui.</i>

481
00:39:43,703 --> 00:39:44,953
And that path leads to the farm

482
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:46,904
and that's where
Lady Angkatell came?

483
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,180
Edward Angkatell and Miss Savernake

484
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,081
came from the woods separately

485
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:54,095
and then they stood there and there?

486
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:57,663
<i>Oui,</i> it was like one
<i>mis-en-scène</i> from the theatre.

487
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,772
I'm giving Gerda some brandy.

488
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:07,894
Oh, how thoughtful of you, Henrietta.

489
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,491
Yes, I was remembering,
we were given a brandy,

490
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,628
for shock, when I was a little girl,
at Ainswick.

491
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,349
Of course, I suppose it's not
exactly a shock with Gerda, is it?

492
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:18,995
Personally, I don't know

493
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:22,107
how I would feel
if I'd just murdered my husband,

494
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:27,507
but wouldn't exactly be shock,
would it?

495
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:29,568
I mean, there wouldn't be
no element of surprise.

496
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:31,613
Why are you so sure
that Gerda killed John?

497
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:33,219
It seems so evident.

498
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,137
Why, what else do you suggest?

499
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,224
Isn't it possible that Gerda
came along to the pool,

500
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:39,781
found John lying there

501
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:42,897
and just picked up the revolver
when we came on the scene?

502
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,263
This is what Gerda says?

503
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,857
Yes.

504
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,779
Oh! Well,

505
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:06,184
fortunately, duck is...

506
00:41:06,305 --> 00:41:07,995
quite pleasant cold.

507
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,105
I couldn't lie down any longer.

508
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,264
I still can't believe
that it's real.

509
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:18,174
That John is dead.

510
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,069
Who could have killed him?

511
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,620
Who could possibly
have killed John?

512
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:34,351
This is my wife, Inspector Grange.

513
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:36,868
Lady Angkatell.

514
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:39,932
I was hoping to have a word
with Mrs. Christow.

515
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:41,736
There she is.

516
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,938
- Mrs. Christow?
- Yes, I'm Gerda Christow.

517
00:41:48,618 --> 00:41:50,256
I should just want to ask you a few--

518
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,208
He was a wonderful doctor.

519
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:54,927
So kind, so unselfish.

520
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:58,972
The best of husbands.
Who could've wanted to kill him?

521
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:01,923
What exactly happened,
Mrs. Christow?

522
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:03,851
It was all so sudden...

523
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:07,199
I went out from the house,

524
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,988
and along the path
to the swimming pool...

525
00:42:11,048 --> 00:42:12,567
What time was this?

526
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:16,718
About 12:58. I noticed the clock.

527
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:19,878
And, when I got there,

528
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:22,482
there was John, lying there,

529
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,280
and blood...

530
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,998
- Did you hear the shoot?
- Yes.

531
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,516
No... I don't know.

532
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,553
Sir Henry and Edward
were out shooting.

533
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:38,473
I just saw John... blood
and a revolver.

534
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:41,790
- And I picked up the revolver...
- Why?

535
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:45,507
I beg your pardon?

536
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:47,391
Why did you pick it up?

537
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,824
I don't know.

538
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,062
Shouldn't I have?

539
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,936
So you have decided that
Madame Christow shot her husband?

540
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,452
Yes, sir. Don't you think she did it?

541
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,616
It could have happened
as she said.

542
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:21,249
Yes, could have.
But it's a very thin story.

543
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:24,454
They all think she did it.

544
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:28,365
And you thought she'd done it,
didn't you?

545
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:31,010
When you first arrived
on the scene...

546
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,610
I am not sure what I thought.

547
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:37,451
Something was not <i>exactement</i>
as it should have been.

548
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:42,122
What's that?

549
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:45,559
Looks like leather work, sir.

550
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:50,675
- Oh, right.
- Sir, we got the weapon.

551
00:43:52,164 --> 00:43:53,438
Come on, pick it up.

552
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:58,077
Been in the pool, destroyed any
fingerprints that might have been on it.

553
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,511
Yes, it comes from my collection.

554
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:07,469
It's my hobby, Inspector.

555
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:16,712
- When did you last see this one?
- Yesterday afternoon.

556
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:18,943
We were doing some target practice.

557
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:21,342
Who actually fired the gun
on that occasion?

558
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:23,940
I think we all had at least
one shot with it.

559
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,300
- Including Gerda Christow?
- Including Gerda Christow.

560
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:28,020
And after the shooting?

561
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:30,821
I put the firearm back
in its usual place.

562
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:39,217
Will Sir Henry require a late supper,
milady?

563
00:44:39,383 --> 00:44:40,702
There is some duck leftover.

564
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:45,411
No, Gudgeon, he's driving
Mrs. Christow up to London as we speak.

565
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,973
He's staying at his club.

566
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:49,934
Gudgeon, about those eggs...

567
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,611
I meant to write the date on them,
as per usual.

568
00:44:54,176 --> 00:44:57,532
But, because of the confusion...
Could you kindly ask the cook?

569
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,691
I've seen to it myself,
milady.

570
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:01,606
Oh, bless you, Gudgeon.

571
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,888
- Do you think Gerda will be alright?
- Oh, yes.

572
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,524
She'll probably send for some
old school friend of hers.

573
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,059
She's probably got three or four.

574
00:45:12,488 --> 00:45:16,322
I can just see them, scrabbling
hockey types, from Turnbridge Wells.

575
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,117
What extraodinary things you do say,
Lucy!

576
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:22,198
Very well, Eastbourne and tennis,
if you insist.

577
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,357
I wonder if there're any left...?

578
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:29,559
- School friends?
- No! Policemen.

579
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:32,840
Don't they normally leave one
hovering in the hall?

580
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,912
Or outside, peeking behind a bush,
watching the door?

581
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:38,627
In case another murder
is comitted in the night?

582
00:45:38,757 --> 00:45:40,031
Lucy, don't...

583
00:45:41,076 --> 00:45:43,465
I'm so sorry, how stupid of me,
of course.

584
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:46,183
Gerda is on her way back to London.

585
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,989
Oh, dear. I didn't mean...

586
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:55,663
Tomorrow, I think it's better
to telephone the shop, you know.

587
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:58,346
Just tell them about the inquest.

588
00:45:58,828 --> 00:46:01,183
Just say you're staying off here
for a few days.

589
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:21,257
I haven't said anything, but...

590
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:24,334
... you do know how sorry I am?

591
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:26,005
Sorry?

592
00:46:26,176 --> 00:46:29,373
That John Christow's gone?
You didn't like John.

593
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:32,328
He and I hadn't much in common.

594
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:36,410
You had me in common.

595
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:39,210
Henrietta, for God's sake!
No need to be like that.

596
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,638
What did you think I'd be like?

597
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,718
Did you think I'd seat and cry
for a pocket handkerchief

598
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,884
while you'd held my hand?

599
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:49,964
You're nice enough, Edward,

600
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:55,644
but, honestly,
you are inadequate.

601
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:44,731
<i>Alô?</i>

602
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:46,410
Yes.

603
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:26,937
Monsieur Poirot,
we could use your brains.

604
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,938
Join us, would you?

605
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,009
So...

606
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:38,638
... which of the ladies did
this wrap belong to?

607
00:48:39,627 --> 00:48:42,389
I take it, sir, that you're referring
to the cape of artic fox.

608
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:46,097
<i>I noticed it yesterday, when I took
the cherry out to the pavillion.</i>

609
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:50,426
But it is not the property of anyone
in this establishment, sir.

610
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:53,245
Well, who's is it, then?

611
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,681
It might possibly belong to Miss Cray,

612
00:48:56,131 --> 00:48:57,803
the motion picture actrice.

613
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,801
She payed a visit after dinner,
the night before last,

614
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,960
for the purpose of borrowing
some matches, sir.

615
00:49:05,886 --> 00:49:07,956
<i>Did she take away six boxes?</i>

616
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:11,523
That is correct, sir.

617
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:15,013
Servants are the devil, aren't they?

618
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:17,459
Still Sir Henry identified the gun.

619
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,811
Which means that all Mrs. Christow
had to do was to get it from the study.

620
00:49:20,939 --> 00:49:22,167
Don't you agree?

621
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:27,197
- And her motive, what is it?
- Motive? Jealousy, I'd say.

622
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:28,789
<i>La jalousie?</i>

623
00:49:30,155 --> 00:49:31,304
<i>Peut-être.</i>

624
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:33,505
You know these fancy doctors.

625
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:37,023
He'd probably get one of those rich
lady patients a good "see to".

626
00:49:37,832 --> 00:49:40,744
And Lady Angkatell mentioned
some trouble with a nurse.

627
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,508
But she was a bit vague.

628
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,843
Yes, she would be vague.

629
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,478
I'm taking the train off to London.

630
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:52,322
I'm going to Harley Street.
Would you care to join me?

631
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,561
I don't remember any quarrels. No.

632
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:03,916
Mrs. Christow was devoted
to her husband.

633
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,999
Quite slavishly so.

634
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,316
- Tyrannical, was he?
- No.

635
00:50:09,238 --> 00:50:11,513
But he was what I would call
a selfish man.

636
00:50:11,857 --> 00:50:15,954
He took it for granted that Mrs. Christow
would fall in with his ideas.

637
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,675
You organized his appointments,
Miss Collins.

638
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:22,787
Any difficulty with patients?
Lady patients?

639
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:25,622
He had an excellent manner
with patients.

640
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:26,866
Yes, but any...

641
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,306
... hanky panky?
- Certainly not.

642
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,881
What about Mlle. Veronica Cray?

643
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:33,298
Veronica Cray?

644
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:35,687
Well, we believe she was a friend
of Dr. Christow's.

645
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:36,900
- Do you mean the actrice?
<i>- Oui.</i>

646
00:50:36,926 --> 00:50:38,757
I'd no idea he knew her.

647
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:42,098
Any ideas as to whom
might have killed Dr. Christow?

648
00:50:42,224 --> 00:50:44,180
Absolutely none at all, Inspector.

649
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:47,393
When the body was discovered,
Mme. Christow was standing beside it,

650
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:49,534
with a revolver in her hand.

651
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,656
Look, I don't know who you are,

652
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,369
but if you think Gerda Christow
killed her husband,

653
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:56,375
you are categorically wrong.

654
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:01,634
- It's the Inspector, Mrs. Christow.
- Thank you, Collie.

655
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:07,384
- Good afternoon.
- My friend Elsie,

656
00:51:07,991 --> 00:51:10,710
I mean, Mrs. Patterson.
- Ma'am.

657
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,822
This is Monsieur Poirot.

658
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:15,946
Have you found out who killed him?

659
00:51:17,128 --> 00:51:18,720
Uh... no, not yet Ma'am.

660
00:51:20,486 --> 00:51:22,920
- Was it you, Mrs. Christow?
- That's unfair!

661
00:51:23,365 --> 00:51:27,223
- Why do you persecute the poor woman?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

662
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:30,381
But perhaps Madame Christow
would prefer to speak for herself.

663
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:32,855
It was not me.

664
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,975
No.

665
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,932
It is a hard thing, to kill
the one you love, <i>n'est ce pas?</i>

666
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,170
A very hard thing, I should imagine.

667
00:51:41,257 --> 00:51:42,929
I couldn't do it.

668
00:52:01,408 --> 00:52:04,241
Balistic's report. We ran it
right away.

669
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:05,960
Have a look at that, Poirot.

670
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,230
<i>Merci, Madame.</i>

671
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,438
So the balistics report proves
that the gun in the pool

672
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,636
was not the one who killed
John Christow.

673
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:26,671
I've spoken to Sir Henry.

674
00:52:28,157 --> 00:52:31,190
He says that there is a gun missing
in his collection.

675
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:34,972
<i>A .38 Smith & Wesson,
brown holster.</i>

676
00:52:38,912 --> 00:52:41,251
I think this whole thing
could be a frame

677
00:52:41,352 --> 00:52:43,672
set up to implicate Mrs. Christow.

678
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,103
But, if that was so,

679
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,102
<i>why do not leave the right revolver
lying by the body?</i>

680
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:52,777
But she might not have pick it up.

681
00:52:53,986 --> 00:52:55,559
And it is possible, Inspector,

682
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,717
that the murderer might be someone
who wanted to kill Dr. Christow,

683
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,017
but did not want to implicate
Gerda Christow.

684
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:05,917
Well, he had a funny way
to work about it.

685
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,291
We suspected her right
from the start.

686
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,087
<i>Oui, mon ami.</i>
Very swiftly you suspected her.

687
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:14,289
Look, Poirot. You were a eye witness,
you saw everything.

688
00:53:15,176 --> 00:53:16,604
<i>Oui,</i> I saw.

689
00:53:16,896 --> 00:53:19,030
But the eyes of witnesses
are most unreliable.

690
00:53:19,254 --> 00:53:21,588
Sometimes, the eyes see
what they are meant to see.

691
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:24,245
You saying it was arranged?

692
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:27,221
<i>There was something about the tableau,
the people around the pool</i>

693
00:53:28,031 --> 00:53:30,800
it was false. And I can not
place my finger on what it was.

694
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,926
<i>There were three people,
Lady Angkatell,</i>

695
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:39,403
<i>Monsieur Edward Angkatell</i>

696
00:53:39,645 --> 00:53:41,237
<i>and Henrietta Savernake.</i>

697
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:44,278
Henrietta.

698
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:47,595
<i>And anyone of these three people
could have shot Dr. Christow</i>

699
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:49,360
<i>before Madame Christow arrived,
could have retreated</i>

700
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,820
<i>by one of the paths, turn around
and returned.</i>

701
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:53,805
Blimey, you're right.

702
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:56,150
There is also another possibility,
Inspector.

703
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:59,217
Someone could have come
from the path, along the lane,

704
00:53:59,456 --> 00:54:00,855
then fired the shot

705
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,406
and gone back the same way.

706
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:06,333
You're dead right.

707
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:11,368
And that could be Miss Veronica Cray.
Crime of passion. Bingo!

708
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,462
- You have interviewed her?
- Yes, I have.

709
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,065
Christow went to visit her
that morning.

710
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,419
They had a fight.
I spoke to the maid.

711
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,219
Cray said to him:

712
00:54:22,386 --> 00:54:26,584
"I hate you more than I ever thought
I could hate anyone!"

713
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:29,463
That is interesting.

714
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:32,797
And it was her fur coat in the pavillion?

715
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:34,280
Yes, it was.

716
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,234
<i>She must have left it there when she
entered to borrow the matches.</i>

717
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:39,509
I do not believe she went there
to borrow the matches.

718
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:41,868
She could have borrowed them from me
and saved the walk.

719
00:54:41,998 --> 00:54:43,033
No, no, no.

720
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:45,831
She was nervous,
on account of you being a foreigner.

721
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:50,148
<i>Et bien...</i>

722
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:08,963
<i>- Santé.
- Santé.</i>

723
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,916
You know something about human nature,
don't you?

724
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:21,558
I know a little
about human nature.

725
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,335
Inspector Grange has got into his head
that I quarreled with John Christow

726
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,728
on the day he died.

727
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,430
And did you?

728
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:34,366
I hadn't seen John for 12 years.

729
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:39,024
But the real truth is so fantastic that I'm
certain that a guy like Grange wouldn't believe it.

730
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:42,708
But I think you might
understand.

731
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:45,062
I am flattered, <i>Mademoiselle.

732
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:46,870
Actually, I am married.

733
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,223
<i>Madame.

734
00:55:50,828 --> 00:55:53,945
<i>12 years ago, John was
very in love with me.</i>

735
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:56,543
Even obsessively so.

736
00:55:56,825 --> 00:55:58,322
<i>He wanted me
to give up acting,</i>

737
00:55:58,544 --> 00:56:00,054
<i>having a life of my own,</i>

738
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,755
<i>even a mind of my own</i>

739
00:56:02,002 --> 00:56:04,593
He was so possessive and domineering

740
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:08,511
I thought I couldn't go through with it
and I broke off the engagement.

741
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:12,375
I'm affrai he took it
rather hard.

742
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:16,566
When we came back here,
on saturday night,

743
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:19,047
the whole thing blew up again.

744
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:22,450
He went mad,
quite literally mad.

745
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:26,972
<i>He wanted to leave his wife and children,
he wanted me to divorce my husband</i>

746
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,645
he wanted us to get back together.

747
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,649
He carried a torch for me,
all these years.

748
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:39,356
We argued and argued,

749
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:42,279
and in the end I had to send him
back The Hollow.

750
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:44,037
Next morning, he returned.

751
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,713
I told him it was impossible.
He insisted.

752
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:49,403
I told him I didn't love him,
I could never love him

753
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:52,593
and I begged him not to ruin
my life a second time.

754
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,152
I had to be brutal.

755
00:56:57,678 --> 00:56:58,952
Yes, I...

756
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:02,832
... said I hated him.

757
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:05,386
And we parted in anger. And...

758
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:09,106
... now he is dead.

759
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:16,460
- It is a tragedy.
- Undoubtedly.

760
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:23,857
Do you think I should say any of this
at the inquest?

761
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:26,398
I mean... his wife.

762
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:30,701
I can not see that it has any bearing
at the inquest.

763
00:57:31,303 --> 00:57:32,622
It is private.

764
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:36,453
And perhaps it should remain so.

765
00:57:50,897 --> 00:57:52,889
I talked with the kitchen maid, sir.
Simmons.

766
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,000
She says that, Sunday afternoon,

767
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:56,568
she saw the butler walk across the hall
with a revolver in his hand.

768
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,384
I'm very sorry, sir.

769
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:00,585
I suppose I ought to have mentioned it.

770
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:03,677
At about 17:30, I noticed
a revolver lying upon the hall table.

771
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:08,679
<i>I picked it up and brought it in here.</i>

772
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,519
There was a gap up there on the shelf,
so I put it where it belong.

773
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:13,798
Which one, Gudgeon?

774
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,410
This one, sir.

775
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:23,241
But that is not a revolver.
That is an automatic pistol.

776
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:26,178
I'm very sorry, sir. I'm affraid
I'm not fully informed about firearms.

777
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,339
Sir Henry, I'll have it
fully checked for fingerprints.

778
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:32,066
Oh!... I doubt there will be
any fingerprints, sir.

779
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,350
Why not?

780
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:38,606
Because I polished it
with my handkerchief before replacing it, sir.

781
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,869
Why the devil did you do that?

782
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,189
I felt it might be dusty, sir.

783
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:51,480
How nice to see you, Monsieur Poirot.

784
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:53,920
Oh, dear! There's a poor girl
in the kichen,

785
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,021
just sobbing her heart out.

786
00:58:56,926 --> 00:59:00,084
What have you been telling them
about the pistol, Gudgeon?

787
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:04,293
<i>Never mind, it doesn't matter.
I'll explain everything.</i>

788
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:05,964
You may go.

789
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:08,680
Dear poor Gudgeon, you know.

790
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:12,476
He tries so hard to protect us
from any kind of trouble...

791
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:15,633
This here is all quite feudal, you know?

792
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:18,671
But he didn't find the pistol
in the hall at all.

793
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:20,265
No, no, no.

794
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:22,511
He found it when he took out the eggs.

795
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,427
Eggs? What eggs?

796
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:28,187
You see, I went out to the farm
to collect the eggs.

797
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:30,264
I put the pistol on the egg basket

798
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:32,586
and then I put the new eggs
on top of the pistol.

799
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,701
When I came back and saw John
laying there,

800
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:36,621
well... I mean, unwell...

801
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:40,101
<i>... I sort of had a bit of a shock
and almost dropped the basket.</i>

802
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:43,657
<i>Dear sweet Gudgeon, as per usual,
sprang to my rescue.</i>

803
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:47,495
Later on, I wanted to write
the date on the eggs,

804
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:51,732
otherwise, you see, we tend to eat
the fresher eggs before the older ones,

805
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:54,012
and that simply will not do...

806
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,538
And then Gudgeon told me
he had taken care of everything.

807
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:02,897
And which pistol was that,
Lady Angkatell?

808
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:04,855
That was the Mauser.25.

809
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:08,535
And why did you put it into the basket?

810
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:11,733
Oh! I knew you would ask me that,
Monsieur Poirot.

811
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:16,726
Of course I... must have had a reason,
mustn't I, Henry?

812
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:20,967
I mean, I must have had some idea
worrying about in my head,

813
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:25,164
in order for me to put the Mauser
into the egg basket, in first place.

814
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:28,421
My wife is...

815
01:00:29,106 --> 01:00:31,904
<i>... extremely absent-minded.</i>

816
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:35,151
Sir Henry, if I may ask you a question.

817
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:39,157
How many people, in general, know
that the police can identify a gun

818
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,157
<i>by the little marks
on the bullet.</i>

819
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:42,234
The marks of the riffling.

820
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:45,351
I think that's pretty well common
knowledge nowadays, Poirot.

821
01:00:54,593 --> 01:00:56,685
I was just taking the dog for a walk.

822
01:00:57,513 --> 01:01:00,008
I love peaking
in other people's houses.

823
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,023
Do you mind if I take a look?

824
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,186
But certainly, <i>Mademoiselle,
entrez,</i> if you please.

825
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,100
I would be most grateful, however,
if the dog might be kept outside.

826
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:22,136
How beautifully tidy!

827
01:01:23,381 --> 01:01:26,930
You'd hate my studio.
There's clay all over the place,

828
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,656
and glaze, and paint bottles...

829
01:01:29,778 --> 01:01:31,928
But I understand,
you are an <i>artiste.

830
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,452
Aren't you an artist too,
Monsieur Poirot?

831
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,407
On the whole, I would say...

832
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:42,083
<i>... non.</i>

833
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:45,763
<i>I've known crimes that were artistic,
supreme exercises of imagination.</i>

834
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:47,923
But the solving of them, <i>non.</i>

835
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,880
The criative power
is not what is needed.

836
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:55,767
<i>What is required
is a passion for truth.</i>

837
01:01:57,326 --> 01:01:59,281
And, once you have the truth,

838
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,382
once you have knowledge,
is that enough?

839
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,395
Or do you have to go one step further

840
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:05,496
and transform
the knowledge into action?

841
01:02:09,281 --> 01:02:11,675
Why did you come here,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Savernake?

842
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:15,589
As I said, I was
taking the dog for a walk.

843
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:19,194
It is odd I did never take notice
of a dog on my visits to the Angkatell.

844
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:25,270
That might be because
they haven't got one.

845
01:02:27,153 --> 01:02:28,984
I borrowed the gardener's.

846
01:02:29,272 --> 01:02:31,911
Don't actually like animals much,
dogs, horses...

847
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:34,906
horrible, smelly things.

848
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,380
I am not, <i>Monsieur Poirot,

849
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:42,300
<i>terribly truthful.</i>

850
01:02:43,785 --> 01:02:44,854
<i>Non.</i>

851
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,820
But I think that you have integrity.

852
01:02:53,182 --> 01:02:54,740
The inquest is tomorrow.

853
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:56,580
Is it necessary, do you know,

854
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,453
the Police to know
that I was John Christow's mistress?

855
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:01,573
You were lovers?

856
01:03:02,097 --> 01:03:05,328
I do not think that the Police
has any difficulty in discovering this.

857
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:08,654
I suppose not.

858
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:12,848
Why should Gerda bear
such heavy burden?

859
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:16,491
She adored John
and now she is dead.

860
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:21,244
I didn't break up his married life.

861
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:24,845
I was one of a procession, along
with Veronica Cray and all the others.

862
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:27,117
- So he was like that?
- No!

863
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,243
He was a noble man,

864
01:03:34,284 --> 01:03:35,683
a fine man.

865
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:41,751
He was doing a vital research
into a debilitanting disease.

866
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,409
It's called Ridgeway's,
there is no known cure.

867
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:46,894
He was working on it night and day,
for months.

868
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:49,266
His curiosity,

869
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:52,032
his determination...

870
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:54,652
Oh! I wish I could make you understand.

871
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:57,634
- But I understand.
- Really?

872
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:02,048
You mentioned Veronica Cray.

873
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:05,626
She also was a friend of Dr. Christow?

874
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,721
They were engaged
to be married 12 years ago.

875
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:10,352
Were they?

876
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:12,445
<i>Look, I'll make it simple.</i>

877
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:17,241
Veronica was, and is,
a bitch of the first water.

878
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:19,615
She wanted John to give up
medicine

879
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,540
and go and live with her
in Califórnia.

880
01:04:21,783 --> 01:04:25,253
So he broke off
and subsequentely married Gerda.

881
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,052
He had a number of affairs,
which Gerda never knew nothing about.

882
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:32,409
But he really never got over Veronica.

883
01:04:34,257 --> 01:04:36,248
And in the last Saturday they met,

884
01:04:37,176 --> 01:04:39,326
for the first time in 12 years.

885
01:04:42,653 --> 01:04:44,291
He went out to see her home

886
01:04:45,412 --> 01:04:48,051
and he returned to the Hollow
at 03:00 a.m..

887
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:49,885
Yes. How do you know?

888
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,080
The housemaid had a toothache.

889
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:55,843
Lucy has far too many servants.

890
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:57,845
And how is it that you know?

891
01:04:58,326 --> 01:04:59,964
I was watching out my window.

892
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:03,077
The toothache, <i>Mademoiselle?

893
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:07,714
Quite another kind of ache,
Monsieur Poirot.

894
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:14,873
If you see me with a pistol in my hand,
Simmons, the proper thing to do

895
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:17,787
<i>is come to me and say:
Mr. Gudeon, would you be so kind</i>

896
01:05:17,898 --> 01:05:20,198
and give me an explanation.

897
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:22,590
Yes, Mr. Gudgeon.

898
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:27,269
The improper thing to do
is to go babbling to the Police.

899
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:30,061
That is common.

900
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:34,866
Where would Her Ladyship be,

901
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:37,037
if we all run
doing things like that, hmm?

902
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,822
Lucy, why did you take the pistol?

903
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:42,224
I'm not entirely sure, Henry.

904
01:05:42,627 --> 01:05:45,141
I do recall, though, waking up
that morning

905
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:47,676
with some sort of premonition,

906
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:50,987
that there might, just might,
be some kind of accident..

907
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:53,686
Accident, who might
have had an accident?

908
01:05:54,099 --> 01:05:55,887
Well, obviously, John Christow.

909
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,731
<i>And, I mean, one does feel awfully
sorry, of course,</i>

910
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:02,293
and one does tend to blame oneself...
- Good God, Lucy!

911
01:06:02,578 --> 01:06:03,647
Oh, Henry!

912
01:06:04,717 --> 01:06:06,196
Oh, Henry! Oh, Henry,

913
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:11,970
I'm so dreadfully worried about Ainswick.

914
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,584
If Edward never marries,

915
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:17,344
and he won't, you know,

916
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:18,951
if Henrietta turns him down,

917
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:21,687
it will all die out. It will.

918
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:26,321
They will break it up
and sell it off in little tiny pieces.

919
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:29,136
Lucy,

920
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:33,456
does it really, honestly, matter?

921
01:06:33,784 --> 01:06:35,595
Of course it matters.

922
01:06:36,263 --> 01:06:38,254
Ainswick is my home.

923
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,099
It's all our land. No...

924
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,291
Somebody'd got to get rid of him.

925
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:47,098
Lucy, you didn't...

926
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,851
Don't be such a fool.

927
01:06:49,427 --> 01:06:51,736
Do you really believe, for a moment,

928
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,137
that I could've shot him?

929
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:56,972
I invited him here, Henry.

930
01:06:57,704 --> 01:07:00,173
One doesn't ask guests
for the weekend

931
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:02,089
and start bumping them off.

932
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:05,245
- Did your aunt like John Christow?
- Lucy?

933
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:07,722
Lucy's a cousin, not an aunt.

934
01:07:07,969 --> 01:07:09,607
Yes, she liked him very much.

935
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:12,704
And your... also cousin,
Mr. Edward Angkatell,

936
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:15,520
- did he like Dr. Christow?
- Not particularly.

937
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:18,322
And do they like Madame Christow?

938
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:21,154
It's not a matter of liking her,
she's famíly.

939
01:07:21,283 --> 01:07:23,978
- Is she?
- We're not all rich, you know?

940
01:07:24,162 --> 01:07:26,479
Gerda is from a branch
of rather humble Angkatell's.

941
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,879
She's tolerated, I think it's fair to say,

942
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,252
because she's one of us.

943
01:07:30,429 --> 01:07:31,750
And your understanding of tolerance

944
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:33,457
would be to sleep with her husband?

945
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:51,085
Why did you take the revolver
out of the hand of Madame Christow

946
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,852
and drop it into the pool?

947
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:55,568
A Gerda is very clumsy.

948
01:07:55,668 --> 01:07:57,383
She might have fired it
and hurt someone.

949
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:59,385
But you're not clumsy,
are you?

950
01:07:59,397 --> 01:08:00,750
<i>And yet you dropped it.</i>

951
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,774
If there were fingerprints
on that revolver,

952
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:06,776
that is to say, fingerprints
before <i>Madame</i> Christow handled it,

953
01:08:06,944 --> 01:08:09,063
it would've been intersting
to know who's they were.

954
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:11,652
Meaning that you think
that they were mine.

955
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,071
<i>You're suggesting that I shot John</i>

956
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:15,462
and then left the revolver beside him

957
01:08:15,629 --> 01:08:17,570
so that Gerda could come along
and pick it up.

958
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:21,010
But if I'd done that, give me
credit for enough intelligence,

959
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:23,287
to have wiped my own figerprints off first.

960
01:08:23,586 --> 01:08:26,514
But, Mademoiselle, you have
enough intelligence to know

961
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:28,571
that if there would be no fingerprints
in the revolver, other than Madame Christow's,

962
01:08:28,783 --> 01:08:31,585
other than </i>Madame</i> Christow's,
it would be <i>très remarcable.</i>

963
01:08:31,652 --> 01:08:33,389
Because you were all shooting
with the revolver

964
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,780
the day before.

965
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:38,446
And there are something else we have
just discovered.

966
01:08:38,589 --> 01:08:31,267
We now know that the revover that was
dropped into the pool

967
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,004
was not the revolver that killed
John Christow.

968
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,222
He was shot with a quite different gun.

969
01:08:47,346 --> 01:08:48,972
And you think that I shot him?

970
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:51,203
When he was dying,

971
01:08:51,563 --> 01:08:53,838
John Christow said:
"Henrietta."

972
01:08:55,122 --> 01:08:56,760
I told you, we were lovers.

973
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:58,838
Oh yes, of course . He was your lover.

974
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,394
So, as he was dying, he says,
"Henrietta."

975
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,839
Very touching.

976
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:05,837
- I don't think there is any need to sneer.
- I am not sneering.

977
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:08,073
But I do not like being lied to.

978
01:09:09,276 --> 01:09:11,585
I've admitted
that I'm not very truthful.

979
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:15,584
But I don't kill people, Monsieur Poirot.

980
01:09:39,982 --> 01:09:42,416
Gerda! Poor dear, Gerda.

981
01:09:42,661 --> 01:09:46,097
I'm so sorry. Not getting too
a little sleep, I trust.

982
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:49,296
What is an adjournment, you know?
You must be famished.

983
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,768
Why don't you come back
to the Hollow for lunch?

984
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,649
I'm taking Gerda directly home.

985
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:56,853
She needs rest and quiet,
not this.

986
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:06,404
What did they see in Christow?

987
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,484
That wretched woman
is completely heartbroken.

988
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,726
- Poor devil.
- Are you all packed?

989
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,517
I'm getting lift to town.
All set.

990
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:16,997
Come on, Midge. Bye, Edward.

991
01:10:19,645 --> 01:10:20,794
Bye.

992
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:23,839
Edward!

993
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,434
- Damn cold!
- It is, rather.

994
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:47,144
What's this one?
It looks a bit like Gerda.

995
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:49,710
Cowed and hunched.

996
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:51,425
She modelled for me.

997
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,664
Don't you dare tell her
that's what what I ended up with.

998
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:56,467
I call it "The Worshiper".

999
01:10:56,589 --> 01:10:57,783
Who is she worshiping?

1000
01:10:59,108 --> 01:11:00,257
John.

1001
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:08,214
Did you understand all that business
with the second gun?

1002
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:12,143
No, but it lets Gerda off the hook,
doesn't it?

1003
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:17,218
Let's have some tea and toasts,
then I'll take you to your lodgings.

1004
01:12:07,517 --> 01:12:08,870
Mademoiselle, do not!

1005
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:14,426
John has been shot. He's dead.

1006
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:32,340
Edward, Midge,
how wonderful to see you both!

1007
01:12:34,386 --> 01:12:37,378
He rescued me from Madame Alfrege.
It was frightfully romantic.

1008
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:40,300
I was whisked from the shop and taken
to lunch at The Connaught

1009
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,221
and, do you know what?
I never went back.

1010
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:46,456
I'm a dull dog, I know.
I am no much good at anything.

1011
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,536
I just read books, putter about.

1012
01:12:48,859 --> 01:12:51,896
Midge has agrred to come to Ainswick
and be my wife.

1013
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,854
And nothing could make me happier.

1014
01:12:54,976 --> 01:12:56,694
Of white satin, don't you think?

1015
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:59,769
And ivory Prayer Book.
What about bridesmaids?

1016
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:02,165
Oh, I don't fuss.
Just a quiet wedding.

1017
01:13:02,293 --> 01:13:04,932
I quite agree. They don't match,
do they?

1018
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:08,488
I mean it, there's always
a rather plain one, that ruins the whole--

1019
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,808
Absolutely dozens of them,
poking about in the woods,

1020
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,923
making a terrible mess
with all the pheasants!

1021
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:17,400
Why are they still here?

1022
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,642
They're searching for
the missing revolver, Midge.

1023
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,076
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle.</i>

1024
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,427
Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.

1025
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:48,707
Will they find it, do you think?

1026
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:50,187
Soon, I should say.

1027
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:55,623
You have returned very suddenly
from London, Mademoiselle.

1028
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:58,021
There's a party for Midge
and Edward,

1029
01:13:58,148 --> 01:14:00,378
who, believe it or not,
are getting married.

1030
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:04,299
Why, did you think the murderer
would return to the scene of the crime?

1031
01:14:07,585 --> 01:14:09,416
You know, it did seem to me,
from the very beginning,

1032
01:14:09,544 --> 01:14:11,933
that either this crime was very simple,
so simple

1033
01:14:12,502 --> 01:14:14,891
that it was very difficult to believe
in its simplicity,

1034
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:16,773
<i>or it was very complex.</i>

1035
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,738
And it is to say

1036
01:14:19,219 --> 01:14:22,256
that we are contending against a mind
that is able of inventions

1037
01:14:22,378 --> 01:14:24,369
that are intricate and ingenious.

1038
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:27,605
<i>So that every time we seem
to be heading towards the truth,</i>

1039
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:30,611
we're actually being led away from it.

1040
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,772
A mind that is subtle

1041
01:14:33,013 --> 01:14:34,890
and yes, very ingenious,

1042
01:14:35,612 --> 01:14:37,807
which is plotting agaist us
the whole time.

1043
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:39,689
And succeding.

1044
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:44,760
What is that to do with me?

1045
01:14:45,767 --> 01:14:48,281
It is a creative mind, <i>Mademoiselle.

1046
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:52,676
- And this is a strange tree.
- It's a Igdrasil.

1047
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:55,115
A memento of my childhood,

1048
01:14:55,244 --> 01:14:57,758
I draw it everywhere, doodling,
you know.

1049
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,630
I've seen it before, in the pavillion,
by the pool.

1050
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:06,353
In the pavillion?

1051
01:15:06,638 --> 01:15:09,277
Where it must have been drawn
on Sunday morning.

1052
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:11,749
Oh yes, on the little table.

1053
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:14,784
- But that was on Saturday afternoon.
<i>- Non, non...</i>

1054
01:15:15,355 --> 01:15:18,074
<i>It was not there when Gudgeon
brought the cherry glasses.</i>

1055
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,707
- Then it must have been in Sunday afternoon.
- Non,

1056
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:26,789
because Grange's men
did not leave the area until dusk.

1057
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:30,337
Oh, yes! I remember.
It was after dinner, on Saturday.

1058
01:15:30,468 --> 01:15:31,981
<i>Non, Mademoiselle Savernake.</i>

1059
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:35,099
People do not doodle in the dark.

1060
01:15:36,386 --> 01:15:38,820
No, I think you were in the pavillion
on Sunday, after 12:00,

1061
01:15:38,944 --> 01:15:40,536
<i>when Gudgeon brought out
the cherry glasses.</i>

1062
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:44,178
I think you stood by the table,
watching someone, waiting for someone

1063
01:15:44,342 --> 01:15:46,060
and you doodled.

1064
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:53,737
I didn't go down to the pool until 13:00.

1065
01:15:54,537 --> 01:15:57,370
Just after John Christow
had been shot.

1066
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,285
But Igdrasil testifies against you.

1067
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:03,126
You were there and shot Dr. Christow

1068
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:05,842
or you were there and saw who did.

1069
01:16:06,172 --> 01:16:07,969
This is outrageous!

1070
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:10,322
Do you think you are cleverer than I?

1071
01:16:25,964 --> 01:16:27,841
The inquest resumes tomorrow,

1072
01:16:28,722 --> 01:16:31,873
and all I've got is vague suspicions
leading to nowhere.

1073
01:16:32,841 --> 01:16:35,514
Nowhere, instead of somewhere.
That is it.

1074
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,916
Do you know, half the time I think
those Angkatells know all about it.

1075
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,114
Oh, they do know all about it.

1076
01:16:44,316 --> 01:16:45,749
Henrietta Savernake?

1077
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:48,793
Nothing from her either.
She went straight to Chelsea.

1078
01:16:48,913 --> 01:16:51,268
I searched her studio
with a fine tooth comb,

1079
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:55,588
but there's no gun.
Just art pieces.

1080
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,944
Sculptures,
funny looking horses,

1081
01:16:59,589 --> 01:17:01,466
bits of wood, metal...

1082
01:17:02,027 --> 01:17:04,416
- Horses, did you say?
- Wel, one horse.

1083
01:17:04,547 --> 01:17:06,299
If you can call it a horse.

1084
01:17:06,426 --> 01:17:08,656
- A horse?
- Yeah, what's so fascinating about that?

1085
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:11,139
It's a point of psicology, Inspector.

1086
01:17:11,624 --> 01:17:14,013
How quickly can you get me up
to London?

1087
01:17:34,493 --> 01:17:35,721
What're you looking for, sir?

1088
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,075
This.

1089
01:17:54,405 --> 01:17:55,520
The horse.

1090
01:17:59,323 --> 01:18:00,438
<i>Merci.</i>

1091
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:03,040
Quite good, actually.

1092
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:33,783
<i>Merci.</i>

1093
01:18:42,263 --> 01:18:43,582
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

1094
01:18:46,942 --> 01:18:49,410
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Savernake
doesn't like horses.

1095
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,205
<i>Voilá.</i>

1096
01:19:02,694 --> 01:19:06,528
I think that this will prove to be
the murder weapon.

1097
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:12,925
- So Miss Savernake did it.
<i>- Non!</i>

1098
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:17,166
Looks to me bloody likely.

1099
01:19:17,688 --> 01:19:21,237
No, Mademoiselle Savernake
is not, in my opinion,

1100
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:23,400
a murderer.

1101
01:19:24,565 --> 01:19:29,400
Let us be quiet about our discovery,
for the time being, Inspector.

1102
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:31,995
And watch.

1103
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,597
Let us be intelligent.

1104
01:19:38,518 --> 01:19:39,951
<i>Is Her Ladyship at home?</i>

1105
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:42,587
You will find Lady Angkatell
in the greenhouse.

1106
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:46,909
If I might,
the inquest is concluded,

1107
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,954
murder by person or persons
unknown.

1108
01:19:50,593 --> 01:19:53,551
Is it necessary to trouble
Her Ladyship further, sir?

1109
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:11,379
Lady Angkatell.

1110
01:20:12,644 --> 01:20:13,963
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

1111
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,683
Tell me, what are your views
on compost?

1112
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,712
I've come to offer you apologies
for the inconveniencies you have suffered.

1113
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:25,955
It's high time to put a full stop
to the whole thing.

1114
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,549
You do understand me, don't you?

1115
01:20:30,236 --> 01:20:32,192
I'm not sure that I do, Lady Angkatell.

1116
01:20:32,755 --> 01:20:37,067
Oh, come, come, Poirot.
You understand perfectly!

1117
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:40,871
Since Inspector Grange
has failed to find the murder weapon,

1118
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:43,308
he'll have to let the whole thing drop.

1119
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,423
You, I dare say, won't.

1120
01:20:48,508 --> 01:20:51,261
Non, I shall not let it drop.

1121
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,222
What if were told the truth?

1122
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:56,576
Would you like to tell me the truth?

1123
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,097
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, I would love
to tell you the truth.

1124
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:03,530
Then, of course, we could all agree

1125
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:07,061
that John Christow
is over and done with.

1126
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,819
Could we, Madame?

1127
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:15,729
You really are very foreign, aren't you?

1128
01:21:18,655 --> 01:21:21,567
Are you quite sure you have not
something, Lady Angkatell?

1129
01:21:44,724 --> 01:21:47,716
Something just came upon me,

1130
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:53,633
you might have overlooked it.

1131
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:57,988
I could be wrong, of course,
and you could've handled everything,

1132
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:00,712
but since you never mentioned it,

1133
01:22:01,476 --> 01:22:02,750
I'm a little concearned...

1134
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,103
What's the matter, Lucy?

1135
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:05,794
- It's the holster.
- What?

1136
01:22:06,794 --> 01:22:08,307
Oh Henrietta, the holster!

1137
01:22:09,032 --> 01:22:11,751
The gun was in a holster!

1138
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:33,500
- Yes, Collie?
- It's Miss Savernake.

1139
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,613
The holster, Gerda!
Where is the holster?

1140
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:38,096
You have to give me the holster
and then you'll be safe.

1141
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,410
Not completely safe.
<i>Dommage.</i>

1142
01:22:41,258 --> 01:22:42,486
Poirot!

1143
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:45,332
How did you...?

1144
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:48,335
Sometimes, the fastest car
it is not fast enough, Mademoiselle.

1145
01:22:49,055 --> 01:22:51,694
Not when it races against the brain.

1146
01:22:53,613 --> 01:22:55,092
Where are the children?

1147
01:22:55,652 --> 01:22:58,530
- Elsie's taken them to the Zoo.
- Thank Heaven for that!

1148
01:23:08,886 --> 01:23:10,842
I know that you killed your husband,
Madame.

1149
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:14,360
Yes.

1150
01:23:15,963 --> 01:23:17,157
I did.

1151
01:23:18,162 --> 01:23:19,720
Why did you do it, Gerda?

1152
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,554
Why did you kill John?

1153
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,591
Because it was all a lie!

1154
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:27,793
Everything!

1155
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:32,555
I thought he was the noblest man
in the world.

1156
01:23:35,634 --> 01:23:37,943
But I saw his face

1157
01:23:38,673 --> 01:23:41,426
when he followed that woman,
that evening...

1158
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:52,465
I knew he'd loved her,
before he'd married me, but I thought...

1159
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:57,018
I thought it was over.

1160
01:23:59,024 --> 01:24:02,141
<i>I tried to sleep, but I couldn't.</i>

1161
01:24:07,141 --> 01:24:08,574
<i>It was the middle of the night.</i>

1162
01:24:11,019 --> 01:24:12,577
<i>I had to know.</i>

1163
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:17,456
They were there.

1164
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:20,853
I could hear them.

1165
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:25,128
John

1166
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:29,484
and Veronica Cray.

1167
01:24:46,523 --> 01:24:47,922
I believed in him

1168
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:50,520
as though he were God.

1169
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:52,840
I worshiped him.

1170
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,436
And it was all a lie.

1171
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:01,916
I had to kill him.

1172
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,144
You do see that?

1173
01:25:07,594 --> 01:25:08,743
I had to!

1174
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:16,143
I am not quite so stupid
as everyone thinks.

1175
01:25:24,547 --> 01:25:27,698
<i>I knew I could kill John
and the Police would never know</i>

1176
01:25:28,705 --> 01:25:31,094
<i>because I had read in this novel</i>

1177
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,296
<i>how they can tell
which gun fires the bullet.</i>

1178
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:37,095
<i>So, I took two.</i>

1179
01:25:45,337 --> 01:25:48,693
<i>Sir Henry had shown
how to load and fire</i>

1180
01:25:48,856 --> 01:25:50,130
<i>the day before. It was easy.</i>

1181
01:25:50,295 --> 01:25:51,774
You shove the cilinder
back into the frame

1182
01:25:52,894 --> 01:25:54,327
and you're ready for shooting.

1183
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:12,758
<i>I'd shot with one</i>

1184
01:26:13,485 --> 01:26:14,964
<i>then hide it</i>

1185
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:19,316
<i>and let them find me
holding the other.</i>

1186
01:26:20,282 --> 01:26:23,354
<i>I forgot about the leather thing.</i>

1187
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,272
- The holster.
- I forgot about it too.

1188
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:29,551
I also forgot.

1189
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:34,427
The memory, it is selective,
<i>n'est ce pas?</i>

1190
01:26:36,315 --> 01:26:39,625
And then I heard Inspector Grange
mention this holster, this holster of leather--

1191
01:26:42,272 --> 01:26:44,263
I remembered where I had seen it before.

1192
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,344
What's that?

1193
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:53,300
Looks like leather work, sir.

1194
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:59,506
Where is your bag
for the leather work?

1195
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:05,821
I-I think it's in the surgery.

1196
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:07,690
The surgery?

1197
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,049
I seat there. In his chair.

1198
01:27:15,337 --> 01:27:17,248
I'll fetch it for you, shall I?

1199
01:27:24,174 --> 01:27:25,448
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

1200
01:27:31,131 --> 01:27:32,280
But Madame...

1201
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:35,961
Oh, I'm not going anywhere,

1202
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:40,121
don't worry.

1203
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,710
When you return to your studio,
I'm affraid you'll discover

1204
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,503
that one of your sculptures,
it has been destroyed.

1205
01:28:22,828 --> 01:28:25,058
It is the sculpture
of the head of the horse.

1206
01:28:31,504 --> 01:28:33,335
It could have worked, <i>Mademoiselle,

1207
01:28:33,703 --> 01:28:36,422
if you did not tell me
how much you detested the creatures.

1208
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:41,412
I know that you were helped
by your family,

1209
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,129
once they knew what you wanted done.

1210
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,012
Henrietta.

1211
01:28:48,377 --> 01:28:50,811
Isn't it possible that Gerda
came along by the pool,

1212
01:28:50,935 --> 01:28:52,448
found John lying there

1213
01:28:52,575 --> 01:28:55,248
and just picked up the revolver
when we came on the scene?

1214
01:28:56,213 --> 01:28:58,602
This is what Gerda says?

1215
01:29:00,332 --> 01:29:01,447
Yes.

1216
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:06,525
But why do you wanted it done,
<i>Mademoiselle?

1217
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:08,287
Because John asked me to.

1218
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,438
That's what he meant
when he said, "Henrietta".

1219
01:29:11,566 --> 01:29:13,318
He was asking me to protect
Gerda.

1220
01:29:13,486 --> 01:29:16,046
And he knew that I'd do
anything he wanted, because...

1221
01:29:17,284 --> 01:29:18,478
... I loved him.

1222
01:29:20,843 --> 01:29:21,992
<i>Oui.</i>

1223
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:35,834
I began to realize the truth

1224
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:40,264
when I saw there was a pattern,
a pattern to implicate everyone,

1225
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:42,985
other than Gerda Christow.

1226
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,029
You deliberatly planted Igdrasil

1227
01:29:48,191 --> 01:29:50,910
to catch my attention
and put yourself under suspicion.

1228
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,141
I put the pistol on the egg basket

1229
01:29:53,308 --> 01:29:55,663
and then I put the new eggs
on top of the pistol.

1230
01:29:55,987 --> 01:29:58,217
Oh, I doubt there'll be
any fingerprints, sir.

1231
01:29:58,346 --> 01:30:01,543
Because I polished it with my handkerchief
before replacing it, sir.

1232
01:30:02,464 --> 01:30:05,536
And Lady Angkatell, and the family,
they closed hands and colluded, because...

1233
01:30:07,302 --> 01:30:12,535
There's only one thing to do, if you want
to clear from suspicion the person who is actually guilty,

1234
01:30:15,539 --> 01:30:17,848
suggest guilt elsewhere,

1235
01:30:19,137 --> 01:30:20,775
but never localize it .

1236
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:28,526
<i>- Vite!</i>
- Oh, my God!

1237
01:30:29,692 --> 01:30:30,727
Gerda!

1238
01:30:32,331 --> 01:30:33,525
Gerda!

1239
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,526
Help her, for God's sake!

1240
01:30:44,086 --> 01:30:45,314
It is too late.

1241
01:30:51,962 --> 01:30:53,441
Potassium Cyanide.

1242
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:55,835
Wife of a doctor...

1243
01:30:56,561 --> 01:30:58,552
<i>She knew exactly what to do.</i>

1244
01:31:27,706 --> 01:31:29,059
What happens to me now?

1245
01:31:33,904 --> 01:31:35,337
Go, my child.

1246
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:40,537
Your place is with the living.

1247
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,650
I will remain here with the dead.

1248
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:05,650
