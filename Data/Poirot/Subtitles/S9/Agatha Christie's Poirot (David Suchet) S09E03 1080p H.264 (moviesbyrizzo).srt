00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:22,689
<i><b>Based on Agatha Christie's novel
DEATH ON THE NILE </b></i>

2
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,258
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright, my darling.

3
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,761
I just can't believe
that they'd do this.

4
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,847
I know, I know...

5
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,934
- Everything I touch...
- You mustn't think like that.

6
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,479
We have each other,
and our whole lives to look forward to.

7
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,609
I'm broke, Jackie.
What sort of a future is that?

8
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,654
Well, I have some put aside.
That'll save us for a little while.

9
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,867
I'll think of something,
I promise.

10
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,077
I promise you, my darling.

11
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,297
We love each other and
that's all that matters, yes?

12
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,019
She's had the most terrible luck.

13
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,604
When we were students together,
in Paris,

14
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,564
her father ran off with some woman

15
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,817
and her mother lost all her money
in the stock market crash.

16
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,528
And Jackie was left absolute penniless.

17
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,239
I don't know how she's managed
these past few years.

18
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,034
- Oh, she wants something, I bet.
- I've offered to help, but she won't hear of it.

19
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,995
Isn't it awful when one's friends
fall on hard times?

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,872
One's simply got to drop them.

21
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,415
She sounded very excited,

22
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,293
but then she always does.
It's the Latine in her.

23
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,505
The boys' are back from their ramble.
England's manhood...!

24
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,801
You and Tim seem awfully close.
Is there something I don't know about?

25
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,055
Heavens, no! The only woman
in Tim Allerton's life is his mummy.

26
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,975
It's all far too "Sophoclean"
for my taste.

27
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,105
And what about the good Lord?
Still panting for you, is he?

28
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,982
He's not the panting type.

29
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,943
According to the gossip columnists,
you're halfway up the aisle.

30
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,405
No! Not yet! Not ever.
Not with him, anyway.

31
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,408
But, darling, he's absolutely rolling.

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,243
So am I.

33
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:27,040
Ah, so divine! I bet these cost
more than the house.

34
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,753
Looks and money.
I can't believe I like you.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,048
- Joanna, darling, you don't like anyone.
- Don't I? Oh, well...

36
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,509
Yes?

37
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,307
Mademoiselle de Bellefort
will be here for supper.

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,808
Thank you, Louise.

39
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,731
What on earth's wrong with her?

40
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,026
Look, that ghastly boyfriend
is in trouble with the law

41
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,654
and can you believe she's asked me
to send bail for him? I said, ''On no account

42
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,074
''and, frankly, prison
is the best place for him.''

43
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,577
- Dear!
- She'll get over it.

44
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,412
Allow me.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,541
God, I wonder what Jackie wants?

46
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,173
The fact is, darling, I'm engaged...

47
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,175
So, that's it! Who is he?

48
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,804
His name's Simon Doyle. And he's big,
and boyish and deliciously uncomplicated.

49
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,765
He worked in the City,

50
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,602
but they, well, are cutting down,
and he's out of his job.

51
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,855
Linnet, I'll die, if I can't marry him,
I shall simply die!

52
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,067
- Dear, you've got it bad!
- When I heard you had bought this place

53
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,028
I realized you'd be needing a land agent,
and then I thought ''Simon!''

54
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,655
Oh, darling, he'd be just perfect.

55
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,115
He loves the country
and knows all about estates

56
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,827
and if he doesn't do it right,
well, you can always sack him.

57
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,413
Say <i>oui,</i> Linnet! Please!

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,041
Oh, I knew you wouldn't let me down!

59
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,253
We want to go to Egypt for
our honeymoon. Can you imagine?

60
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,130
Walking down an avenue of Sphynxes
with the man you love?

61
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,007
Could anything be more romantic?

62
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,218
Bring him along
and I'll take a look.

63
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,179
- Well, actually he's here.
- What?

64
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,641
Just in case you said yes.
You'll adore him.

65
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,606
Simon!

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,530
This is Simon Doyle.
Simon, this is Linnet Ridgeway,

67
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,533
the most wonderful friend
a girl can have.

68
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,085
Well, now,
isn't this simply lovely.

69
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
Isn't that Hercule Poirot?

70
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,456
Do you mean that dwarfish looking creature
mincing down the stairs?

71
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,500
That's not very nice of you.

72
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,462
What on earth is he doing here?

73
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,969
I'd love someone would dance
with me.

74
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,056
But who on this planet would dance
with you?

75
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,851
- Perhaps someone would want me, if...
- And pigs might fly.

76
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,021
Remember, my dear,
why you're here...

77
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,982
- To be handy, cousin Marie.
- Precisely.

78
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,694
After you prepared my "coucher",
you may attend to my eggnog.

79
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,741
You're not getting grumpy,
are you, my darling?

80
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,953
- If there were more young people around...
- Whatever for?

81
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,374
- You'd like it if Joanna were here.
- No, no I wouldn't.

82
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,920
In fact, I wouldn't care
if I wouldn't see Joanna ever again.

83
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,257
I don't need Joanna
when I have you...

84
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,760
Oh! Darling...

85
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,562
- My God, did you see that?
- Keep your voice down.

86
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,940
- She could be his mother.
- She is his mother.

87
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,735
I need some air.

88
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,366
<i>Merci.</i>

89
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,330
<i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>- Madame.</i>
- Salome Otterbourne.

91
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,837
<i>- Enchanté.</i>
- That French charme.

92
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,715
- You French are all the same.
- I am Belgian, Madame.

93
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,303
I was thinking if you'd care
to take the magic trip avec <i>moi?</i>

94
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,889
- Trip?
- I know this is the wrong way round,

95
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,933
but, after all, we are...
liberated now.

96
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,902
I was a great supporter
of the "Suffragettes", you know...

97
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,157
So, are you here on business, Monsieur?
Are there great affairs to be dealt with?

98
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,743
You know, Madame,
I am simply the man of leisure.

99
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,955
Essential, <i>n'est-ce pas,</i>
to be out of London in January?

100
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,709
Poor man.
She's got her claws into him already.

101
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,837
I'm here for the local colour.
My new book,

102
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,299
''Snow on the Desert's Face'',
is set on these parts.

103
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,719
No doubt, of course,
it'll cause another furor,

104
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,888
but, no matter, I speak the truth.

105
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,016
Why is everyone so affraid
of sex?

106
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,772
The stars of the show.

107
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,942
You'd think she'd have
some sense of shame.

108
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,610
Don't be so old-fashioned.

109
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,654
She's rather lovely,
I must admit.

110
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,282
Linnet Doyle is the only heiress
in England who doesn't look like an horse.

111
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,160
Hello, Andrew.

112
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,703
Spectacular!

113
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,205
Right over here.

114
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,878
It seems that everybody who is anybody
is in Egypt, <i>ce soir.</i>

115
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,298
The lure of the fresh spot,
no doubt.

116
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,133
- Remember Simon?
- Yes.

117
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,135
Incredible, isn't it?

118
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,224
Millions unemployed,

119
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,519
a lunatic about to take the power
in Germany and all we read about is

120
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,439
some spoiled brat ditched a Lord
for her best friend's fiancé.

121
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,442
Some people have everything.

122
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,572
Depends on
what you think's worth having.

123
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,328
- Hello, Simon.
- Hi, how are you?

124
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,038
Hello, Tim.

125
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,498
Linnet, you're divine.

126
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,460
This Andrew Pennington, my american trustee.
We just bumped in him in Cairo.

127
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,629
Oh, yes, quite a coincidence...

128
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,007
Mother, I'm sure Monsieur Poirot
would like to rest.

129
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,509
<i>Non, non, non...</i>
I think that is a great idea.

130
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,139
<i>Non, non,</i> because my dinner seems
a little reluctant to settle.

131
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,016
If you'll excuse me...

132
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,477
Of course, <i>Monsieur.</i>
We shall resume <i>très bientôt.</i>

133
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,105
<i>Au revoir.</i>

134
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,452
Linnet!

135
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,997
What a simply divine surprise!

136
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,545
We just can't stop bumping
into each other, can we?

137
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,256
Hello, Simon.

138
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,093
You look a little tired, darling.
Wearing you out, is she?

139
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,891
I'd hang on tight, ducky (dear).
He's a slippery fish.

140
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,020
I'll be seeing you.

141
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,151
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

142
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,991
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- I hope my mother

143
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,952
hasn't exhausted you.

144
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,538
- Not at all.
- I know how exhausting she can be.

145
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,208
- Linnet Doyle's very beautiful, isn't she?
-<i> Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

146
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,043
And very rich too.

147
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,046
I read about her in the papers, of couse,
seen her photograph everywhere,

148
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,049
but nothing can quite prepare you
for how lovely she's in the flesh.

149
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,386
I don't think I've ever
hated anyone so much on first sight.

150
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,137
But not all that glitters...

151
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:24,142
Not in her case.
Life is not fair, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

152
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,145
Has life been unfair to you,
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

153
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,022
You've met my mother.

154
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,866
<i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

155
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,285
- I didn't mean to startle you...
- <i>Non, non, non...</i>

156
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,537
... but I am very anxious
to speak to you.

157
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,122
At your service, <i>Madame.</i>

158
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,916
- You know who I am, perhaps?...
- Yes, I know exactly who you are.

159
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll go straight to the point:

160
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,671
I'm a victim
of an intolerable persecution.

161
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,048
Persecution?

162
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,093
Perhaps if you could explain
a little further...?

163
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,013
It's really very simple.
Before I met my husband,

164
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,141
he was engaged to a friend of mine,
Jacqueline de Bellefort.

165
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,019
Now, they weren't remotely suited
and he broke it off.

166
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,897
She, I'm sorry to say,
has taken it rather badly,

167
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,817
and, out of pure spite, has chosen
to hound us wherever we go.

168
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,278
And you are here, I understand,
on your honeymoon...

169
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,072
That's right. Now, she first appeared
in Venice,

170
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,075
and then in Brindisi, then in Cairo,
and now here.

171
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,786
She simply cannot be allowed
to carry on like this.

172
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,998
But she's perfectly within
her rights.

173
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,792
I'm sorry, did you not see
the way she behaved just now?

174
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,378
<i>Oui,</i> but she did not
actually threaten you,

175
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,464
or cause you any bodily harm.

176
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,300
<i>Non,</i> evidently she is very much
aggrieved, <i>Madame.</i>

177
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,094
If you're implying that I stole
my friend's fiancé,

178
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,180
then I assure you're wrong.

179
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,182
She loved him, yes,

180
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,476
but her feelings
were not reciprocated.

181
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,020
Even before he met me,
he knew he'd make a mistake.

182
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,899
But wasn't there a moment
when you realized that you had a choice?

183
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,693
You have everything,
but your friend,

184
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,947
from what I understand,
had him only.

185
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,867
<i>Non.</i> Pardon my impertinence,
<i>Madame,</i> but

186
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,787
I suspect you're feeling
a little guilty.

187
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,415
Couldn't you, at least,
try to reason with her?

188
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,292
<i>Madame,</i> I am on holiday.

189
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm sure we could come
to some kind of arrangement.

190
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,798
<i>Non, Madame,</i>

191
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,717
I am sure we could not.

192
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,096
Excuse me.

193
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,641
She did threaten to kill us,
you know.

194
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,897
But then, she does have a tendency
to be a little dramatic.

195
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,259
I suppose you saw
our little floor show...

196
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,719
<i>Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

197
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,888
I'm affraid I rather lost my head.

198
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,725
They serve us
the most lethal Martinis in this place.

199
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,019
Bury your dead, <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

200
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:16,231
Mrs. Doyle sent you?
Got you on her payroll already, has she?

201
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,901
She has approached me,
that is true, but I declined.

202
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,446
You must look to the future.

203
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,908
- Oh, she'd love that!
- I'm thinking of you.

204
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,246
- You have before you your whole life.
- Simon is my life.

205
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,665
I can see that you loved him...

206
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,505
We loved each other, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>
And Linnet was my best friend.

207
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,508
- How could she...?
- It takes two.

208
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:47,721
She knew exactly what she was doing
and he fell for it.

209
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,266
One of the richest women
in England,

210
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,894
no wonder it went to his head.

211
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,273
You know, we had even planned
to come here for our honeymoon?

212
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,069
- He loves me, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>
- Even now?

213
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,990
No, not now.

214
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,869
Now I think he hates me.

215
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,419
Pretty, isn't it?

216
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,759
I've quite a good shot, actually.
My father taught me.

217
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,430
I have to admit it crossed
my mind to use it,

218
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,725
but then I thought... no.

219
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:39,356
Wouldn't it be much more fun
to just follow wherever they went

220
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,111
and just when they thought
it was safe to relax,

221
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,738
there I'd be,

222
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,533
the ghost of the banquet.

223
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,953
- You must stop this now.
- And let them get away with it?

224
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,123
Do not open your heart to evil,
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

225
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,835
If you do, there'll be no turning back.

226
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:05,007
She has taken everything from me,
Monsieur Poirot.

227
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,011
And I want to hurt her,

228
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,432
to put my gun against her head

229
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,561
and, gently, pull the trigger...

230
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,356
Oh God, I'm so affraid.

231
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,571
What is it?

232
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,157
Over there...
someone was listening...

233
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,661
- I cannot see.
- I think they're gone.

234
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,626
I can not do what you ask,
<i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

235
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,278
Good morning.

236
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,531
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur Doyle.</i>

237
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,283
- And how is <i>Madame?
- Absolutely pooked (tired),</i>

238
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,494
said she needed
a little more shutter.

239
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,790
God, I'm  ravenous! Isn't it marvellous
they're doing English breakfast here?

240
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,543
I cannot stand those little brioche...
Do you?

241
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,296
Did you--
Have you managed to speak to Jacqueline...

242
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,049
<i>- Miss de Bellefort?
- Oui.</i>

243
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,178
- Did you get her to see sense, or...?
- Non, I'm affraid not.

244
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,431
But decent girls just
don't do that sort of thing!

245
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,269
She's making a complete ass of herself
and playing merry hell with Linnet's nerves!

246
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,523
- And yours, <i>Monsieur</i>?
- Oh, I'd like to wring her neck!

247
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,819
Between ourselves, <i>Monsieur,</i>
I've hatched a plan.

248
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,113
I'm letting been known
that Linnet and I

249
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,031
are staying put
for the next couple of days,

250
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,577
but I've in fact booked us
on a Nile cruise leaving tomorrow morning,

251
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,204
under false names, of course.
- Of course.

252
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,290
Then we'll make it look like
we're going on an excursion,

253
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,958
the maid will take charge
of the luggage,

254
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,794
we'll hop aboard on the last minute,
and "Bob's yer uncle"!

255
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:10,382
By the time Jacqueline realizes
we won't be coming back, it'll be too late.

256
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,385
So, what do you think?
Good wits?

257
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,138
She has the brains, <i>Monsieur</i>.
We shall see.

258
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,557
- I myself will also be in the cruise.
- Really?

259
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,808
<i>Oui.</i>

260
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,977
Oh! Not on any way, I hope,
on our account...

261
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,063
<i>Non, non, non</i>. Not at all. I make
my plans well in advance.

262
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,858
That is the only way
to succeed in life, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

263
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,027
Yes, I suppose it is...

264
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,114
- Who is that gentleman?
- A chap called Pennington,

265
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,909
Linnet's trustee.
Bumped in him by chance in Cairo.

266
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,995
I must say he was not far from sick
to find out she was married.

267
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,914
- Care to join us?
- <i>Non, non, non.</i>

268
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,707
But thank you very much.

269
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,794
Jolly nice to talk to you, anyway.
To have old kidneys back there.

270
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,820
Isn't that our trunk?
You think it will be alright?

271
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,367
Welcome.
Welcome to the S.S. Karnak.

272
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,247
- I'm so sorry.
- Do you mind?

273
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:29,253
Off! Off! Don't let them touch
the luggage. They don't wash!

274
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:33,465
Heavens, a floating tomb!
Don't push me to the sea.

275
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,431
Oh! The black hole of Calcuta!

276
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,813
It's so beautiful!

277
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,191
- Where's my other luggage?
- I left it with the man.

278
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,236
<i>Merci.</i>

279
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,257
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

280
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,151
There's something about this place,
don't you think?

281
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,822
Something unsettling
one can't quite resist.

282
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,033
<i>Oui.</i>

283
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,410
I had no idea they were coming.

284
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,293
Oh, this is heaven, darling!

285
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,342
Darling, I thought
you were staying at the hotel!

286
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,429
What a hoot! I'm sure
we're having an absolute bore!

287
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,562
You refused to help, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>,
look what happens.

288
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,147
But this is not my making, <i>Madame.</i>

289
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,441
How could she have known
that we would be on the boat?

290
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,777
- If you are suggesting...
- I am suggesting nothing,

291
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,863
<i>Monsieur</i>, but I will tell you this,
everybody hates me, ok?

292
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,949
I'm surrounded by enemies.

293
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,810
The way some of them look...

294
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,229
After all we've done for them...

295
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,192
<i>- Monsieur Poirot!
- Madame. Monsieur Allerton.</i>

296
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,657
Now, Mr. Poirot,

297
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,744
perhaps you could help put a face
on one or two of the passenger list.

298
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:13,041
- Dr. Bessner, for example.
- Over there, Madame.

299
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,044
Oh yes, the plump one,

300
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,381
with the shaved head
and the Bismarck moustache.

301
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,467
- German, no doubt.
- No, Austrian, I believe.

302
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,052
A boche, whatever.

303
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:27,890
So, by a process of elimination,
the rather glum looking gentleman

304
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,268
must be Mr. Ferguson.
- <i>Oui</i>, a progressive thinker,

305
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,812
so I understand.
- Bragging bolshy, more like.

306
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,442
Now, there's someone I'd throw
my cap into the arene for.

307
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,819
- Mother!
- That ruthless jaw.

308
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,531
And extremely rich.
As are most people here.

309
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,658
My, she's ugly!

310
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,703
Looks something unearthed
from a dig.

311
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:55,292
Isn't she lovely?

312
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,086
<i>Madame.</i>

313
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,881
She really knows
how to make an entrance.

314
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,200
- Good night, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.
- Good night, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>.

315
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,913
You were surprised
to find me here?

316
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,750
I am more sorry than surprised.

317
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:42,005
You have chosen a path
that is most dangerous, <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

318
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,133
I doubt that you would turn back now,
even if you could.

319
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,718
Ah, well...

320
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,347
One must follow one's star.

321
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,435
Love is not everything.

322
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,732
But it is, it is.

323
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,945
You must know that, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

324
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,364
Surely you understand.

325
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,623
It is terrible, Mademoiselle,

326
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,211
all that I have missed in life.

327
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,517
- Good night, <i>Monsieur Poirot</i>.
- Good night.

328
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,800
So, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Robson,
your companion, she does not come ashore?

329
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,221
Well, you see, cousin Marie has to be
very careful about her health,

330
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:15,390
but she was frightful kind and said
it would be alright for me to come.

331
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,268
- That is most gracious of her.
- Oh yes, she is.

332
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,020
It's simply wonderful of her

333
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,606
to bring me on this trip.
I'm such a lucky girl!

334
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:28,737
I always dreamed of traveling. It's amazing,
have you ever in your life...?

335
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,789
Isn't it miraculous
what Man can create?

336
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,084
People died building this,
you know?

337
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:46,547
So you preferred it there were no sfynxes,
no beautiful tombs, no temples?

338
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,634
It's people that matter,
not stones.

339
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,454
God, what were they actually for?

340
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,998
I never really thought about it.

341
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,584
Perhaps they were their equivalent
to garden gnomes.

342
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,461
Nice try, Simon,
but just a little wide of the mark.

343
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,423
The sphynx was, in fact,
a monster from Greek mythology

344
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,925
with a woman's head.

345
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:35,220
See? And a lionesse's body
and said--

346
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:40,809
Don't you want to know?
It said riddles to travelers

347
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:44,271
and killed those who got them wrong.

348
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,701
Just sign right there.

349
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:04,500
And this is the lease agreement
for the Fifth Avenue apartment.

350
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,834
Yes.

351
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,669
Yes, sign right there.

352
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,340
- It's perfectly in order.
- I'm sure it is, but I like to read everything.

353
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,093
Gosh, I never read
a legal document in my life!

354
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,222
- How careless of you.
- It's really straighforward, my dear.

355
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,226
- It's just a lot of legal jargon.
- I just sign at the dotted line.

356
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,270
Now that can be quite risky,
don't you think?

357
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,065
Darling, if you carry on this way
we'll be here all day.

358
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,278
- Why don't we... do this later?
- I think it's a very good idea.

359
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,113
It's getting frighfully hot up here.

360
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,035
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry, cousin Marie,

361
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,830
but I couldn't find it.
- You're a really hopeless creature.

362
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,457
I can be rather stupid,
can't I?

363
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,000
You most certainly can.

364
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,378
Oh, you forgot your magazine.

365
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,424
What is the point of
someone like that?

366
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,304
And that rich kid? Signs
a few documents and then has to rest

367
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,014
because it's so frightully hot.

368
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,308
And what sets you apart,
<i>Monsieur</i> Ferguson?

369
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,352
I make people aware.

370
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,772
And I certainly don't swan around
like a fop.

371
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,860
Why are you actually here,
<i>Monsieur Poirot</i>?

372
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,279
I'm on holiday. And you?

373
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,824
I'm studying conditions.

374
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,045
- <i>Monsieur Poirot...
- Madame.</i>

375
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:34,923
I'm so sorry, it's all the motion.

376
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,426
I cant seem to find my sea legs.

377
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,511
All this pitching and jolting!

378
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,013
I think it would be best if--

379
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,307
- Where's that wretched girl?
- You do go back inside, <i>Madame.</i>

380
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,767
Leaving me to suffer,
hour upon hour...

381
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,395
God help if we go down,
<i>Monsieur Poirot!</i>

382
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,732
The thought of being nibbled
by haddock and carp...

383
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:55,444
- It is a little too dangerous out here, hm?
- Yes, yes...

384
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,946
You might be swept overboard.

385
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,033
And end my days in Neptun's arms,

386
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,120
covert in carbuncles
like an old wreck...

387
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:37,819
<i>Non, non, non, non...</i>

388
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,591
No doubt it was
a pleasant surprise

389
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,011
to run into Linette Doyle
and discover she was married.

390
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,430
Yes. Yes, it was.

391
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,643
Well, actually she did write me
about it,

392
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,688
I'd already left
New York,

393
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,399
on the Carmanic.
- Oh! The Carmanic?

394
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:16,859
Yes.

395
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,946
Most fortunate then,
that you had with you all of her documents.

396
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,365
That's truly none of your business.

397
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,409
But, as you mentioned it,

398
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,077
I had them sent over
after we met.

399
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,788
Now, if you'll excuse me...

400
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:44,178
Don't fall on the hole...

401
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:58,567
... the goddess Hathor was often depicted
as the winged cow of creation,

402
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,153
who gave birth to the entire universe.

403
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,113
Oh, my! She did keep herself busy.

404
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:06,200
And occasionally, she can be
mistaken for Isis,

405
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,495
magically impregnanted
with the seed of her own son.

406
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,372
- "Heavens to Betsy"!
- Cornelia!

407
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,083
I'm sorry...

408
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,466
A nice curvy girl...

409
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,093
This is what I like.

410
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,726
When are we gonna  see
some more pyramids?

411
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,853
I thought Egypt was full of them.

412
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:38,982
Let go... we've had enough.
go away, little hauls!

413
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,614
Oh! What a wonderful way
to be remembered.

414
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:49,576
Maybe I'll have one build
in the ground

415
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,329
you can be buried in it, too.
- I'll say!

416
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:55,749
So we'll give the locals
something to talk about.

417
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,960
A-- Aagh!

418
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,381
My God!

419
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,262
<i>- Madame, Monsieur</i>...
- Are you hurt?

420
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,475
Isn't that fascinating!

421
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:17,020
The godess Hathor was a beautiful woman
with the head of a cow.

422
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,273
Still, I supose that's better than
being a cow

423
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,066
with the head of a beautiful woman.

424
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,361
This place is simply drenched in
historical goodies like that.

425
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,536
- I thought...
- Yes, <i>Monsieur</i>, I know.

426
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,538
I know what you thought.

427
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,215
Tim, what happened?

428
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,702
<i>Bonjour.</i>

429
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,122
<i>Pardon... Je ne comprends pas,
Monsieur...</i>

430
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,376
Did I fool you?
Poirot, you old dog!

431
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,628
- How's tricks?
- Colonel Race!

432
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:17,592
- I do not believe my eyes! How are you?
- Saddled and flittered.

433
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:21,304
- Otherwise, Tip Top.
- What a big surprise to see you here!

434
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,349
Well, I've been sorting out
a few local difficulties, you know

435
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:27,769
restless natives, odd assassinations,
that sort of thing.

436
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:30,021
- I say, that's pretty daring.
- <i>Oh! Merci.</i>

437
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,774
You know, you really must give me
the name of your taylor.

438
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,069
<i>- Oui</i>. Where are you heading?
-  Back up the river with you.

439
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:39,280
With me? But surely you can go
on a government steamer.

440
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:41,199
In normal circumstances, yes.

441
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,910
But when I heard that my old chum Poirot
was on the vicinities,

442
00:34:44,035 --> 00:34:47,580
I thought it would be much more fun.
Something always seem to happen around you.

443
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:51,125
- It might have already started, <i>mon ami</i>.
- Oh, jolly good!

444
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:56,839
<i>Madame Allerton, Madame Otterbourne,
allow me to introduce a very old friend of mine,</i>

445
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,800
<i>Coronel Race.</i>

446
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,414
- Miss Robson.
- Where have you been?

447
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,332
You're unusually breathless.

448
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:34,127
And blotchy.

449
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:37,422
I'm sorry, cousin Marie.
I was just outside...

450
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:39,882
And what have you done
with my velvet stole?

451
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:43,720
- Shall I see if it's in the cabin?
- It couldn't possibly be in the cabin.

452
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:46,556
I had it in here after dinner
and I haven't moved since,

453
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:49,016
have I, Dr. Bessner?
- No, Miss Van Schuyler.

454
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,894
It was on that chair
and it's not now.

455
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:55,356
- I thought you must have taken it.
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.

456
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:59,861
It was a gift
from </i>Count von Mecklenburg.

457
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,908
Miss Van Schuyler,

458
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:07,744
Miss Robson.

459
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:58,002
<i>Bonne nuit, Mademoiselle.</i>

460
00:36:58,211 --> 00:37:01,089
- You look tired, Monsieur Poirot.
- <i>Oui, oui, c'est vrai.</i>

461
00:37:01,297 --> 00:37:03,049
It must, I think, be the heat.

462
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,301
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

463
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:36,332

469
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:57,478
Right...

470
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,398
- Decided to make a night of it?
- No, no.

471
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:03,860
I just don't want to bed yet.
It's such a beautiful night.

472
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:05,987
It is lovely, isn't it?

473
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:08,656
Just perfect for a honeymoon.

474
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:14,370
- Two large gins.
- Oh, no! I couldn't.

475
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:15,955
Oh, nonsense!

476
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,541
What's our score, Simon?

477
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,002
Sorry...

478
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:23,546
We've made 120 below the line.

479
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,923
Not bad looking, don't you think?

480
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:27,592
Well, I don't know about that...

481
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:30,887
You better watch out,
there are no man-eaters around here.

482
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:33,389
I'm so sorry,
I suddenly got very tired.

483
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,767
And it is rather rowdy in here.

484
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:38,269
Yes, time to turn in.

485
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:43,066
- Are you coming, Simon?
- I'll...

486
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,735
I'll just finish my drink.

487
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,785
Good night.

488
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:01,000
- Well...
- My dear, you didn't have your night cup, yet.

489
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,045
- No...
- We girls must stick together.

490
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:09,592
- I'm absolutely gasping.
- Thank you.

491
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:14,305
To love, marriage,
stuff like that.

492
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:22,730
- Tell me all about yourself.
- Oh, dear!

493
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:25,775
There isn't really that much to tell.

494
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:30,321
I live at home, in Connecticut.
In a little town, called Bellfield,

495
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:35,410
this is my first trip to Europe
and I'm just loving every minute...

496
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,955
- Go on.
- I live with my mother,

497
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:41,666
whose health is, unfortunately,
a little delicate, at the moment.

498
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:45,336
She sleeps very badly and she eats
only in the middle day,

499
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:47,380
some days, just a piece of fruit or two,

500
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:49,549
some days, she'll only touch cereals...

501
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:53,010
- Do go on.
- Yes, yes. We're all ears.

502
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:56,723
- I really must go to bed.
- Don't go.

503
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:59,726
- I want to hear more.
- There isn't any more...

504
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:02,729
- Please.
- Well, I love art,

505
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:08,359
and I go to classes.
I sculpt a little and make pots...

506
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,862
Sounds a hoot.

507
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:14,073
- Ring the bell, Simon.
- It's after midnight.

508
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,993
- But I need a drink.
- You've had enough.

509
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:18,578
So what?

510
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:28,046
- A bit of fresh air.
- I think it's time...

511
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:30,381
Don't leave, Cornelia.

512
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,760
You see, Simon here is affraid

513
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,264
affraid that I tell you the story
of my life.

514
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:41,517
- Go to bed, Jackie.
- Affraid of a scene, are you?

515
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:43,936
Want me to behave decently,
like you behave to me?

516
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,147
Do you really think you can get away
with this?

517
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,648
You're drunk.

518
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:50,526
I said I'd kill you, and by God,
I meant it.

519
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,944
Miss de Bellefort!

520
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:54,989
I'll shoot you like a dog!
Like the dirty dog you are!

521
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:58,493
Mr. Ferguson! Mr. Ferguson!

522
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,748
Good God!

523
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,291
I didn't...

524
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,384
Ferguson, someone's coming.

525
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:16,469
Tell him it's an accident,
it is nothing.

526
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,934
Nothing to worry about.
Charades, that's all.

527
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:26,020
A game. Fun...

528
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:27,814
Yes... Yes.

529
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:35,154
Well, I don't think anyone else sould've heard.
It sounded like a cork popping.

530
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:37,490
- What have I done?
- It'll be alright.

531
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:39,575
Get her out of here, for God's sake,
take her to the cabin!

532
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:41,369
And don't let her be left alone,
whatever you do!

533
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:44,163
Don't worry, Mr. Doyle.
I'll stay with her.

534
00:41:44,747 --> 00:41:46,833
Get Dr. Bessner
to take a look at this.

535
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,292
I'll kill myself...

536
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,421
Please, please don't let my wife
get wind of this...

537
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:54,215
This way, let's go.
It's alright...

538
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,103
His poor leg... My God,
and if he bleeds to death?

539
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:10,023
Miss de Bellefort,
I don't think that will happen.

540
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:12,567
Let go of me!
I want to drown!

541
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:14,736
That wouldn't solve things.

542
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:16,863
I'll call Dr. Bessner.

543
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:27,832
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- We need your help! Someting's happenned.

544
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:36,132
<i>Gott in Himmel!</i>

545
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:47,810
It is bad. The bone is fractured
and he has lost a lot of blood.

546
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,647
<i>Herr</i> Ferguson, we must take him
to my cabin.

547
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:56,194
Gently...

548
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:00,406
Careful...

549
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,415
That's just the best I can do.

550
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:11,751
You've been a hero, my friend.

551
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,255
Now, I will give you something
to help you sleep.

552
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:21,260
- Has anyone told <i>Frau</i> Doyle?
- No. It can wait until tomorrow.

553
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:26,224
I... You mustn't blame Jackie.
It's my fault.

554
00:43:26,891 --> 00:43:29,435
I was a creep.
She didn't know what she was doing.

555
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,939
<i>- Ja, ja</i>.
- She might hurt herself.

556
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:37,527
Someone ought to stay with her.

557
00:43:37,694 --> 00:43:40,071
It's alright. Miss Robson is with her.

558
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:42,156
Good...

559
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:47,787
The pistol.
Can't leave it lying around.

560
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,872
Stewards will find it.

561
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,542
I'll get it.

562
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:11,686
- It's gone.
- Are you sure?

563
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:15,565
Yes. It dropped out of her hand,
she kicked it under a chair.

564
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,402
- I saw her do it. But it's not there.
- Who could have taken it?

565
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:48,890
<i>Entrez!</i>

566
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:54,062
Ah! My dear Coronel, what a
beautiful morning, </i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

567
00:44:54,645 --> 00:44:56,773
I'm afraid someone's been shot.

568
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,862
- Who?
- Linnet Doyle, last night.

569
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,031
Shot through the head.

570
00:45:13,706 --> 00:45:16,709
The pistol was held
close against her head.

571
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,337
- See? Where the skin is scorched?
- <i>Oui.</i>

572
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:23,007
There was no struggle.
She was shot in her sleep.

573
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:24,592
Time of death?

574
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:28,763
She's certainly been dead six hours,
and probably not longer than eight.

575
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:30,848
Between twelve and two.

576
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:35,895
May I ask you, Colonel,
with what authority you make these inquiries?

577
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:42,110
The Cruise Manager's asked me
to take matters in hands until we reach port.

578
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:45,071
I have some slight official standing,
you see?

579
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:48,282
- We are all at the disposal of the Coronel.
- Yes, quite.

580
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,827
- Now, what's all that about?
- What? This?

581
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:53,162
Well, it seems very simple,
does it not?

582
00:45:53,955 --> 00:45:56,040
It would appear that she is dying,

583
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,168
she writes with her finger
dipped into her own blood,

584
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:01,754
the inicial of the name of the murderer:

585
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,091
Jacqueline de Bellefort,

586
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:09,595
a young lady who, less than a week ago,
declared to me that:

587
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:14,225
''I would like nothing better
than to place my gun against her head"

588
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:17,103
''and, gently, pull the trigger.''

589
00:46:17,228 --> 00:46:19,689
So, I suppose her husband
is next door?

590
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:22,442
At the moment,
he is in my cabin, asleep.

591
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,902
He spent the night in your cabin,
Dr. Bessner?

592
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:31,534
<i>Ja. Ach.</i> I see you have not heard.

593
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:33,161
Mr. Doyle was also shot last night.

594
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:35,079
- What?
- In the leg.

595
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,707
Is there anyone else
we should know about?

596
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:39,834
That is all.

597
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:43,963
It seems that Mademoiselle de Bellefort
worked herself up, helped by a few drinks,

598
00:46:44,088 --> 00:46:45,882
and finally took a shot at him.

599
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:48,384
The poor man is completely
immobilized.

600
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:51,095
Then she went down to
Linnet Doyle's cabin and shot her as well.

601
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,972
No, no, no, that's not possible.

602
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:54,849
You see, she was
in an hysterical state

603
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:57,393
and Doyle was most concerned
she should not harm herself,

604
00:46:57,977 --> 00:47:00,521
so Miss Robson stayed with her
all night.

605
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:03,483
- Who discovered the crime?
- It was the maid, apparently, Miss Bourget.

606
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:07,653
- Coronel, my office is ready for you, sir.
- Thank you.

607
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:11,032
If you could be
as discreet as possible...

608
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:13,409
- It's our speciality, old chap.
- Yes, of course.

609
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:18,664
Now, we need to speak to Doyle.
You say he's still asleep?

610
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:21,042
I gave him a very strong opiate.

611
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:25,338
I would suggest I have my breakfast
and then I will see if he's ready to wake.

612
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:29,175
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Colonel.

613
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,972
So, at midnight <i>Madame</i> Doyle
was alive and well.

614
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:38,017
- Yes, I saw her to her cabin.
- Who was remaining in the lounge?

615
00:47:38,184 --> 00:47:41,479
Doyle, Miss de Bellefort,
Miss Robson and myself.

616
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:44,440
- What were you all doing?
- Mr. Ferguson was reading a magazine,

617
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:47,944
and I'd got embroiderie
and Miss de Bellefort was...

618
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:49,946
- Drinking.
- Yes.

619
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,656
Like a fish.

620
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,658
And I tried to leave once or twice,
but she made me stay

621
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:55,284
and I was getting
very uncomfortable

622
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,329
and so was Mr. Ferguson,
he went out on deck.

623
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:00,915
It was pretty stuffy in there.

624
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,710
Then, Miss de Bellefort
pulled out a pistol

625
00:48:03,835 --> 00:48:06,879
and shot Mr. Doyle in the leg
and I called for Mr. Ferguson.

626
00:48:07,046 --> 00:48:10,633
And Mr. Doyle said not to make a fuss,
then one of the stewards came.

627
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,594
And Mr. Ferguson told him
it was all a sort of a game

628
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:17,640
and then Miss de Bellefort started to cry
and so we took her to her cabin.

629
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:20,768
And I stayed with her,
while Mr. Ferguson got Dr. Bessner.

630
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,312
- At what time was this?
- Mercy, I don't know.

631
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:25,440
About twenty past twelve,

632
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:28,443
because it was half past
when I finally turned in.

633
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:31,529
And you are quite sure that
Mademoiselle de Bellefort did not leave the cabin?

634
00:48:31,654 --> 00:48:32,947
Positive.

635
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:36,826
And she couldn't have shot Mrs. Doyle
before, let's say at twenty past twelve?

636
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,705
How long did you remain with her,
Mademoiselle Robson?

637
00:48:40,872 --> 00:48:43,207
Well, I was with her all night.
She never woke once.

638
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:45,084
I think it was probably the drink.

639
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:47,170
<i>Bien</i>. So far,
she has the alibi <i>parfait.</i>

640
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:48,713
And <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle,
I understand,

641
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,631
was most anxious
that she should not be left alone.

642
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:53,926
Yes, he was quite worried
that she might do something stupid.

643
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:56,971
She even said that she wanted
to kill herself.

644
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:58,514
And the pistol?

645
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,308
- What happenned to that?
- She dropped it.

646
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,727
And kicked it under a chair,

647
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:04,562
but when I went to get it,

648
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,231
it'd gone.

649
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:11,319
Gone?

650
00:49:13,404 --> 00:49:15,615
Now we begin to arrive.

651
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,826
You are quite certain
that <i>Mademoiselle de Bellefort</i>

652
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:21,037
did not recover it
before she left the lounge?

653
00:49:21,162 --> 00:49:22,622
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

654
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:25,917
And she had no opportunity
of returning to retrieve it.

655
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,960
So how long was it between the time

656
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:31,255
that you and you and Dr. Bessner
carried <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle out to the cabin

657
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,424
and when you returned to look
for the pistol?

658
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:35,259
- Five minutes?
- Five minutes.

659
00:49:35,385 --> 00:49:37,011
In those five minutes,
someone removed the pistol

660
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:39,889
and that someone
was not <i>Jacqueline de Bellefort.</i>

661
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:45,853
Then we may assume
that this person has overheard

662
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,980
or seen
some of the events preceeding.

663
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:50,775
- But how d'you made that up?
- Because you told us

664
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,278
that the pistol was out of sight,
so it could hardly be discovered by accident.

665
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:56,906
Well, I saw no one on the deck
before the shot was fired.

666
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:59,492
- On which side were you, Monsieur?
- Starboard, I think.

667
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:02,745
So, if someone was on the port side,
you could not have seen them.

668
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:05,123
No, I suppose not.

669
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,333
Did anyone hear the shot,
appart from the steward?

670
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,793
I doubt it,

671
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,712
it sounded like a cork popping,
anyway.

672
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:13,506
Did you hear anything at all,
after retiring?

673
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:17,135
I think a heard a kind of ...splash,
just as I was dropping--

674
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:18,761
What time would that be?

675
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:21,222
What's the French for
''third degree''?

676
00:50:22,306 --> 00:50:26,102
- Just answer the question.
- 1 h? 12:55? 1:05?

677
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:28,312
Who knows?
Now, would that be all?

678
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,066
Hm? Oh-- yes?
Thank you, <i>Monsieur</i>, for your help.

679
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:35,987
By the way...

680
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,202
- Who exactly are you?
- What a damn fool question!

681
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:46,330
Heat's getting too much for you,
is it?

682
00:50:46,456 --> 00:50:49,542
Hm? No, but thank you
for your concern.

683
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:54,505
What a fightfully rude young man!

684
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,215
Oh, one thing more, <i>Mademoiselle...</i>

685
00:50:56,257 --> 00:50:58,301
had you ever met <i>Madame</i> Doyle
before this trip?

686
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,597
- No. Never.
- Merci.

687
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:05,725
Good day.

688
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,854
I-I didn't do it,
you must believe me.

689
00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:14,942
I was in such a state, I could
have killed Simon, but I didn't do it.

690
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,361
There, there...

691
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,363
We know , <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

692
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:22,325
- You do?
- Oh yes, it is proved, <i>mon enfant,</i>

693
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,744
it was not you.

694
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:28,039
Oh! Thank God for that!

695
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:31,751
- So, who was it?
- Ah! That is where we need help.

696
00:51:33,294 --> 00:51:36,589
I can't think of anyone
who wanted her dead, except for me.

697
00:51:37,256 --> 00:51:40,301
I wanted her dead,
and she is dead.

698
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:44,681
- And she died just like I said.
- <i>Oui</i>. Shot through the head.

699
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:52,855
See? I was right. There was someone
listening that night, at the hotel.

700
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,776
- Who could it have been?
- Are you certain it was a man?

701
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:02,281
No, I just assumed.

702
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:04,617
<i>Entrez.</i>

703
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:08,496
- Doyle is ready to see you now.
- Is he alright?

704
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:12,208
Of course he's not alright,
you shot him.

705
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:15,128
He's not going to die, is he?

706
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:17,380
He has the constitution of a peasant.

707
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:21,676
We will get him to civilization,
where he'll have an x-ray and proper treatment.

708
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:30,101
We now know that it was not <i>Jacqueline
de Bellefort</i> who shot your wife,

709
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:32,729
so, can you give to us any idea

710
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,064
of who you think that might have been?

711
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:41,362
Did she have any enemies
or someone who bore against her the grudge?

712
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:45,742
You see, Monsieur Doyle,

713
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,164
on the first day of the cruise, I had
a little encounter with your wife.

714
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:55,793
She was upset.
She said that everybody,

715
00:52:58,171 --> 00:53:01,716
everybody, mark you, hated her
and she was surrounded by enemies.

716
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:04,177
Now, she was exaggerating,

717
00:53:04,218 --> 00:53:06,971
but she did mean
more than one person.

718
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,517
There was a name,
on the passenger list...

719
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:16,689
- So, what name was that?
- She did next to tell me.

720
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:21,319
You see, her father
played the markets

721
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:24,405
several people got it in the neck.

722
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:28,076
Rolling in it one day,
and in the gutter the next.

723
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:32,163
Someone on board
whose father was one of those,

724
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:35,041
had it in for Linnet's old man.

725
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:41,798
She said how awful it was,
everyone hating her

726
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:44,634
without even knowing her.

727
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:48,262
She did not mention a name?

728
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,156
Tell me, <i>Mademoiselle Bourget,</i>

729
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,742
what time was it,
when you last saw alive your mistress?

730
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:12,662
- Sometime after midnight, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- And what then?

731
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:16,457
- Then I went to my cabin, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- You heard or saw anything?

732
00:54:16,624 --> 00:54:19,502
- How could I?
- Well, that is for you to say, Mademoiselle.

733
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,714
My cabin is on the deck below,
on the other side.

734
00:54:23,256 --> 00:54:25,591
It is not possible I should hear anything,

735
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:28,678
unless I could not sleep,

736
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:32,098
and came back up.
Then, perhaps I see something,

737
00:54:32,515 --> 00:54:35,852
this monster enter or leave
my mistress' cabin.

738
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,691
Then-- <i>Monsieur</i>, I implore you!
You know as it is... what can I say?

739
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:43,484
Calm down, for Heaven's sake!

740
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:48,823
It'll be alright.
I'll look after you.

741
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,159
Nobody's accusing you of anything.

742
00:54:52,452 --> 00:54:54,203
<i>Monsieur</i> is very good.

743
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:57,457
Do you know anyone who-- had a grudge
against your mistress?

744
00:54:57,623 --> 00:55:01,127
<i>Non, Monsieur</i>.
Everybody loved her.

745
00:55:01,335 --> 00:55:03,129
Tell me, <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle,

746
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:06,424
did your wife have with her, on this cruise
any jewelry that was valuable?

747
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:09,927
- The pearls.
- Do you know anything about these pearls?

748
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:13,056
- She was wearing them last night.
- But did you see them when you went to bed?

749
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:15,308
- Yes, <i>Monsieur</i>.
- And where she put them?

750
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,436
- On her bedside table.
- And where they this morning?

751
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,607
I did not see, because when
I come into the room

752
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:25,610
the only thing I notice was <i>Madame...</i>

753
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,863
... dead.
- <i>Oui bien, Mademoiselle</i>, but I did see

754
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:33,368
and there were no pearls
on her bedside table this morning.

755
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,287
<i>Merci.</i>

756
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:41,209
I think I heard a splash
and someone running.

757
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:43,127
Or was it the other way about?

758
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:46,881
- Do you know what time that was?
- An hour after I went to bed?

759
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:49,926
Or maybe more,
I can't be sure.

760
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:52,970
- Did you ever met <i>Madame</i> Doyle before?
- No,

761
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:57,225
but I'd heard a lot about her
through a relative of ours, Joanna Southwood.

762
00:55:57,517 --> 00:56:00,895
And through Tim, of course,
who had met her.

763
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:05,566
One more question, </i>Madame.

764
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:09,904
Did your family ever suffer
financially

765
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:12,031
with the dealings of the father
of Madame Doyle?

766
00:56:12,156 --> 00:56:16,577
No. The family finances never
suffered except by dwindling.

767
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:19,539
Our poverty has never been
melodramatic.

768
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,667
I was woken by lots of different voices,

769
00:56:22,834 --> 00:56:25,169
then somebody running
along the deck,

770
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:26,879
then a splash.

771
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,091
You sure it was not a shot
that you heard?

772
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,552
It might have been.

773
00:56:33,094 --> 00:56:35,138
I did hear a cork pop.

774
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,349
Perhaps that was the shot
and I imagined the splash.

775
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:42,311
You know, sort of association,
a cork popping, liquid splashing...

776
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:44,814
- And after that?
- Oblivion.

777
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:56,159
I heard somebody on the deck
and then a splash.

778
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:59,996
- Do you know what time this was?
- 01:10. I looked in my clock.

779
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:02,832
- You did not hear a shot?
- No, I did not.

780
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:06,127
Have you any idea
of what might have caused the splash?

781
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:07,920
- Oh, yes.
- You do?

782
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:10,048
I know exactly what it was.

783
00:57:10,715 --> 00:57:12,842
I went to the door of my cabin.

784
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:15,678
The daughter of that hedious woman
in the turban

785
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:21,434
was leaning over the rail,
she just dropped something into the water.

786
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:24,687
- You quite sure?
- Why else would I have said it?

787
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:28,358
- Yes?
- We've found it, Colonel.

788
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:37,867
Good job.

789
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:43,623
Is this the gun
you saw at the hotel?

790
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,043
Yes, it is.

791
00:57:50,546 --> 00:57:53,257
Two shots fired.
This must be the weapon.

792
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:56,260
What about my stole?
Look at the state of it!

793
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:58,346
Where did you last see this?

794
00:57:58,513 --> 00:58:01,057
- I had it in the lounge, yesterday evening.
- Please, do observe.

795
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:03,976
<i>Hélas!</i>

796
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:09,774
So, the murderer must have used this
as a silencer.

797
00:58:10,483 --> 00:58:12,276
The impertinence!

798
00:58:13,444 --> 00:58:16,489
Er... Miss Van Schuyler,
would you excuse us, please?

799
00:58:18,783 --> 00:58:22,412
Count Van Mecklamburg
will be most displeased.

800
00:58:30,795 --> 00:58:33,131
<i>Non, non</i>! It does not make sense!

801
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:38,720
If the murderer wishes us to believe
that <i>Jaqueline de Bellefort</i> is the culprit,

802
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:42,265
why throw the revolver,
the evidence the most accusing of all,

803
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,267
into the River Nile?

804
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:48,730
I told you, I never left my cabin.

805
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:51,649
Well, that is strange, <i>Mademoiselle</i>,
because someone said that saw you.

806
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:53,693
- Who?
- Mademoiselle Van Schuyler.

807
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:56,654
She looked outside her cabin,
and saw you throwing something over the side.

808
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:59,866
- And what else did she claim to have seen?
- Nothing,

809
00:59:00,992 --> 00:59:04,662
but she heard something: someone
moving about the cabin of <i>Madame Doyle.</i>

810
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:05,830
Of course, <i>mademoiselle,</i>

811
00:59:05,872 --> 00:59:07,540
there might be a reason
that is perfectly innocent

812
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:08,916
for throwing something overboard.

813
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,085
But, then again...

814
00:59:18,926 --> 00:59:21,387
- Is that what she was killed with?
- <i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

815
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,349
Hmm... And you think
that I might have done it?

816
00:59:24,515 --> 00:59:27,143
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Van Schuyler
is prepared to swear

817
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,645
that she saw you quite clearly
in the moonlight.

818
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,774
<i><b>It  wasn't me.</b></i>

819
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:37,278
I was dead to the world...

820
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:39,906
... like poor Madame Doyle
is now, in fact.

821
00:59:40,031 --> 00:59:43,034
A <i>crime passionnel,</i>
wouldn't you say, <i>Monsieur Poirot?</i>

822
00:59:43,576 --> 00:59:47,955
That girl, Jacqueline, half latin,
you know, creeping along the deck,

823
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:53,002
pistol in full cock.
Or Mr. Doyle, deranged by desire,

824
00:59:53,836 --> 00:59:56,422
lust pumping through his veins.

825
00:59:57,173 --> 01:00:01,552
Or perhaps Miss Robson,
the repressed virgin, tragically plain,

826
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:06,349
driven to distraction by the proximity
of honeymoon passion...

827
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:13,022
Tell me, <i>Monsieur</i> Pennington,
are you aware of anyone

828
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:14,982
who wished to see
Madame Doyle dead?

829
01:00:18,736 --> 01:00:22,573
Well, there is that Madam,
that Miss <i>de Bellefort</i>.

830
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:27,370
- Now, if looks could kill...
- Thank you for that, <i>Monsieur.</i>

831
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:32,208
You may, perhaps also recall that
<i>Madame</i> Doyle had a very near escape,

832
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,585
at the temple of Hathor.
- Well, I did hear about that,

833
01:00:36,421 --> 01:00:38,798
but I was inside the temple
at the time.

834
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:41,968
Mr. Doyle mentioned that
there was someone on board

835
01:00:42,093 --> 01:00:44,303
who bore a grudge against her family.

836
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:47,682
- Do you know who that could be?
- I'm afraid I don't.

837
01:00:47,807 --> 01:00:50,518
No business dealings of her father
that might have resulted

838
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:53,521
in ruin for some rival?

839
01:00:54,397 --> 01:00:56,566
Not that I am aware of, no.

840
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:12,248
So, why should the murderer
take the stole before the event?

841
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:15,585
After all, nobody knew that
<i>Mademoiselle de Bellefort</i>

842
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,212
<i>et Monsieur Doyle</i>
were going to... have a scene.

843
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:22,133
Perhaps he found it
when he went in to get the pistol.

844
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:25,178
Why was it not discovered
when the search for it was made?

845
01:01:26,095 --> 01:01:28,598
<i>Non, non, my friend,
it makes no sense.</i>

846
01:01:29,724 --> 01:01:32,143
Well, don't be downhearted.
We'll get to the bottom of it.

847
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:33,978
Oh, I know I will!

848
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:40,276
Doyle has asked if he may see
Mademoiselle de Bellefort.

849
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:43,988
<i>- Oui, I will bring her to him.
- Very good.</i>

850
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,537
Did you know that Monsieur Pennington
told to us a lie?

851
01:01:51,662 --> 01:01:52,872
Did he?

852
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,918
He said that he was in the temple
when the statuette fell. He was not.

853
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,837
I had just come from there myself.

854
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:08,304
Come in.

855
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:18,147
I thought you might be worrying,

856
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:20,942
and I wanted you to know that it's--
it's alright.

857
01:02:23,152 --> 01:02:25,279
I behaved absolutely rotten
to you.

858
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:29,534
Oh! Simon, I'm so sorry...

859
01:02:31,285 --> 01:02:33,454
I'm so sorry...

860
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:48,469
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

861
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,804
You know I need it!

862
01:02:49,971 --> 01:02:51,889
- It's for your own good, mother.
- Ungrateful wretch!

863
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:54,684
- Have you any idea how I suffer?
- You don't let me forget!

864
01:02:57,437 --> 01:03:00,231
Mademoiselle,
may I have a few words?

865
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,943
I won't "beat about the bushes",

866
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:06,446
<i>but your mother, she drinks,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

867
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:08,740
No need for you to talk.

868
01:03:09,073 --> 01:03:10,992
When I first met you,
I saw at once

869
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:12,994
that you were protecting her
from something

870
01:03:13,578 --> 01:03:15,747
and soon I discovered
what that something was.

871
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:19,292
The secret drinker, with the secret
cunning of the drunken,

872
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:21,502
had a secret supply hidden away.

873
01:03:22,128 --> 01:03:24,338
I believe that you yesterday discovered
her supply

874
01:03:24,756 --> 01:03:27,342
and, while your mother was
sound asleep,

875
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:30,803
you threw overboard the bottles.
I am right, am I not?

876
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:33,681
It all began when her books
stopped selling

877
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:35,558
and that hurt her dreadfully.

878
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,977
She made a complete fool of herself,

879
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:40,480
it was awful.

880
01:03:40,938 --> 01:03:45,068
I had to keep my eye on her all the time.
And she began to hate me.

881
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:48,488
<i>- Pauvre petite.
- Don't pity me, for God's sake!</i>

882
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:54,786
I know people think
I'm stuck-up, bad tempered,

883
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:57,830
but the truth is, I forgot
how to be nice.

884
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,794
You won't tell anyone, will you?

885
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:07,548
<i>Non, but now I need you to tell me
what I need to know.</i>

886
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:11,594
At what time did you throw
overboard the bottles?

887
01:04:11,928 --> 01:04:15,223
- At 01:10, perhaps?
- About that, yes.

888
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,225
As I have already told you,

889
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:20,019
Mademoiselle Van Schuyler
saw you from her cabin door.

890
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:22,146
Now you tell me: did you see her?

891
01:04:22,689 --> 01:04:26,651
No, I didn't. I looked along the deck,
out to the river.

892
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:29,529
But did you see anyone,
when you looked along the deck?

893
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:31,656
Anyone at all?

894
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:34,617
No, I saw nobody.

895
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:37,954
<i>Merci.</i>

896
01:05:03,104 --> 01:05:04,188
Stolen?

897
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:07,650
- I'm afraid it is so, Madame.
- Those beautiful pearls!

898
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,487
Remember that party
at the Portarlington's,

899
01:05:11,612 --> 01:05:13,489
when poor Lady Hooper's diamonds
were stolen?

900
01:05:13,614 --> 01:05:16,242
The Police gave you
quite a grilling.

901
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:28,087
Poor child!
She looks dreadfully unhappy.

902
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:30,673
Well, she shouldn't go around
shooting people.

903
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:33,217
I mean, who does she think she is,
Annie Oakley?

904
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:36,888
French have blood on their hands,
we have blood on our hands

905
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,349
and one day we'll all pay for all
dearly, I tell you!

906
01:05:39,515 --> 01:05:41,392
Yeah, and I tell you
to shut up and eat!

907
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:43,603
Why couldn't you wait for me?

908
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:45,855
I had something to do.

909
01:05:46,022 --> 01:05:48,608
I remember reading
about the diamonds of Lady Hooper.

910
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:52,028
Well... As usual, mother has got
the whole thing hopelessly wrong.

911
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,032
I wasn't there when they're actually
stolen, just when it was discovered

912
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:59,702
that the old bag was wearing
paste around her fat neck.

913
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:05,124
Some say she was in on it
herself.

914
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:09,212
- Joanna, no doubt.
- Joanna wasn't there, mother.

915
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,922
If I may have your attention...

916
01:06:12,674 --> 01:06:16,260
It's come to our notice that
a valuable string of pearls,

917
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:18,554
belonging to the late Mrs. Doyle,
is gone missing.

918
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,847
What?

919
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:22,100
A search in the boat is just about
to take place.

920
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:25,228
I'd be grateful if you would all
remain here until it's completed.

921
01:06:25,353 --> 01:06:27,105
And thereafter, I'd be most grateful

922
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:29,899
if you'd all submit yourselves
to a search.

923
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:43,079
Sir, there is a lady that says
it's urgent

924
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:45,039
she speak to you.

925
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:48,626
- Bring her in.
- Please.

926
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,297
<i>- Miss Robson.
-  Mademoiselle.</i>

927
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:55,091
What can we do for you?

928
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,143
- You took them?
- No, I didn't. Cousin Marie did.

929
01:07:06,394 --> 01:07:09,022
<i>- Mademoiselle Van Schuyler?
- She can't help it.</i>

930
01:07:09,147 --> 01:07:10,398
It's her little idiosyncrasy.

931
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,109
That's why I'm here,
to keep an eye on her.

932
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:17,238
- Where did you find them?
- They were on her stokings,this morning.

933
01:07:17,864 --> 01:07:21,451
That's where she usually hides things.
I knew whose they were, of course,

934
01:07:21,826 --> 01:07:23,578
so I went along to return them,

935
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:26,080
<i>but there was a steward en garde,
who told me about the murder.</i>

936
01:07:26,372 --> 01:07:28,124
I've been in absolute stale all morning.

937
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,918
The Van Schuylers, you see,
are very particular.

938
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:34,339
I mean, it would never do
if this got into the papers.

939
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:37,300
- But it won't, will it?
- Well, it depends, Miss Robson.

940
01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:38,885
<i>Non, non, non, non, non...</i>

941
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:42,096
<i>We shall do our very best for you,
of course, Mademoiselle.</i>

942
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:44,682
- Thank you so much.
- Please.

943
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:46,601
<i>Thank you, Monsieur...</i>

944
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:54,609
Poirot.

945
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:10,041
Imitation, my friend.

946
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:13,586
Now we begin our search
for the real thing.

947
01:08:15,088 --> 01:08:17,548
I doubt we will find them
in Mrs. Doyle's cabin.

948
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:20,301
We never know what
we might find, Colonel.

949
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:46,994
''Das Kapital''...
Conrad Ferguson is a bolschie.

950
01:08:49,205 --> 01:08:51,916
I always knew there was
something fishy about the chap.

951
01:09:04,178 --> 01:09:06,514
A bolschie is not all that he is...

952
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:10,685
Monsieur Allerton, it would seem,
is most religious.

953
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:20,319
The glue... Now, what would he
want with this, I wonder?

954
01:09:22,822 --> 01:09:24,365
Well, I dunno...

955
01:09:36,335 --> 01:09:39,422
<i>Monsieur Pennington.
S.S. Normandie.</i>

956
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:45,094
Poirot.

957
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:01,235
The passengers have been
searched, sir.

958
01:10:01,402 --> 01:10:03,237
- And...?
- Nothing,

959
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:05,782
except for Miss Rosalie Otterbourne,

960
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:09,118
there was a small revolver
in her handbag.

961
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:12,038
- So, how did she react?
- She did not notice.

962
01:10:12,163 --> 01:10:14,791
I had my back turned to her,
at the time.

963
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,835
And still there is one person
we have not searched.

964
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,421
- Who's that?
- The maid, Louise Bourget.

965
01:10:20,588 --> 01:10:22,924
We can not find her
anywhere.

966
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,655
Dead not more than an hour.
Instantaneous.

967
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:47,699
Stabbed through the heart.

968
01:10:48,116 --> 01:10:49,450
With what?

969
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:51,160
With something like this.

970
01:10:51,285 --> 01:10:53,621
I supose that none of your knives
is missing.

971
01:10:53,746 --> 01:10:56,040
<i>Do you think I would kill a little
miserable femme de chambre?</i>

972
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:57,583
No, I just wondered...

973
01:10:58,126 --> 01:11:00,378
All my knives are
present and correct.

974
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:01,713
Good, good.

975
01:11:01,838 --> 01:11:03,923
Well, now if you'll excuse me...

976
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:13,725
She was holding this.

977
01:11:14,017 --> 01:11:16,060
It's the corner of
one thousand franc note.

978
01:11:16,519 --> 01:11:18,646
What did she say
when we questioned her?

979
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:23,192
''It is not possible that I should
hear anything,

980
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,736
"unless I could not sleep

981
01:11:24,777 --> 01:11:27,655
''and came back up.
Then perhaps I see something,

982
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:31,409
''this monster enter or leave
my mistresse's cabin.''

983
01:11:31,576 --> 01:11:34,454
This is exactly what happenned!
She did return to the top deck.

984
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:36,748
She did someone enter
or leave the cabin.

985
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:38,708
- Blackmail.
- Yes. So the murdered enters,

986
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,794
gives to her the money,
and, while she is counting it...

987
01:11:52,764 --> 01:11:54,932
<i>You talk the scandal,
mesdemoiselles?</i>

988
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:57,101
We were just comparing lipsticks.

989
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:02,648
<i>- What's wrong, Monsieur Poirot?
- The maid of Madame Doyle</i>

990
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:06,194
she has been killed.
- Louise?

991
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:08,905
She saw something she was not
meant to see.

992
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:10,365
What?

993
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,409
Someone enter or leave the cabin
of Madame Doyle last night.

994
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:14,827
Did she say who?

995
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:16,662
Miss Jacqueline, if you please,
do excuse us.

996
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:18,039
Oh! Of course.

997
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:33,388
- Why did you not tell me the truth?
- I have.

998
01:12:33,513 --> 01:12:36,891
<i>Non, you did not tell me everything
you saw last night.</i>

999
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:39,769
And you did not tell me that you have
in your handbag, the little revolver.

1000
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:41,521
I don't!

1001
01:13:03,209 --> 01:13:05,420
- I want the truth!
- And what is the truth?

1002
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:08,214
That you saw last night someone come out
of the cabin of Linnet Doyle.

1003
01:13:08,339 --> 01:13:10,133
I'm right, am I not, Mademoiselle?

1004
01:13:10,258 --> 01:13:12,427
I've told you I saw no one!

1005
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:39,662
You're not thinking of jumping in,
are you, old chap?

1006
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:41,664
Why would I want to do that,

1007
01:13:42,206 --> 01:13:44,876
just when things begin to
fall into place?

1008
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:50,089
Just a few questions,
that is all, Doctor.

1009
01:13:52,592 --> 01:13:55,470
I'll return in three minutes,
then positively you go.

1010
01:13:55,762 --> 01:13:57,180
<i>Merci.</i>

1011
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:03,311
<i>I will not detain you for long,
Monsieur Doyle.</i>

1012
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:04,729
So, what is it?

1013
01:14:04,854 --> 01:14:07,190
<i>Monsieur Poirot!
Monsieur Poirot!</i>

1014
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:10,818
Monsieur Poirot, I must speak with you,

1015
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:12,570
I have vital information!

1016
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:16,783
- I know who killed Linnet Doyle!
- What?

1017
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:20,703
<i>- Yes, and I have evidence to prove it!
- S'il vous plaît, Madame.</i>

1018
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:24,499
<i>Merci. My theories
about primeval urges</i>

1019
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:26,918
are completely justified.

1020
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:30,338
You will agree that
whoever killed Louise,

1021
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:33,549
what's her name,
also killed Linnet Doyle?

1022
01:14:34,384 --> 01:14:36,511
I saw the person
with my own eyes.

1023
01:14:36,636 --> 01:14:38,638
You saw the person
who killed my wife?

1024
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,348
It was just before lunch.

1025
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,642
I had an arrangement with
one of the "ship's personnel"

1026
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:45,228
to get me...
something I needed,

1027
01:14:45,395 --> 01:14:47,146
we were to meet on the
lower deck.

1028
01:14:47,522 --> 01:14:49,941
As I walked along,
a cabin door opened

1029
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:53,695
and this girl, Louise...
Budget?...

1030
01:14:53,695 --> 01:14:55,613
popped her head out.

1031
01:14:55,738 --> 01:14:58,074
I think she was expecting someone,
but when she saw it was me,

1032
01:14:58,074 --> 01:15:00,034
she darted back inside.

1033
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:02,870
I thought nothing of it,
of course went along,

1034
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:06,124
got the-- from the man, and started
back. Just as I did,

1035
01:15:06,249 --> 01:15:10,795
I saw someone knock on the...
maids door and go inside!

1036
01:15:12,338 --> 01:15:13,631
Yes?

1037
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:15,425
Yes!

1038
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,302
- But who was it?
- Didn't I say?

1039
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,180
It was...

1040
01:15:32,984 --> 01:15:34,193
What the devil was that?

1041
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:36,070
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

1042
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:40,116
That's Pennington's gun.
I saw him cleaning it the other day.

1043
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:48,583
So, how do you account
for your gun being used?

1044
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,793
- I have no idea.
- Was anybody aware that you had one?

1045
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:52,378
I made no secret of it.

1046
01:15:52,545 --> 01:15:53,796
Tell me, Monsieur Pennington,

1047
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:56,591
Linnet Doyle was not yet
of age when she married, yes?

1048
01:15:56,716 --> 01:15:58,343
She would turn 21 next July.

1049
01:15:58,468 --> 01:16:00,386
Which is when she would have
taken control of her fortune?

1050
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:02,180
According of her father's will,

1051
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:05,016
Linnet was to take control over the dowry
when she turned 21

1052
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:06,476
or when she married.

1053
01:16:06,601 --> 01:16:09,270
And did this marriage, that was so sudden,
cause you any consternation?

1054
01:16:09,687 --> 01:16:11,397
- Why should it?
- Perhaps because her affairs

1055
01:16:11,522 --> 01:16:13,775
weren't in the perfect order
that they should be.

1056
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,276
- What are you suggesting?
- Which she would have noticed

1057
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:17,445
when she took control
on her return to England.

1058
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,781
And that prospect so alarmed you,
- did it not? - that you rushed over

1059
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:23,451
and arranjed for a meeting that was
apparently fortuitous in Cairo?

1060
01:16:23,618 --> 01:16:27,121
I did not! Her letter arrived a day
after I sailed on the Carmanic.

1061
01:16:27,246 --> 01:16:28,748
Then why did you,
on your luggage,

1062
01:16:28,873 --> 01:16:31,376
you have only the labels of the Normandie,
that sailed two days later?

1063
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:35,129
<i>Non, Mr. Paddington. It is the easiest thing
in the world to check the list of passengers.</i>

1064
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:38,800
I believe that you came over here
to find a way out of the mess you were in

1065
01:16:38,925 --> 01:16:40,760
and endeavored, without success,

1066
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:43,054
to obtain the signature of Mme. Doyle
to certain documents.

1067
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:45,682
And while you were walking along the roof
of the Temple of Hathor,

1068
01:16:45,807 --> 01:16:48,810
you dislodged a statue head, which fell
very close to it's objective...

1069
01:16:48,935 --> 01:16:51,104
- That is crazy!
- And when a similar opportunity

1070
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:53,064
presented itself on the return
journey home,

1071
01:16:53,564 --> 01:16:56,275
when her death would, almost certainly,
be described to somebody else,

1072
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:58,277
not forgetting the fact, irrefutable,

1073
01:16:58,444 --> 01:17:00,822
that it was your gun that was used
to shoot and kill

1074
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:03,616
a woman that was about to reveal
the identity of the murderer.

1075
01:17:03,741 --> 01:17:05,743
Three murders, Monsieur Pennington!

1076
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:08,663
You may rest assured that the authorities
will conduct an investigation

1077
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:11,374
that wil be most thorough to the
condition of the estate of Madame Doyle.

1078
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:12,750
All right!

1079
01:17:15,503 --> 01:17:20,425
It's because of this goddamn slum.
I was hoping that, with a little bit of luck,

1080
01:17:20,591 --> 01:17:24,095
I would have straightened everything up
by the time she would take control.

1081
01:17:24,262 --> 01:17:27,265
And the statue head was what?
Was it an oportunity too tempting?

1082
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:30,101
It was an accident! I tripped
over my golf club.

1083
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,025
And I didn't kill her either!

1084
01:17:37,859 --> 01:17:39,235
Do you hear me?

1085
01:17:39,402 --> 01:17:42,613
You're not gonna pin that on me,
and you never will.

1086
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:55,626
A spoiled brat, a domestic parasite
and a drunken old bag,

1087
01:17:55,752 --> 01:17:57,545
who cares wether they're dead
or not?

1088
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,797
You really are the rudest man...

1089
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:02,425
It's the future that matters, woman,
not the past.

1090
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,345
Have you ever considered, for a single
second, that somebody, somewhere,

1091
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:09,432
might be grieving by the poor maid
or how distraught Rosalie might be?

1092
01:18:09,766 --> 01:18:12,852
And as for Linnet Doyle,
well, she was just so beautiful...

1093
01:18:14,645 --> 01:18:16,022
Ah! Unbelievable, isn't it?

1094
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:19,567
Did you know that Cornelia's father
was pratically ruined

1095
01:18:19,734 --> 01:18:20,985
by Linnet's old man

1096
01:18:21,152 --> 01:18:24,238
and all she say is how beautiful
she was. Incredible!

1097
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,450
I thought you said it's the future
that mattered, not the past.

1098
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:29,202
<i>Touché.</i>

1099
01:18:33,873 --> 01:18:35,375
Will you marry me?

1100
01:18:37,126 --> 01:18:39,587
- What?!
- It goes against all my principles,

1101
01:18:39,754 --> 01:18:42,090
I know, but I really think you should.
How about it?

1102
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:44,759
It's a disgusting idea.

1103
01:18:45,802 --> 01:18:47,345
Is that a ''No''?

1104
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,972
You are opinionated, unreliable,

1105
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:52,058
scrubby, unpleasant

1106
01:18:52,266 --> 01:18:54,936
and utterly...
utterly irritating.

1107
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,814
- But apart from that...
- You see?

1108
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:06,906
Definitley smitten, I say. I think
I'll have a word with the old crow!

1109
01:19:08,032 --> 01:19:09,575
Quite a filled day for you, isn't it?

1110
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:11,494
Everybody dropping like flies!

1111
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,584
Good afternoon.

1112
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:21,337
To come straight to the point,
I want to marry your cousin.

1113
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:23,798
In fact, I've already asked her.
Unfortunately, she declined,

1114
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:25,216
but don't worry,

1115
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:27,051
I'll keep on her turn, until
she says yes.

1116
01:19:27,176 --> 01:19:30,304
I can assure, sir,
I shall take steps to see

1117
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:33,808
that she's not be subjected
to such persecution.

1118
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,102
What exactly do you have against me?

1119
01:19:36,436 --> 01:19:39,689
I'm not that bad, you see.
Anatomically, everything's in the right place,

1120
01:19:39,814 --> 01:19:42,275
it's in perfect working order
and I'm really quite bright,

1121
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,609
so what seems to be the problem?

1122
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:46,487
- Social position, Mr. Ferguson.
- Oh, I see.

1123
01:19:47,697 --> 01:19:52,452
Cornelia, come here. Have you been
behaving wrongly with this young man?

1124
01:19:52,785 --> 01:19:55,079
No! No, of course not...

1125
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:57,457
Your cousin says
that I'm not good enough for you.

1126
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,125
In the natural order of things,

1127
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:01,377
she thinks that I'm the equivalent
of pond life.

1128
01:20:01,544 --> 01:20:03,755
- Is that how you see me?
- It's not that.

1129
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:07,091
- It's-- It's...?
- Yes...?

1130
01:20:14,891 --> 01:20:16,684
Isn't she wonderful?

1131
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:25,318
Rather eccentric, I'm afraid,
like most of his family.

1132
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:29,280
Well, he refuses to wear his title
because of his ideas progressive.

1133
01:20:29,405 --> 01:20:34,452
<i>- Title?
- Oui, Lord Dawlish. You did not know?</i>

1134
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:38,539
Oh, he is, how do you say it,
rolling in money, of course,

1135
01:20:38,664 --> 01:20:41,042
but he became a communiste on Oxford.

1136
01:20:41,459 --> 01:20:44,253
Lord... Dawlish?

1137
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,339
I recognised him
from a picture on the paper,

1138
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:47,799
then I discovered the signet ring,

1139
01:20:48,132 --> 01:20:49,717
with the Dawlish coat of arms
on it.

1140
01:20:49,842 --> 01:20:51,636
There can be no doubt,
I assure you!

1141
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:56,099
I am very much obliged to you,
Monsieur Poirot.

1142
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:01,729
Ah! Monsieur Allerton,

1143
01:21:01,896 --> 01:21:03,940
I would like very much
to have a little word with you.

1144
01:21:04,065 --> 01:21:06,818
- What can I do for you?
- There's nothing you can do for me, Monsieur,

1145
01:21:06,984 --> 01:21:09,570
but to sit and to listen.
- Right... well,

1146
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:11,989
I'm very good at that.

1147
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:16,619
You can rely on me to say
''Whoa!'' on the right moments.

1148
01:21:16,953 --> 01:21:20,206
''Whoa!'' will do nicely.
Thank you.

1149
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,584
<i>Merci.</i>

1150
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:29,924
So, to begin, your friendship
with your cousin, Joanna Southwood.

1151
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:38,182
For the past three years, Scotland Yard
has been preoccupied

1152
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:40,393
with a number of jewelry robberies.

1153
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:44,147
And we know that the method
has been always the same.

1154
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,607
<i>Oui, the substitution of the original
with an imitation.</i>

1155
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:49,777
Atention soon focused
on Mademoiselle Southwood.

1156
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:54,449
You see, everyone of the victims
had been either a friend or an acquaintance.

1157
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:59,078
It also became clear that she did not
make the substitution herself.

1158
01:21:59,203 --> 01:22:00,955
<i>Non, non, non. She had a jeweler
who made a copy</i>

1159
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:03,207
and the substitution would be made
by someone else.

1160
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:07,712
But the identity of this person
has remained a mistery.

1161
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:11,591
<i>- Whoa!
- Oui.</i>

1162
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:13,301
But over the past few days,
certain facts have emerged,

1163
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:15,386
that have been most helpful.

1164
01:22:15,803 --> 01:22:18,473
Your attendance at the house party
where had one of such robbery occurred,

1165
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:21,225
your obvious resentments
of my presence here,

1166
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:25,646
and the discovery that the pearls belonging
to Linnet Doyle were missing.

1167
01:22:25,813 --> 01:22:28,024
But what do I find?

1168
01:22:29,692 --> 01:22:32,153
I find that the pearls that were
stolen and returned

1169
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:33,696
were an imitation,

1170
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:36,949
previously substituted for
the real thing.

1171
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,952
It would have been easy to Mademoiselle
Southwood find an oportunity

1172
01:22:40,078 --> 01:22:44,248
to examine the pearls of her friend
and to have made a copy.

1173
01:22:44,707 --> 01:22:47,293
And it was then just a question
of waiting for the right moment

1174
01:22:47,418 --> 01:22:49,879
for you to make the substitution.

1175
01:22:50,713 --> 01:22:53,841
<i>Et bien! But you learned that Linnet Doyle
was to honeymoon in Egypt, so hum!?...</i>

1176
01:22:53,966 --> 01:22:55,677
<i>Parfait, hein?</i>

1177
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:58,888
Mademoiselle Southwood
sent you the imitation,

1178
01:22:59,222 --> 01:23:01,683
concealed, I suggest in a packet
of books,

1179
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,144
to you then, find your time.

1180
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:07,438
Finally, you made the substitution,

1181
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:10,441
returned to your cabin...

1182
01:23:11,275 --> 01:23:14,445
... and concealed them by gluying them
into a rosary.

1183
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,200
unfortunately for you, the night you chose
to do the did

1184
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:21,285
was the same night
when Linnet Doyle was murdered.

1185
01:23:21,411 --> 01:23:25,123
But more unfortunately was the fact
that someone saw you leave her cabin.

1186
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:30,795
"Whoa!", would you not say,
Monsieur Allerton?

1187
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:35,967
- Who saw me?
- Mademoiselle Rosalie Otterbourne.

1188
01:23:36,092 --> 01:23:38,886
<i>- And she told you?
- Non. In fact, when I taxed her with it,</i>

1189
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:41,222
she lied.
- Why?

1190
01:23:43,433 --> 01:23:45,810
Perhaps because she thought the man
she saw

1191
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:48,312
was the murderer.

1192
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:52,525
Surely, not thinking that...

1193
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:55,528
Was Madame Doyle alive or dead
when you stole the pearls?

1194
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:59,699
I don't know. I... really don't know.

1195
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:01,451
Could you hear her breathing?

1196
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:04,871
I--I couldn't say.

1197
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:07,582
Now listen, you young twerp,

1198
01:24:07,749 --> 01:24:11,627
Monsieur Poirot here, can build
a case against you, that's so rock solid

1199
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:14,005
that you'll be hanging
from some gallows

1200
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:16,090
before you can even draw
a breath to say "False!".

1201
01:24:17,216 --> 01:24:20,636
I didn't murder anyone! I admit
I substituted the pearls,

1202
01:24:20,845 --> 01:24:23,598
but murder no! I swear!

1203
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:27,143
It would make a very good case,
I assure you.

1204
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:32,398
I suggest that, when I examine
the rosary, I will find nothing there,

1205
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,026
and, since
Mademoiselle Otterbourne

1206
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:36,444
asserts on saying
that she saw no one

1207
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:39,113
on the deck last night,
for this particular theft,

1208
01:24:39,238 --> 01:24:41,991
there is no case against you.

1209
01:24:42,617 --> 01:24:46,621
The pearls were taken
by a cleptomaniac

1210
01:24:47,538 --> 01:24:50,124
who has since returned.

1211
01:24:53,544 --> 01:24:55,171
I... don't know what to say, Mr. P.

1212
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,466
Under the circumstances,
Mr. A,

1213
01:25:00,218 --> 01:25:02,679
I will suggest that this is not
a bad thing.

1214
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:14,565
So that's that.

1215
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:17,777
Now all I have to do is return
the real thing to Mr. Poirot.

1216
01:25:18,986 --> 01:25:22,990
- Why didn't you say you'd seen me?
- I thought they might suspect you.

1217
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,577
- Did you suspect me?
- No.

1218
01:25:27,412 --> 01:25:31,374
- I knew you couldn't kill anyone.
- A miserable little thief, that's all I am.

1219
01:25:48,599 --> 01:25:51,352
Barking up the wrong tree,
I'm afraid.

1220
01:25:53,062 --> 01:25:54,689
Timothy...

1221
01:26:15,793 --> 01:26:17,086
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

1222
01:26:17,295 --> 01:26:18,588
<i>Messieurs,</i>

1223
01:26:18,755 --> 01:26:20,340
I am pleased to inform you

1224
01:26:20,465 --> 01:26:23,259
that the picture,
it is finally complete.

1225
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:24,844
<i>Et bien, where to begin?</i>

1226
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,348
You know, our big mistake,

1227
01:26:28,473 --> 01:26:30,641
and unbelievable that
I should go along with it,

1228
01:26:31,184 --> 01:26:34,187
was to suppose that this crime was
spontaneous. Not so.

1229
01:26:34,312 --> 01:26:37,106
It was worked out meticulously
in every detail,

1230
01:26:37,231 --> 01:26:43,112
even to the drugging of
the bottle of wine of Hercule Poirot!

1231
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,324
I was put to sleep, so there
should be no possibility of participating

1232
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:49,160
in the events of the night.

1233
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:52,163
Nothing easier than to place
a narcotic into my bottle,

1234
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:54,248
which stands on the table
of the dining room.

1235
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:59,962
<i>And my sleepinness...  Et bien,
it had been a hot day.</i>

1236
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:04,926
The drugging of the wine, it had
to take place before dinner, at 19:30,

1237
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:06,928
but, you know, even then,

1238
01:27:06,969 --> 01:27:09,806
premeditation was very far
from my mind.

1239
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,768
The first blow
to our preconceived idea

1240
01:27:14,977 --> 01:27:17,939
was when the revolver
was recovered from the River Nile.

1241
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,524
If we had been correct,

1242
01:27:19,565 --> 01:27:22,360
the revolver would never have been
thrown overboard.

1243
01:27:22,735 --> 01:27:25,530
Also the stole which was wrapped
around the pistol

1244
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:28,032
showed the signs
that it had been fired through,

1245
01:27:28,157 --> 01:27:31,452
but the bullet wounds
showed signs of scorching.

1246
01:27:31,744 --> 01:27:35,123
Which is to say the revolver had
been placed against her head

1247
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:38,167
and we knew the stole was not
used against you, Monsieur Doyle,

1248
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,336
because there are two witnesses
to prove it.

1249
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:44,966
Therefore, a third shot must have been
fired, about which we knew nothing.

1250
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:49,679
Next came the two bottles.

1251
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:53,224
Madame Doyle always painted
her nails ''Cardinal'',

1252
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:55,518
a red color that was deep
and dark.

1253
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:58,396
The other bottle was ''Rose'',
a shade of pink.

1254
01:27:58,563 --> 01:28:01,941
But the few drops that were remaining
were bright red

1255
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:05,069
and, instead of the usual odor
of pale drops,

1256
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,989
this bottle smelled of ink.

1257
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:10,158
This linked it with
the handkerchief

1258
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:11,701
that was also stained
bright red,

1259
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:14,037
and wrapped around the revolver.

1260
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:17,332
Then an event ocurred which
rended all the doubts superfluous.

1261
01:28:17,498 --> 01:28:21,252
When I asked Louise Bourget,
the maid, if she'd seen anything, she said.:

1262
01:28:21,502 --> 01:28:23,838
It is not possible
I should hear anything,

1263
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:28,468
unless I could not sleep
and came back up.

1264
01:28:28,885 --> 01:28:31,929
Then perhaps I see something,

1265
01:28:32,722 --> 01:28:37,352
this... monster enter or leave
my mistress's cabin.

1266
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:39,479
But why say all this to us?

1267
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:42,940
If she knew who was the murderer,
why not tell it to us,

1268
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:48,488
or hold her tongue and
demand money from the guilty person?

1269
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:50,573
But she does neither.
Why?

1270
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,951
There could only be one reason,

1271
01:28:55,244 --> 01:28:58,331
because she was hinting
to the murderer.

1272
01:28:59,582 --> 01:29:02,502
Therefore, the murderer
must have been present.

1273
01:29:07,965 --> 01:29:09,384
Oh! You're accusing me?

1274
01:29:09,509 --> 01:29:12,011
But why would you kill her, Dr. Bessner?
And you, Monsieur Doyle?

1275
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,389
There are witnesses to swear that
you didn't leave the lounge

1276
01:29:14,389 --> 01:29:15,890
before the quarrel broke out,

1277
01:29:16,015 --> 01:29:18,518
and then you were wounded in the leg,
making it physically impossible.

1278
01:29:18,685 --> 01:29:20,812
So no, Dr. Bessner
must be the guilty one,

1279
01:29:20,978 --> 01:29:24,315
but... why should Louise, the maid,
be hinting to Dr. Bessner?

1280
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:26,693
She could have spoken to him
any time she wanted.

1281
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:28,945
<i>So... non! There was one person,
and one person only,</i>

1282
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,656
who corresponded to her necessity.

1283
01:29:35,076 --> 01:29:36,828
Simon Doyle!

1284
01:29:41,582 --> 01:29:43,251
I say!

1285
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:48,589
Poppycock (nonsense)!
Absolute poppycock!

1286
01:29:49,257 --> 01:29:52,552
You were constantly attended to,
she might not have another chance.

1287
01:29:52,677 --> 01:29:56,806
Monsieur, I implore you!
You know how it is... What can I say?

1288
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:58,599
Calm down, for Heaven's sake!

1289
01:29:58,725 --> 01:30:01,185
You'll be alright.
I'll look after you.

1290
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:04,814
And that was the assurance that
she wanted and she got it.

1291
01:30:04,939 --> 01:30:07,775
- Impossible! The man could not move!
- Exactly!

1292
01:30:08,234 --> 01:30:11,446
- This is an outrage!
- But what had actually been seen?

1293
01:30:11,946 --> 01:30:13,364
Miss de Bellefort!

1294
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:16,242
I'll shoot you like a dog!
Like the dirty dog that you are!

1295
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:18,786
Mr. Ferguson! Mr. Ferguson!

1296
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:31,007
And what then?

1297
01:30:31,174 --> 01:30:33,217
Get her out of here, for God's sake!
Take her to her cabin!

1298
01:30:33,343 --> 01:30:35,345
And don't let her be left alone,
whatever you do!

1299
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,597
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Doyle!
I'll stay with her.

1300
01:30:37,722 --> 01:30:39,557
And get Dr. Bessner
to take care of me.

1301
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:41,684
But all of these cabins
were on the port side.

1302
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:43,978
The cabin of your wife,
Monsieur Doyle,

1303
01:30:44,145 --> 01:30:45,897
it was on the starboard side.

1304
01:30:46,064 --> 01:30:47,899
So, this was your only chance

1305
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:50,610
and a few minutes were
all that you needed.

1306
01:30:50,943 --> 01:30:53,696
You see, what had been witnessed

1307
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:54,739
was not
what actually happened.

1308
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:39,635
Monsieur Allerton
heard a pop...

1309
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:41,596
He heard a splash,

1310
01:32:41,721 --> 01:32:42,972
and he heard something else:

1311
01:32:43,014 --> 01:32:45,683
the footsteps of someone
running past his door.

1312
01:32:46,059 --> 01:32:49,979
Now, who could possibly be running
on the starboard side? No one.

1313
01:32:50,521 --> 01:32:52,523
Except Simon Doyle.

1314
01:32:53,316 --> 01:32:55,234
You cooked all that up yourself?

1315
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,528
But that's all nonsense!
Downright slander!

1316
01:32:57,612 --> 01:32:58,863
As I have said,

1317
01:32:58,863 --> 01:33:01,074
it looked as if this crime could have
been committed in the spur of the moment.

1318
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:02,742
<i>But, non, non, it was not.</i>

1319
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:06,371
It was not an accident that you had
in your pocket red ink,

1320
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:09,791
it was not an accidente that the revolver
was kicked under the chair.

1321
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,334
<i>- Jacqueline!
- Oui.</i>

1322
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:13,169
Who gives to Monsieur Doyle his alibi?

1323
01:33:13,294 --> 01:33:16,589
The shooting of him by Jacqueline.
Who gives to Jacqueline hers?

1324
01:33:16,923 --> 01:33:20,259
You, Mademoiselle Robson, staying
with her all of the night at his insistence.

1325
01:33:20,385 --> 01:33:24,097
Oh, the two halves of the murder,
with all the qualities required:

1326
01:33:24,472 --> 01:33:26,683
the cool, resourceful plan
of Jacqueline,

1327
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:30,228
and the man of action to carry it out.
They had been lovers...

1328
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:33,564
Realize that they are still lovers
and it all makes sense.

1329
01:33:35,066 --> 01:33:40,238
But then, your plan goes horribly wrong,
does it not, Monsieur Doyle?

1330
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,574
For Louise, the maid, sees you
and hints you that she requires

1331
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,077
the money for hushing her up.

1332
01:33:46,202 --> 01:33:47,286
You manage to inform Jacqueline

1333
01:33:47,453 --> 01:33:49,914
and tell to her where Doctor Hessner
keeps his scalpels.

1334
01:33:57,422 --> 01:34:00,842
<i>Et presto!...
She returns the scalpel,</i>

1335
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:03,928
hurries into lunch,
rather late and breathless.

1336
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:06,806
But still, all is not well,
Madame Otterbourne saw her,

1337
01:34:06,973 --> 01:34:09,976
rushes in to tell us.
You raised your voice to her...

1338
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,353
You saw the person who killed
my wife?

1339
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,523
Nerves, I thought.
But the door was open

1340
01:34:15,648 --> 01:34:17,275
and you were hinting of the danger

1341
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,570
to your partner in crime...
she acted like lightening.

1342
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:24,490
She remembered that Monsieur Pennington
had in his cabin a gun.

1343
01:34:26,075 --> 01:34:28,202
Cracked behind the curtain here, and...

1344
01:34:30,163 --> 01:34:32,206
Another problem solved.

1345
01:34:32,665 --> 01:34:34,584
I am correct, am I not, Monsieur Doyle?

1346
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:37,670
What happened to the first bullet
fired by the girl?

1347
01:34:37,795 --> 01:34:39,797
What is the matter, Monsieur Doyle,
has the cat got you by the tongue?

1348
01:34:39,922 --> 01:34:41,299
It went into the settee.

1349
01:34:41,424 --> 01:34:43,760
Removed it and threw it out
of the window.

1350
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,346
You also carried with you
a spare cartridge

1351
01:34:46,471 --> 01:34:48,598
to make it look as if two bullets
had been fired...

1352
01:34:48,765 --> 01:34:50,350
Did you not, Monsieur Doyle?

1353
01:34:51,434 --> 01:34:54,854
<i>A crime that was almost parfait,</i>

1354
01:34:55,897 --> 01:34:58,691
you kill your wife, you inherit her money
and, in due course,

1355
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,651
you marry your true love.

1356
01:35:00,818 --> 01:35:04,655
It seems as if you did tought of everything,
Monsieur Doyle, except for one thing.

1357
01:35:08,576 --> 01:35:10,036
Hercule Poirot.

1358
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:17,001
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

1359
01:35:17,502 --> 01:35:19,128
Oh, there, there, Monsieur Doyle.

1360
01:35:20,672 --> 01:35:22,090
The executioner here

1361
01:35:23,966 --> 01:35:25,885
is very eficient.

1362
01:35:27,512 --> 01:35:30,056
<i>Non, the mechanism
it works like clockwork...</i>

1363
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:32,809
... as a rule.

1364
01:35:35,269 --> 01:35:38,356
I love him to death.
I can't help it.

1365
01:35:41,317 --> 01:35:43,695
As I say,
love makes you do things...

1366
01:35:46,698 --> 01:35:51,077
We... worked everything out,
so carefully,

1367
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:59,252
but even then he went and wrote a ''J''
in the wall in her blood,

1368
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,922
such a stupid thing,

1369
01:36:03,256 --> 01:36:05,800
but absolutely typical.

1370
01:36:09,137 --> 01:36:10,930
So, we got away with it.

1371
01:36:12,306 --> 01:36:13,891
Until Louise Bourget,

1372
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,272
how do you say,
put a spinel in the works.

1373
01:36:22,358 --> 01:36:25,987
- Yes, I can't believe I did that.
- And then Madame Otterbourne.

1374
01:36:29,115 --> 01:36:33,202
It's so dreadfully easy killing people,
Monsieur Poirot.

1375
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:37,415
You begin to feel it doesn't matter.

1376
01:36:43,921 --> 01:36:47,467
That evening, in the grounds of the hotel,
when you said you saw someone...

1377
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:51,679
... ther was no person there, was there?

1378
01:36:55,099 --> 01:36:56,934
Just a little red herring,

1379
01:36:57,393 --> 01:36:59,020
to keep you on your toes.

1380
01:37:02,607 --> 01:37:05,777
Do you remember when I said
I must follow my star?

1381
01:37:09,405 --> 01:37:11,491
It's finally burned out, hasn't it?

1382
01:37:22,335 --> 01:37:24,962
Monsieur Pennington, you must be
happy to return home.

1383
01:37:25,088 --> 01:37:27,215
I'm not sure
if I got a home to go, still,

1384
01:37:27,674 --> 01:37:29,550
but thanks for asking.

1385
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:34,222
<i>- I'm sure he'll get by.
- Oui.</i>

1386
01:37:38,184 --> 01:37:39,477
Mademoiselle.

1387
01:37:42,772 --> 01:37:46,401
Monsieur Poirot! Wonderful news!
I've decided to get married!

1388
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:49,112
That is most wonderful,
indeed, Mademoiselle.

1389
01:37:49,237 --> 01:37:51,364
- Who is the lucky man?
- Dr. Bessner.

1390
01:37:51,864 --> 01:37:54,784
- Bessner?!
- He asked me last night.

1391
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:58,037
He's so kind. He says I can
help him in his work.

1392
01:37:58,246 --> 01:38:00,540
He's gonna teach me all about neurosis.

1393
01:38:00,707 --> 01:38:02,917
May I offer you my congratulations,
Mademoiselle?

1394
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:04,711
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you.

1395
01:38:04,877 --> 01:38:08,715
- Have you told your cousin this news?
- Oh, yes! She's absolutely thrilled.

1396
01:38:10,008 --> 01:38:12,468
Dr. Bessner, I offer you
my congratulations, also.

1397
01:38:12,593 --> 01:38:14,846
<i>Danke schon, danke schon,
we are very happy.</i>

1398
01:38:14,971 --> 01:38:16,431
Yes.

1399
01:38:18,558 --> 01:38:23,438
- I'm sorry.
- Yes. I'm not very experienced

1400
01:38:23,646 --> 01:38:26,691
in these matters, you see?
I thought I'd struck gold.

1401
01:38:26,858 --> 01:38:30,111
It happens, Monsieur Ferguson,

1402
01:38:31,529 --> 01:38:33,906
more often
than one might suppose.

1403
01:38:35,116 --> 01:38:37,035
<i>- Goodbye.
- Au revoir.</i>

1404
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:38,494
Coronel.

1405
01:39:03,978 --> 01:39:05,980
Who would have thought
it would come to this?

1406
01:39:06,522 --> 01:39:09,400
It was you, Mademoiselle who said
that life was unfair.

1407
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:11,110
Hello, Simon.

1408
01:39:12,362 --> 01:39:16,574
I messed up again, didn't I?
Confessed a lot. I'm sorry...

1409
01:39:17,492 --> 01:39:21,746
It's a fool's game, my darling,
and we've lost, that's all.

1410
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:29,128
Please, may I kiss him? I'm not sure
I'll get another chance.

1411
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,098
Goodbye, my darling.

1412
01:39:43,601 --> 01:39:45,603
You know how much I love you...

1413
01:39:49,941 --> 01:39:51,234
Goodbye.

1414
01:39:54,529 --> 01:39:58,574
- Where the devil did she get that?
- She had two of them.

1415
01:39:58,783 --> 01:40:02,245
She set it in your handbag, Mademoiselle,
in the day of the search

1416
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,832
and retrieved later,
when she visited your cabin.

1417
01:40:08,376 --> 01:40:10,003
You knew?

1418
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:15,591
It is not always that simple.

1419
01:40:17,218 --> 01:40:21,973
... love is the sweetest thing ...

1420
01:40:23,474 --> 01:40:27,645
... what else on eath
could ever bring ...
