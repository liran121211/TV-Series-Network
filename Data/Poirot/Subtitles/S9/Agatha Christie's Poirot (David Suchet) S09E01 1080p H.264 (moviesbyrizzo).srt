FIVE LITTLE PIGS

Mademoiselle Lemarchant...
- For starters, Monsieur Poirot,

14
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,604
that is not my name.

15
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,858
<i>Pardon,</i> but I understood it was
with Mademoiselle Lemarchant

16
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,486
that I was to meet.
- That was the name I was given as a child.

17
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,656
My real name is Crale,
Lucy Crale.

18
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,327
- Crale! Now, I seem to remember...
- My father was Amyas Crale,

19
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,997
the artist, and my mother was...

20
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,750
- Caroline.
- Caroline... Crale.

21
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,338
- That's right.
- Yes, yes...

22
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,800
A story most tragic.

23
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,431
- But it was a long time ago, yes?
- Fourteen years.

24
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,183
14 years?

25
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,649
You know, I saw a picture
that your father painted...

26
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,151
... in the Tate.

27
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,946
- "Girl In The Shadow" .
- That was the one.

28
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,574
- It is a composition most tracking.
- Yes, he was a great painter.

29
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,955
- His reputation is, yes, considerable.
- I'm not here to discuss his art, Mr Poirot.

30
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,083
I'm here because I want you
to investigate his murder.

31
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:56,129
I was 7 at the time. Too young,
really, to know anything about it.

32
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,342
We lived in Devon,
in a house called Alderbury.

33
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,721
My parents were very much
in love and, in many ways,

34
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,307
it was an idyllic childhood.

35
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:13,480
But then, one day,
I was suddenly taken from my home

36
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,066
and sent to relatives, in Canada.

37
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:21,029
Then finally, when I turned 21,
they were obliged to tell me the truth.

38
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,825
For one thing,
I came into my own money.

39
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,580
And then, you see, there's the letter...

40
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,457
- The letter?
- That my mother wrote me

41
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,626
just before she died.

42
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:40,215
That was the first I knew that my mother
was hanged for killing my father.

43
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,563
That is what I want you to prove.

44
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,903
- But why Hercule Poirot, Mademoiselle?
- I've heard about you, the things you've done,

45
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,909
the way you work. The psicology
is your "forte", <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

46
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,955
<i>Oui, c'est vrai.</i> My success
it is found in psicology, or...

47
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,169
... the " why" of human behavior.
It is this that I use.

48
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,885
<i>Tout de même, Mademoiselle,</i>
it is so long since it happened.

49
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,387
Secrets and lies, Monsieur.

50
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,310
The past keeps pulling me back,
it won't let me be.

51
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,397
And until these ghosts
are laid to rest,

52
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,983
I can't move on.

53
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,197
<i>Bon,</i>

54
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,910
I am honored
by your faith in me.

55
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,626
But...

56
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,256
I can not, you understand, accept the
insurance about the innocence of your mother?

57
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,718
- And if she was guillty, what then?
- I have to know the truth, Monsieur.

58
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,138
And if the truth is not
what you wish to hear?

59
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,850
I have to know.

60
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,137
... taken for a place of execution,

61
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,350
where you'll be hanged by the neck,
until death.

62
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,438
Not one of my greatest successes,
I have to say.

63
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,861
- The defence was suicide, yes?
- Didn't get on too well, I'm affraid.

64
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,530
Amyas Crale simply wasn't
that kind of chap.

65
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,576
Wine, women, beer...
the lusts of the flesh.

66
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,662
The idea of his
killing himself out of conscience...

67
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,372
Well, frankly,
I don't think he had one.

68
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:21,627
So, in your opinion, Sir Montague,
Caroline Crale, she was guilty?

69
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,048
I rather thought
that we were taking that for granted.

70
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,927
- Did she ever admit as much?
- Monsieur Poirot, she didn't need to.

71
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,056
I knew we had lost
as soon as she stepped into this box.

72
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>She certainly had a motive.</i>

73
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,977
<i>Amyas Crale was always
mixed up with some woman around him,</i>

74
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,687
<i>but this was rather different.</i>

75
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>A girl.: Elsa Greer.
Just turned 18.</i>

76
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,945
<i>Quite a looker, I might say.
She knew what she wanted,</i>

77
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,907
<i>and that was Amyas Crale.
She got him to paint her</i>

78
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,243
he ended up falling for her.

79
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,581
Caroline Crale was overheard
to say this...

80
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,876
... if he didn't give her up,
she'd kill him.

81
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,045
What was the evidence against her?

82
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,550
She stole some poison to the neighbor
who dabbled in herbs and alike,

83
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,678
and hid it in a scent bottle,
and when the police found it

84
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,347
in her room, she claimed
she intended to kill herself.

85
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,599
What she couldn't explain
was why the bottle was empty

86
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,810
and only her fingerprints
were on it.

87
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,313
We contempted, of course, that
Amyas Crale had used it to kill himself,

88
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,359
but, if he had, his fingerprints
would be on it as well.

89
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,906
And how did she give it to him,
this poison?

90
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,659
She used a pipet to spike
his beer.

91
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,452
<i>Pardon, Monsieur.</i> "Spike"?

92
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,748
Uh- tempered. She took him a bottle
while he was painting.

93
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,711
The police found the pipet
crashed near the scene of the crime.

94
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,130
The prosecution had a filled day.

95
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,263
So,

96
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,726
she put the conium into the bottle
before taking it to him?

97
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,937
No, there was no conium in the bottle
at all, only in the glass.

98
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,564
I see!

99
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,235
- Was that you beeing inscrutable, Mr Poirot?
<i>- Non, non. Pardon.</i>

100
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,114
But were there, I'd believe,
other people present, at the time?

101
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,076
Oh, yes, there were. Let me think.
Five, if memory serves.

102
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,123
<i>Philip Blake, a stock broker,
one of Crale's best friends;</i>

103
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,251
<i>Meredith, his older brother.</i>

104
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,339
<i>He lives across the estuary, from the
house where the murder took place ;</i>

105
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:34,635
<i>Elsa Greer, of course,
currently Lady Dittisham,</i>

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,762
<i>though now
she spends most of her time</i>

107
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,515
<i>in the gossip columns
in the divorce Courts;</i>

108
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,478
<i>and the governess, Miss... Wilson?
Williams! That's it!</i>

109
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:49,149
<i>Very capable, but not exactly
a bottle of laughs.</i>

110
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,071
Then, of course, there was
Angela, Caroline's half-sister.

111
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh, she'd been off back to school,
by the time of the trial. Poor thing.

112
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,287
- She had perhaps a problem?
- There was a rather unfortunate incident,

113
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,081
when she was a toddler.

114
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,877
Caroline Crale, as a young girl,
threw a bit of a tantrum.

115
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,715
I did argue that she was not in
her sain mind, but...

116
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,804
Fascinanting creature!
I'll never forget her, you know?

117
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,015
She had a quality
one couldn't help but admire.

118
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,061
Somehow, she was,
above it all.

119
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,357
What people would do,
in the name of love!

120
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,193
It makes fools of us all,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

121
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,739
<i>Eh bien,</i> I thank you, Sir Montague.
You have been most helpful.

122
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,908
Pleasure meeting you, Poirot.

123
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,288
Tell to me, if you please...
If, as her daughter hopes,

124
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:49,126
Caroline Crale did not kill her husband...
- But she did, old boy. Take my word for it.

125
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,754
... but then it makes the logic that
one of these 5 people must have done it.

126
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,674
There's no reason
why any of them should.

127
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,552
No, but all the same, I think I shall
pay each of them a visit.

128
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,306
And hear five different versions
of the same event?

129
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,564
- Thank you, Hollinghurst.
- A pleasure, mr. Blake.

130
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,570
A fairly good aid, old Hollinghurst,
even though he does bat for the other side.

131
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,655
Telly-o!

132
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,658
Telly-o...

133
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,248
Well, who'd have thought it? Raising a glass
with the famous Hercule Porrow.

134
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,918
Poirot, Monsieur. Hercule Poirot.

135
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,880
Poirot, Porrow... Could never
get my tongue around French.

136
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,466
Let's keep
the old  <i>entente cordiale, eh?</i>

137
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,052
<i>But I am Belgium, Monsieur,
not French.</i>

138
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,264
So, what can I do for you?

139
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,770
<i>It is the Crale case, Monsieur.
It is that which I wish to discuss with you.</i>

140
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,232
What the hell for?

141
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,443
<i>Because I have accepted the commission
Monsieur to review the case.</i>

142
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,112
- From whom?
- Lucy Crale.

143
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,743
- Lucy Crale?
<i>- Oui, Monsieur.</i>

144
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,955
Nothing to discuss.

145
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,374
Five minutes of your time, Mr Blake,
it is all that I ask.

146
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,167
What the hell is she
poking her nose in, now?

147
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,753
- Because she wishes to know  the truth.
- Everyone knows the truth!

148
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,923
But all she wishes is to access
for herself the facts.

149
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:22,803
- It's over! Dead, buried.
- As are her parents, Monsieur.

150
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:33,605
Amyas Crale was the best friend
a chap could have.

151
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,694
We knew each other since we're children.
We all: myself, my brother, Caroline.

152
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,779
<i>Neighbors, you see.
By the seaside, in Devon.</i>

153
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:46,660
Amyas was a great play.
And all that talent, that...

154
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,913
... lust for life,
wiped out because of her.

155
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,207
You did not like her?

156
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:57,462
Rotten... through and through.
Amyas could never see it.

157
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,632
But he was also something of a
rotten, was he not?

158
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,426
That's what she'd have you believe.

159
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,597
Oh, she liked playing the injured part,
and did it very well,

160
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,850
but.... underneath it all,
she was cold and calculating.

161
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,935
Had a devil of a temper!

162
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,354
Tried to kill her baby sister,
for God's sake!

163
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,857
- Is it true?
- Damn right.

164
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,320
Chucked a paperweight at her
and blinded the little blight in one eye.

165
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,989
Disfigured for life.

166
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,367
Do you know the reason
for this fit of temper?

167
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,162
Sibling's jealousy,
simple as that.

168
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,707
And were jealously that
made her kill Amyas.

169
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,586
<i>I tell you, that woman
was trouble.</i>

170
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:42,216
<i>Even as a girl... the way
she played us boys along.</i>

171
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,260
<i>Gave us all the one say,
but finally settled on Amyas.</i>

172
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,929
<i>Not surprisingly.</i>

173
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:51,308
<i>He was in line to inherit Alderbury
and showing talent as an artist.</i>

174
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,062
<i>A rich genius,
what could be better?</i>

175
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,570
It is surprising, is it not, how soon
in life the dice is cast?

176
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,282
Yes, I suppose it is.

177
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,454
Anyway, after the marriage,
I kept my distance,

178
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,459
for a while, at least.
But I soon succumbed to temptation.

179
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,546
<i>Temptation, Monsieur?</i>

180
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,756
Alderbury.

181
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,926
<i>A place I couldn't resist.</i>

182
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:31,014
<i>I spent some of the happiest
times of my life in that house.</i>

183
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,486
<i>That September,
like the Summers of childhood,</i>

184
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,531
<i>I was hoping for a peaceful
few weeks.</i>

185
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,450
<i>- Uncle Phil!
- But I should've known better.</i>

186
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,874
- Good morning, mr. Blake.
- Good morning, mrs. Spriggs.

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,501
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

188
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,172
<i>- Amyas, please!</i>
- They've been at it for hours.

189
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,467
- Hello, uncle Phil.
- Hello!

190
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,430
My, you grown!
Angela's looking after you, is she?

191
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,932
- No? No?
- Com'on, Lucy!

192
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,643
- Catch me if you can!
- Give her a chance.

193
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,270
Wait for me, Angela.

194
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,401
- Why won't you listen to me, Amyas?
- Caroline, for God's sake!

195
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:29,406
- That's right, run away like ya always do.
- There goes the jardinere.

196
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,994
<i>There was something
up in the atmosphere...</i>

197
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,873
<i>But this time,
you could cut it with a knife.</i>

198
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,125
<i>And I soon saw why.</i>

199
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,756
Amyas, old chap! How the hell are ya?

200
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,675
Lovely, isn't she?

201
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,805
<i>Sometimes I wish
I'd never met her.</i>

202
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,434
Thank God you turned up.

203
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,854
Living in a house full of women is enough
to send any men out to his chump.

204
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,066
- Philip, how lovely to see you!
- Hello, Caroline.

205
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,694
Just in time for lunch.
Will Elsie be joining us?

206
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,281
- Elsa.
- Amyas is doing her portrait.

207
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,494
Skittish little thing. She should watch
all that sun, you know?

208
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,621
Can be very ageing.

209
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,754
- Things are a bit rocky at the moment.
- Is it serious, Elsa and you?

210
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,132
- It'll be a damn good painting.
- That's not what I asked.

211
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:34,179
You know me, Phil.
I can't help myself.

212
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,062
Then things got worse.

213
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>Amyas and Caroline's
half sister, Angela,</i>

214
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,860
<i>had been beckoning all morning.</i>

215
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,279
Would you stop that please, Angela?

216
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,739
- What?
- Slurping.

217
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,701
- I'm not slurping.
- Yes, you are.

218
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,996
Amyas...

219
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,379
<i>I thought I might try that other
kimono, the canary yellow.</i>

220
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,340
It could be rather stunning
against that water, don't you think?

221
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,759
Canary! How lovely.

222
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,513
Of course on some people it might
look a little... how shall I put it?

223
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,142
Don't worry, Caroline. I'm
young enough to carry it on.

224
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,145
We're not changing anything.
For God--! Did you hear that?

225
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,814
Looks like the feeding hour
in the monkey house!

226
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,983
Why don't you just
leave me alone?!

227
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,243
- I hadn't seen this before.
- It's by Wolgemut Dahl,

228
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:43,081
a young Norwegian. Extraordinary, don't
you think? Everyone's talking about him.

229
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,168
Got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

230
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,046
Don't you agree, Miss Williams?

231
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,717
- Beech wood, isn't it?
- Thank you, mrs. Spriggs.

232
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:20,744
This room would be so lovely
if it weren't so clutched.

233
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,623
When I'm living here,
I'll throw out all the rubbish,

234
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,918
which is, let's face it,
is pratically everything.

235
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,422
And I've always thought copper coloured
curtains would be simply divine.

236
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,094
Don't you think they look
rather lovely in the setting sun?

237
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:45,060
- Are you thinking of buying any, Elsa?
- That won't be necessary.

238
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,856
- You seem to have lost me, my dear.
- All this pretense,

239
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,983
it's so dishonest.

240
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,571
Amyas and I love each other
and we're going to be married,

241
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,533
so I shall be moving in.
- As I suspected, my dear,

242
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,910
you're completely insane.

243
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,166
That bloody bisque
gave me a frightful indigestion.

244
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,459
Ask mrs. Spriggs, she'll give you
bicarbonate of soda.

245
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,044
Good thinking.

246
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,466
By the way, Elsa says
you want to marry her.

247
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,386
Is this true?

248
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:26,310
- Is it true?
- It's only fair that she should know.

249
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,941
Amyas, is it true?

250
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,198
Then, it is.

251
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,206
If you'll excuse me, I'll just...

252
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,874
You know, looking back,

253
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,463
I wouldn't be surprised if she had
made up her mind to kill him then.

254
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,472
Amyas, do tide yourself up. We're going
up to Meredith for tea, remember?

255
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,642
- Ahn, yes, I'd forgotten.
- Philip,

256
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:11,230
you should do some fishing while you're here.
The sea's probably sworming with mackerel.

257
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,529
So, we all trooped off to Merri's.

258
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,615
Weren't very merry that afternoon...

259
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,254
Amyas can't do this!

260
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,632
Looks like he's going to.

261
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:43,053
He can't just leave his wife and child
for some slip of a girl.

262
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,014
She's too young to know
what she's doing.

263
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,975
She knows all right.

264
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:58,151
Poor old Merri, all that sensitivity
no use at all.

265
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,030
Hard to believe we come
from the same stable.

266
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,829
After tea, he took us to his lab.

267
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,249
Conium. I've never heard of this.

268
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,794
It's distilled from the flowers
of the spotted hemlock.

269
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,506
Highly poisonous, but can be
efficacious in the treatment...

270
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,632
Sorry.

271
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,467
<i>Then he had the treat
to read us</i>

272
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,596
<i>some classical about the whole death
of Plato or Socrates,</i>

273
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,972
<i>or someting whatnot.</i>

274
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,309
"The man who administered the poison
pinched his foot,

275
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:34,479
"and asked if he felt.
Socrates said no.

276
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,024
"Then he did the same to his legs,

277
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:40,819
"and gradually, moving up
and led us this way, and let us see

278
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,572
"that he was cold and numb.

279
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:49,286
"He said that, when it reached
the heart,

280
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,872
Sócrates would be gone."

281
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,959
Back at HQ, that evening,

282
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:59,838
Amyas and Angela had a God-allMighty
row about someting,

283
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,508
but nothing out of the ordinary.

284
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,553
I even think she might have
thrown something at thim.

285
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,639
- Can you remember what?
- Good Lord, no.

286
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:12,518
- It was 14 years ago!
- But yes, of course.

287
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,562
You are being most helpful,
Monsieur Blake.

288
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,981
The next morning,
when I came downstairs,

289
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,860
I heard Amyas
and Caroline in the library.

290
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,154
<i>I don't know where they
the energy from.</i>

291
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,447
<i>...I swear to God!</i>

292
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:28,826
<i>You and your women!
Someday I'll kill you, Amyas.</i>

293
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,161
<i>- Don't be idiot.
- I swear to God I will!</i>

294
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,249
Good morning.

295
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:40,504
- Lovely day!
- I want to get on.

296
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:45,717
- I'll go change.
- Don't be long. Bloody women!

297
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:51,515
<i>And off he went, back to his painting
while I went back inside.</i>

298
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,311
- Good morning.
- It's too cruel, too cruel.

299
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,355
<i>She hardly noticed me.</i>

300
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,191
<i>Now, of course, I know why.</i>

301
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,326
Hello?

302
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,662
What the hell's the matter?

303
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,260
I heard these noises
from the laboratory...

304
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,890
... so, I went to have a look
and the conium bottle

305
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:36,226
was not only out of place,
but was practically empty.

306
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,896
And I swear to you, Phil,
that yesterday it was full.

307
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,481
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure!

308
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,318
I'm very careful about these things.

309
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,529
And I knew at once it must
have been Caroline.

310
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,533
I should've gone straight to Amyas
and warned him.

311
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,745
That's absurd. Caroline
wouldn't dream of such a thing.

312
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,414
<i>- Then, what's your explanation ?
- ..being too harsh with her.</i>

313
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,209
<i>- For God's sake!
- We'll discuss after lunch.</i>

314
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,044
I'll see to her packing...

315
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,838
- What are you two up to ?
- We were just...

316
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,340
- What a surprise!
- Yes...

317
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,885
We're just having a little chat
about Angela and school.

318
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,930
I'm not sure at all
it is the right thing.

319
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,807
Sorry about that.

320
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,770
- Hello everybody!
- I'd kill for a cold beer.

321
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,688
I'll send some down.

322
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,153
I think we all could do with one.

323
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,406
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

324
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,618
- Why don't I take it?
- Oh, no! Enjoy the sun.

325
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,372
<i>At the time, I reasoned
that it might be jealousy,</i>

326
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:42,584
That she couldn't stand the thought
of the two of them being alone together.

327
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:47,965
I should've realized, but, instead
I sat and watched.

328
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:54,721
I had the chance to save him,
and I did nothing.

329
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,058
You reproach yourself unduly,
Monsieur Blake.

330
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,104
Amyas didn't join us for lunch,

331
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,774
and Caroline took him cofee.

332
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,236
so calm and collected,
and yet,

333
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,822
she must have known by then
he'd be dead.

334
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:18,078
Miss Williams went with her,
and then Meredith...

335
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:22,958
... wandered off, but it wasn't long
before we saw him again.

336
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,836
Get a doctor! Quick!

337
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,671
What's wrong?

338
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,340
- It's Amyas...
- What?

339
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,634
I'm affraid he's dead.

340
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,056
Amyas!

341
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:42,019
Phone a doctor.
I'll take care of her.

342
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:47,858
She was like an Avenging Fury.
I had mever seen anything  like it.

343
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:52,321
You killed him! You killed you !
My Amyas!

344
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:14,051
- You've killed my dearest friend!
- No!

345
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,682
- He did it to himself.
- Tell that to the police.

346
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:32,277
They didn't believe her either.

347
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,823
<i>Eh bien, Monsieur Blake,</i>

348
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:40,994
The truth, it has the habit of revealing itself.

349
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,962
Monsieur Poirot...

350
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:54,550
- Lady Dittisham...
- Let's get on with it, shall we?

351
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,264
I said all I had to say about
the Crale Case many years ago.

352
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,434
But I found your letter
rather intriguing.

353
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,648
How lucky you are curiosity
took the better of me.

354
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,571
Indeed I am, milady.

355
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:21,952
It must be very painful
for you to recall.

356
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,621
Painful? No.

357
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:28,834
My father was a manhandled who
worked his way up and made a Mint.

358
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:33,338
You can't do that with thin skin
in eye, I'm my father's daughter.

359
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,091
I am not as sensitive
as you might think.

360
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,385
Then that makes my task a little easier.

361
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,722
One so often jumps to
the wrong conclusion.

362
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,098
At the trial, for example,

363
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,560
people thought what a terrible
ordeal it must have been for me:

364
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,189
the brutish questions,
the ghastly jornalists,

365
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:52,316
the mindless screaming crowd.

366
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,319
But the english are a people
very moral, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

367
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,571
That's one way of looking at it.

368
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,240
<i>Alors,</i> if you did not find
the trial an ordeal,

369
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,577
how do you find it?
- I enjoyed it.

370
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,663
You see, I got exactly
what I wanted.

371
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,000
And what was that?

372
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,464
Caroline Crale
at the end of a rope.

373
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,299
Coffee?

374
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,347
Thank you, Tipping.

375
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,184
You said in your letter
that Mademoiselle...

376
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,603
- Lemarchant.
- That's right.

377
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,814
Had commissioned you.
I don't believe I know her.

378
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,193
She is the daughter of
Amyas and Caroline Crale.

379
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,780
Oh, yes! Of course.
There was a child.

380
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:43,742
Oh, dear!
Does she think it was my fault?

381
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,203
It is a possible interpretation, <i>oui.</i>

382
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:49,790
- How very stupid. Cream?
<i>- Non, non. Merci.</i>

383
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,004
So, you take no responsability?

384
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:01,176
Why should I? I loved him,
and I would've made him happy.

385
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,888
And that woman killed him
to stop that from happening.

386
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:10,978
You have to understand, Amyas Crale
did not seduce an innocent young girl.

387
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,939
<i>It wasn't like that at all.</i>

388
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,277
Elsa Greer.

389
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,864
As soon as I laid eyes on him,
I knew I had to have him.

390
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:26,201
- I want you to paint me.
- I don't do portraits.

391
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,539
I'm rather rich, you know?
I can afford to pay.

392
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:34,918
And what makes you think
I'd want to paint you?

393
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,050
But you do, don't you?
And I always get what I want.

394
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,554
So, when do we start?

395
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:50,601
If I paint you, you realise
I'll make love to you?

396
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,854
I'd have thought
that went without saying.

397
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:59,109
So, he invited me down to their house,
quite bold of him, really.

398
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,778
<i>But Caroline
didn't seem to mind.</i>

399
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,908
<i>She didn't like me, but then,
why should she?</i>

400
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,161
<i>And  we never said anything
that she couldn't have overheard.</i>

401
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,058
<i>But we were more than aware
of what was going on.</i>

402
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,101
What is it?

403
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,314
I think you ought to go
back to London.

404
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:42,319
But the picture... we've hardly started.

405
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,243
I can't paint you, Elsa.

406
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,871
- Why?
- You know why.

407
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,583
<i>So, I left.
I didn't write, or telephone.</i>

408
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,752
<i>And after 10 days...</i>

409
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:08,178
<i>He couldn't keep away.
We were together for two weeks</i>

410
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,265
<i>and soon we realised that
we had to be together.</i>

411
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,184
<i>- Always.
- I want you to come back to Alderbury.</i>

412
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,813
I've decided to finish the painting.

413
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:22,818
- What about Caroline?
- What about her?

414
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:27,698
- Shouldn't you tell her?
- What on earth for?

415
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:32,035
She's bound to find out,
sooner or later.

416
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,997
We'll get the picture finished first.

417
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,208
But you will tell her, won't you?

418
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,128
- Yes.
- Promise?

419
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,714
Promise.

420
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,262
Do you she'll make
a terrible fuss?

421
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,598
She always makes a fuss.

422
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,226
She loves me.

423
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:00,814
Then she should put
your happiness first.

424
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:08,280
<i>He painted in a kind of frenzy.
I'd never seen like that before.</i>

425
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:29,051
<i>- Keep still, for God's sake!
- I was convinced we should tell her,</i>

426
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:34,765
<i>but Amyas wouldn't hear of it. Then,
one day, I... lost my patience.</i>

427
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:39,269
Amyas and I love each other
and we are going to be married.

428
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,355
So I shall be moving in.

429
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,857
Amyas was furious

430
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,362
but he had to admit
what I said was true.

431
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,909
And I still think I was right. Honesty is,
after all the best policy, don't you agree Mr Poirot?

432
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,579
Desirable, certainly,
but not always advisable.

433
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,040
We believe in plain speaking,
where I come from.

434
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,292
I'm very pleased to hear it, Madame.

435
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,629
But Caroline had a devious way
about her.

436
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:09,466
When we went to Meredith
for tea, that afternoon,

437
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,302
she behaved as if
nothing had happened.

438
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:15,889
I even began to think
she was taking it rather well.

439
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,891
How wrong I was!

440
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,938
If you please to tell me,
Lady Dittisham,

441
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,148
in plain speaking,

442
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,820
if, when you were all assembled
in the laboratory of Monsieur Blake,

443
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:35,075
you observed Caroline Crale take the conium.
- No, I did not.

444
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,705
<i>I seem to remember chatting
with Meredith in the doorway,</i>

445
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,291
<i>so I wouldn't have been able to see a thing.
- Caroline...</i>

446
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:46,211
Sorry, Merri.
It's such a fascinanting collection...

447
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,840
But of course she did take it,
and we all know why.

448
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:53,010
Perhaps not everyone is
as sure as you.

449
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,220
I actually heard her threatening him.

450
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,723
You and your women!
Someday I'll kill you, Amyas.

451
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,600
- Don't be an idiot.
- I swear to God I'll kill you.

452
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,310
You can threaten all you like,
but get this,

453
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:03,562
I'm going to marry Elsa
and nothing is going to stop me.

454
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,814
- I'll kill you rather than let you go.
- Morning.

455
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,358
For God's sake!

456
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,743
- Lovely day!
- I want to get on.

457
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,913
- I'll go change.
- Don't be long.

458
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:26,251
<i>Which I did. Then, I went to
join him and I poured him a beer.</i>

459
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,635
She's making a terrible
song and dance.

460
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,762
Told you she would.

461
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,560
- To my Mona Lisa.
- My darling Amyas.

462
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,441
- God, it's warm!
- I can get you a cold one.

463
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,986
On that seat. Sit down, now!

464
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,240
He painted as if his life
depended on it.

465
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,285
Dear Amyas...

466
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:03,372
I loved him so much...

467
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:11,338
It happened shortly after that. I
popped up to the house to fetch a shawl,

468
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,508
and, when I came back, she was there.

469
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,554
Sorry about that.

470
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,432
Hello everybody!

471
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,229
- I'd kill for a cold beer.
- I'll send some down.

472
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:40,701
<i>She must have known then
what she meant to do.</i>

473
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,996
<i>She brought it back
about 10 minutos later.</i>

474
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,710
Tastes foul!

475
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,504
Everything tastes foul, today.

476
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,926
Too much bile, my dear.
It'll choke you, one of these days.

477
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:03,932
<i>I didn't suspect a thing.
About 40 minutes later,</i>

478
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:08,854
<i>he complained about stiffness and pains.
- Bloody rheumatism!</i>

479
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:13,358
<i>Then, the bell sounded for lunch
and Meredith came to fetch me.</i>

480
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,446
<i>Amyas decided to skip lunch,
as he often did.</i>

481
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,406
Old grumpy doesn't want any lunch.

482
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,493
So we left him...

483
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,786
... to die alone.

484
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,751
Amyas! Amyas!

485
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,836
And I just knew it was Caroline.

486
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,341
How could she do that?
How could she?

487
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:41,929
It is a story most...

488
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,641
<i>... tragique, n'est-ce pas?</i>

489
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,144
Hanging was too good for her.

490
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,293
Monsieur Blake...

491
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,596
Little Lucy...

492
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:29,476
... a grown woman.
One can hardly believe it.

493
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:33,438
- Time passes swiftly, does it not?
- Poor child.

494
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:38,318
Such a terrible shock. How much
better to let it all be.

495
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,367
The whole point, you see, is that
Amyas Crale was an artist,

496
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,911
and his art was his passion.

497
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:51,874
When he painted,
he was like a man-- possessed.

498
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:56,003
He meant to finish that portrait,
whatever the cost.

499
00:38:56,461 --> 00:39:01,508
Elsa was terrifically enthusiastic
about the painting, and Caroline...

500
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,598
- Yes?
- I had always been...

501
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,185
... very fond of her.

502
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,770
Come on, Merri, come on!

503
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,150
<i>There was a time
when I'd hoped to marry her,</i>

504
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:21,028
<i>but that was soon nipped in the bud.</i>

505
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,531
Still I remained,
if I may say so,

506
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,783
devoted to her service.

507
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,537
Dear God!

508
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:36,835
When I think of what they did to her!
Strung up like an animal!

509
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:42,466
Such a gentle creature...

510
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,729
<i>I remember a conversation we had
shortly after it all began.</i>

511
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,819
Do you think he really cares for her?

512
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,992
Well, he's very committed to
the painting.

513
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:15,958
- He's in love with her, isn't he?
- A little, perhaps.

514
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:21,255
A great deal, I think.

515
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:28,178
There's only one person
he reallly cares for, I think that's you.

516
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,850
These infatuations, they come
and they go.

517
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,435
That's what I used to think.

518
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:39,731
But this time I've a feeling it's serious.

519
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:45,904
- She's just a girl.
- That's the trouble.

520
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,866
The way she looks at him!

521
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,910
So intense!

522
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,749
I'm affraid, Meredith.

523
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,921
It's nothing.

524
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:08,427
I hope you're right.
But I can't help feeling

525
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:11,096
I'd like to take a hatchet to her.

526
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,849
- A hatchet?
- It's a small ax.

527
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:17,269
I know what a hatchet is. I was
commenting rather on her remark.

528
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,814
- It was merely to make her point.
- She made her point a little more forcibly,

529
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,859
forcibly, did she not? With her
baby sister Angela,

530
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,028
- The paperweight.
<i>- Oui.</i>

531
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:29,907
It was a moment of sibling's jealousy
for which she never forgave herself.

532
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:31,950
And disfigured a girl for life.

533
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,453
That was the problem.
It was a constant reminder,

534
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,414
and she tried desperatly
to make amends,

535
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,833
which, in turn,
made Amyas very jealous.

536
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,461
You knew him for many years,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

537
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,546
Since boyhood.

538
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:51,678
But he was always more
Philip's friend than mine.

539
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,430
<i>You did not like him?</i>

540
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:57,851
<i>I think his conduct was
frankly disgraceful.</i>

541
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,354
Don't you understand?

542
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:05,275
This painting is the best thing I've done
and I'm determined to see it through.

543
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:09,112
No. I think it's a disgrace...

544
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:14,076
... the way you treat Caroline.
The way you've always treated her.

545
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:18,247
What about Lucy, for Heaven's sake?
You can't just throw it all away.

546
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:22,292
You're a good man, Merri,
but such a old softy.

547
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:26,213
Wait til the picture is finished
then you'll see I was right.

548
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,425
<i>That grin he gave me...</i>

549
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,268
<i>I'll never forget Caroline,
that afternoon.</i>

550
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,271
<i>She made such an effort,
and yet, behind it all...</i>

551
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:45,107
Is there anything the matter, my dear?

552
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:50,028
Everything. It's gone.

553
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,615
Finished.

554
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:59,329
When she said, at the trial,
that she took the poison to kill herself,

555
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,832
I swear she was speaking the truth.

556
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,090
But why did you take your guests
into the laboratory?

557
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,594
- Someone must have sugested it.
- Caroline Crale, perhaps?

558
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,347
Well, I often took guests into
my laboratory. It wasn't unusual.

559
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,933
- This is valerian.
- The one that cats like.

560
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:24,605
Yes, they can't get enough of it.
It can be used as a sleeping draft.

561
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,986
Elsa, You should have a sniff.

562
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,531
I've amount pleasure
from my brews,

563
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:39,119
getting the plants at night,
macerating and all the rest of it..

564
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:42,539
It's astonishing how a simple
decoction can make wonders.

565
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:47,044
Conium. I've never heard of this.

566
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:50,547
It's distilled from the flowers
of the spotted hemlock.

567
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,800
- Isn't that what Socrates took?
- That's right.

568
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:59,640
You know, there's the most moving
description of his death on Plato's "Fédon".

569
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,228
I can read it to you if you'd like.

570
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,566
Sorry. Sorry,
it must be the heat.

571
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:14,404
"The man who administered the poison
pinched his foot,

572
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:17,991
"and asked if he felt anything.
Socrates said no.

573
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,743
"Then, he did the same to his legs,

574
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,704
"gradually moving upwards,
showing us this way and letting us

575
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:26,333
"see that he was getting cold and numb.

576
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:30,003
<i>"He said that when it reached
the heart,</i>

577
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,923
<i>Socrates would be gone."</i>

578
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:38,595
And that is how Amyas
met his fate...

579
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,223
... the very next day.

580
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:45,726
When did Madame Crale
take the conium from the bottle?

581
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:49,522
Just before she came
into the study area...

582
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:53,401
I think Philip e a Angela
left first,

583
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:58,155
<i>followed by Amyas. I was
in the doorway, waiting to lock up,</i>

584
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:01,951
<i>having a word with Elsa. I supose
that's when she took it.</i>

585
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,078
- Caroline.
- Oh sorry, Merri.

586
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,497
Such a fascinating collection...

587
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:48,831
Phil? It's Meredith.
Something terrible's happened.

588
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:54,378
He immediately suspected Caroline.

589
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,547
Quite unfairly, in my opinion.

590
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,799
Who else could have done it?
It must have been Caroline.

591
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:01,844
<i>As we approached the water garden,
we overheard Amyas and Caroline</i>

592
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,763
<i>having a rather heated discussion,</i>

593
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:07,058
<i>I think about Angela
being packed off to school.</i>

594
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,684
It's such a shameful behaviour!

595
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:11,562
<i>I was in such a state
I didn't pay it much atention.</i>

596
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:15,191
It's settled.
I'll see to her packing.

597
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:20,029
Philip blamed himself
for not acting sooner,

598
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,823
but how on earth could
anyone have assumed,

599
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,826
at that point, that someone
had murder in mind?

600
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:28,412
<i>I needed time to think.</i>

601
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,375
<i>So, just before lunch, I sat
above the water garden</i>

602
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:35,002
<i>where Amyas was painting Elsa.</i>

603
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:41,217
... and I can sit like like a
Roman Emperess in the Coliseum.

604
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,844
<i>So radiant,</i>

605
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,305
<i>full of life,</i>

606
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,559
<i>more alive than any person
I have ever known.</i>

607
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:54,021
<i>- Keep still!
- The blind confidence of youth.</i>

608
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:57,233
- Bloody rheumatism!
- Poor thing!

609
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,413
Old grumpy doesn't want any lunch.

610
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:14,500
<i>The problem was, he often looked
like that when he was working,</i>

611
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,003
<i>so I didn't think anything of it.</i>

612
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:21,132
- Elsa...
- I could eat a horse.

613
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,677
You know, I do so wish...

614
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:27,430
What?

615
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,894
Well, that you and Amyas would stop it.
Just stop it.

616
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:37,106
He has a wife and child.
His place is with them.

617
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,277
Oh, Meredith... (laughs)

618
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:46,949
After lunch,
they had coffee on the terrace.

619
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:51,787
Caroline took a cup down to Amyas,
and Miss Williams accompanied her.

620
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:54,916
I followed shortly afterwards,
I think to...

621
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:56,959
<i>... walk off my lunch.
- Mr. Blake!</i>

622
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:00,546
- Mr. Blake!
- What's wrong?

623
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:03,799
- A terrible thing!
- What on earth is it?

624
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:08,429
Mr. Crale... He's dead.

625
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:11,766
Would you be so kind as
to call a doctor?

626
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,142
My God!

627
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:24,237
(sound of running and panting)

628
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:28,074
Get a doctor! Quick!

629
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:29,742
- What?
- It's Amyas.

630
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:33,037
- What?
- I'm affraid he's dead.

631
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:37,959
Amyas!

632
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:40,294
Poor child.

633
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:45,841
She just just couldn't believe that
life could play so cruel a trick.

634
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:52,014
<i>Caroline stood there, quite calmly,
and said he must've done it to himself.</i>

635
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,560
So, you are perfectly convinced, Monsieur,
that she was guilty?

636
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:59,564
She was provoked, in the extreme.

637
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:05,528
- But you do not believe it was suicide?
- Caroline did it, I'm sure of it.

638
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:10,741
And anyway,

639
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:15,413
what if she didn't...

640
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:43,441
Hercule Poirot, Mademoiselle.

641
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,578
Lucy Crale...

642
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:59,332
She must have been very young
When you last saw her.

643
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:01,584
Seven and a half.

644
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,878
Charming.

645
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:08,341
A little too quiet.
Lived in a world of her own.

646
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,510
If you tell to me, please,
Mademoiselle,

647
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,514
her parents,
they were most devoted, yes?

648
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:17,099
One does occasionally find,
Monsieur Poirot,

649
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,810
a husband and wife
so wrapped up in each other

650
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:22,647
that the child
hardly seems to impinge.

651
00:50:22,772 --> 00:50:24,815
So, more like lovers
than husband and wife?

652
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:27,068
If that's how you wish to put it.

653
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:32,406
- Did you like Madame Crale?
- Yes, I was very fond of her.

654
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,492
And your pupil?

655
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:39,497
Angela was a most interesting
if difficult girl.

656
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:44,585
I cherish the belief that I've played a
modest part in her success.

657
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,964
Have you read her book
of the tombs in the Fayum?

658
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:52,468
- Sadly, <i>non.</i>
- It's compelling stuff. Read it.

659
00:50:52,593 --> 00:50:55,847
I guess. Yes, I  shall...

660
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,310
You must have been upset
when she was sent away to school.

661
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,354
No, no, not at all.

662
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:07,608
To her, home life was hardly
what would turn "ideal" .

663
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:10,736
Caroline indulged her,
Amyas got jealous,

664
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:15,283
he and Angela would fight, and she'd
end up playing some spiteful trick.

665
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:19,328
And though, of course,
far greater actions prevailed.

666
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,622
You mean Elsa Greer?

667
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:24,000
Exactly.

668
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,837
What was your opinion of her?

669
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:30,047
She was totally unprincipaled.

670
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:33,801
And also very much in love. His death
must have been for her a shock most terrible.

671
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:36,137
- And it was entirely her fault.
- Mademoiselle Greer?

672
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:39,640
The way she carried on.
She even had the insolence

673
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:41,726
<i>to suggest they were going to marry.</i>

674
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:47,607
- It's only fair that she should know.
- Amyas, is it true?

675
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:51,861
Then, it is.

676
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,783
<i>The look she gave him!
Magnificent!</i>

677
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:00,620
<i>And then she walked out,
head held high,</i>

678
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:03,414
her grace
and dignity unsolid.

679
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:07,835
- Was she aware of how much you admired her?
- I believe...

680
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:13,174
I hope that... I adequately
expressed my...

681
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:15,176
<i>... my support for her.</i>

682
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:18,930
- Mrs. Crale...
- Not now, Miss Williams.

683
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:22,475
- I just meant to tell...
- Another time, please.

684
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,977
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

685
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:29,649
- I think you're wonderful.
- Oh, but you don't know...

686
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:46,374
And then, Mademoiselle?

687
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:53,297
And then, they all went to tea
at Meredith Blake's.

688
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:57,718
And that evening, after dinner,
the usual arguments began

689
00:52:57,843 --> 00:52:59,762
about Angela and school.

690
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:03,391
Now, you listen! The fees are payed
the uniform's bought,

691
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:05,017
case closed!
- I'm not going!

692
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:07,770
It's a lovely school, darling.
It's right in the middle of the Downs.

693
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:10,106
I'm sure that you'll
make lots of nice friends.

694
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:11,566
I don't want any friends.

695
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:15,236
- You won't get any, if you carry on like this.
- Why do you want to get rid of me?

696
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:19,574
Nobody wants to get rid of you.
You know we all love you.

697
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:22,326
He doesn't! He won't care
if he doesn't see me again.

698
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,872
Right! All this screaming
like a fishwife...

699
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:29,917
- You know all about them!
- Now, look here, girlie...

700
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:32,587
- I wish you were dead!
- Angela!

701
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:47,351
I followed Angela to her room
e reprehended her sharply.

702
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,022
The next morning was so beautiful

703
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:55,193
that I fondly thought it might
restore some peace to our lives.

704
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:58,571
Little did I know it was
the harbinger of murder.

705
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,865
Angela!

706
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:05,369
<i>Angela had yet again disappeared,
I thought for a swim,</i>

707
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:09,248
but there were no signs of her.
So, I returned to the house.

708
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:14,629
Mrs  Crale was about to serve some beer
before lunch, so I offered to help her.

709
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:17,632
We went to the cellar, which was used
to cold storage.

710
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:22,720
<i>As we arrived, we found Angela,
behaving in a most suspicious manner.</i>

711
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:26,557
- What on earth are you doing with that?
- I was just...

712
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:29,685
I hope you weren't thinking
of drinking it.

713
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,522
I'll take, if you don't mind.

714
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:36,442
Would you mind serving the others?
I'll pop this down to Amyas.

715
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,240
And all this time Mlle. Greer
was sitting for Monsieur Crale?

716
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:43,991
Yes.

717
00:54:44,992 --> 00:54:50,039
- Oh, he got what he deserved.
- He acted very badly, <i>oui, c'est vrai.</i>

718
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:52,583
But he was...

719
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:58,506
- A great artiste, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>
- Great? Couldn't even draw.

720
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:01,717
His perspective was terrible,
The anathomy was all over the place...

721
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:05,429
I know what I'm talking about.
I studied art, as a girl, in Florence.

722
00:55:05,555 --> 00:55:07,557
Tell me, Mademoiselle,

723
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:11,727
you were with Madame Crale
when she discovered the body, yes?

724
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:14,856
No, not exactly.

725
00:55:15,147 --> 00:55:18,234
We went down from the house together,
after lunch.

726
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,319
<i>She was taking Mr. Crale some coffee,</i>

727
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:23,489
<i>and I was going to the beach
to look for Angela's jersey.</i>

728
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,701
<i>Amyas? Amyas!</i>

729
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:39,589
Mrs. Crale?

730
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,303
It's Amyas.

731
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:47,054
He's dead.

732
00:55:47,388 --> 00:55:50,141
- Mr. Blake! Mr. Blake!
- What's wrong?

733
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:54,520
<i>I bumped into Meredith Blake,
told him the terrible news,</i>

734
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:58,399
<i>and asked him
to telephone the doctor.</i>

735
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,777
<i>I was most concerned
about Mrs. Crale,</i>

736
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:04,530
<i>I didn't want her to be left alone.</i>

737
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:09,035
Did you get an impression about what
Madame Crale was thinking at the time?

738
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:15,374
It was impossible to tell.
She was stunned.

739
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:20,963
What view did she adopt
oficially as to his death?

740
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:22,340
Suicide.

741
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:26,719
- Even in private, to you?
- She had no doubt whatsoever.

742
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,100
And what did you say to her?

743
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:41,776
- Is that chair uncomfortable, Mlle.?
- It's perfectly comfortable, thank you.

744
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:46,697
- Tou were about to tell me...
- I-I- I think I said,

745
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:49,784
"Cnly, Mrs. Crale,
it must have been suicide" .

746
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,827
- Did you believe that?
- No, I did not.

747
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,830
But understand this:
I was entirely on her side.

748
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,416
- So you'd have liked to see her acquited?
- But of course I would.

749
00:56:57,583 --> 00:57:02,213
I woman of honor, of dignity,
hanged like a carcace in a butchershop!

750
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:09,303
Poor Lucy! Having to be confronted
by all of this!

751
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:12,306
Still, it is always better to face the truth.

752
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:15,935
But there's more to it than that. She wants
to prove her mother to be innocent.

753
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,938
Then, her wish will not
be granted.

754
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:22,400
Before she was hanged, Caroline Crale
wrote to her daughter a letter

755
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:25,736
in which she solemny swears
her inocence.

756
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:32,159
It would perhaps have been better...

757
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:35,079
... to tell her daughter not to judge.

758
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:39,333
- You seem very sure of her guilt.
- It's hard to believe otherwise.

759
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:43,880
- And yet you profess to have loved her.
- I did love her.

760
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:46,465
I did.

761
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:50,386
If that is all...

762
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,724
Yes, yes, of course.

763
00:57:56,934 --> 00:58:01,981
Thank you very much for your time,
Mademoiselle. You have been most helpful.

764
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:10,615
I know that she was guilty,
Monsieur.

765
00:58:12,116 --> 00:58:15,953
- Without a shadow of doubt.
- May I ask how?

766
00:58:16,704 --> 00:58:19,707
<i>After bumping into
Meredith Blake</i>

767
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:25,296
<i>and informing him of Mr. Crale's
death, I returned to the water garden.</i>

768
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,595
<i>Mrs. Crale was not in command of
herself , as I implied.</i>

769
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:37,683
<i>It was the fear in her face
that told me the truth.</i>

770
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:43,147
<i>That's when I knew
she had poisoned her husband.</i>

771
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:48,236
And I, for one, do not blame her.

772
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:55,117
She never knew what I'd seen,
and I never told her.

773
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:59,580
In fact, I never told anybody.

774
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:03,626
During the trial,
I was never asked a question

775
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,629
to which I returned an untrue answer,

776
00:59:06,754 --> 00:59:10,174
but I was guilty
of witholding certain facts.

777
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:13,719
And I do not repent of that,
Monsieur Poirot.

778
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:17,890
I would do so again.

779
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:34,866
... was in fact such a corrupt and venal
as the sociedade of today.

780
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:38,536
Since then, there have been
other other key  excavations,

781
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:43,708
but none as remarkable
as Chagar Bazar. Thank you.

782
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,546
Thank you so much for coming.

783
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,424
Thank you. Thank you.

784
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:57,263
Hercule Poirot, Mademoiselle.

785
00:59:58,222 --> 01:00:01,559
The Chagar Bazar digging
was quite simply extraordinary.

786
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:03,811
Did my account of it
in the "National Geographic"?

787
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:06,606
- Sadly no. I have not yet...
- Fairly definitive,

788
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:08,357
if I may say so myself.

789
01:00:08,983 --> 01:00:11,611
Little Lucy...
I'd so like to see her.

790
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:15,573
- You have not kept in contact?
- No, not nearly as much as I should've.

791
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,951
I think it's admirable that she wants
to clean her mother's name.

792
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:22,538
- Then, you approve it?
- Of course.

793
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:26,334
Caroline didn't do it.
I've always known that.

794
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:29,503
You surprise me, Mademoiselle.

795
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,090
- Everyone else with whom I have spoken...
- I know, I know.

796
01:00:33,382 --> 01:00:36,511
The circunstancial evidence
were overwhelming,

797
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:40,056
that's frankly why I never
tempted anything myself.

798
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:42,892
I knew my sister extremely well

799
01:00:43,017 --> 01:00:45,228
She quite simply
couldn't have killed anyone.

800
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:48,856
The human nature has the infinite
capacity to surprise .

801
01:00:50,149 --> 01:00:53,152
- Not in this instance.
- How can you be so certain?

802
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,029
Because I am.

803
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:58,241
But I'm affraid, Mademoiselle,
that would not stand up in court.

804
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,618
That's why I was never called
to give word in evidence.

805
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:04,288
- And if you had been...?
- This is why I know.

806
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:09,377
But for many,
that would prove the exact opposite.

807
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:13,506
As they claimed at the trial,
but this was a moment's rage

808
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:18,177
haunted her for the rest of her life.
She never forgave herself,

809
01:01:18,302 --> 01:01:21,180
as a result, she was
constantly on her garde.

810
01:01:21,305 --> 01:01:24,517
I don't say she was meek
or timid, quite the opposite,

811
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,937
but murder? Never! Never!

812
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:38,155
<i>It was an idillic summer
in so many ways...</i>

813
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:40,324
<i>... what I can remember of it.</i>

814
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:49,500
Oh, come on, Lucy, do shoot me!
That's all the point.

815
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:04,807
<i>If only that woman didn't
come into our lives...</i>

816
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:06,934
<i>All this pretense,</i>

817
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,644
<i>it's do dishonest.</i>

818
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:12,064
<i>Amyas and I love each other
and we're going to be married,</i>

819
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:14,317
<i>so I should be moving in.</i>

820
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,737
<i>Then, when Amyas came out...</i>

821
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:20,448
Why did Elsa say
she's going to marry you?

822
01:02:20,573 --> 01:02:23,117
- And how did you hear that?
- The window's open.

823
01:02:23,284 --> 01:02:25,119
It's damned rude eavesdropping.

824
01:02:25,244 --> 01:02:26,829
- But why did she say it?
- It was a joke.

825
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:29,415
- It's not very funny to me.
- Enough, all right?!

826
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:34,378
Come on. Come on.

827
01:02:37,215 --> 01:02:40,635
<i>And then, on our way to tea
at Meredith's, I confronted Caroline.</i>

828
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:43,262
- Is it true?
- What, darling?

829
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,432
Is Elsa going to marry Amyas?

830
01:02:48,392 --> 01:02:50,728
Only after I'm dead.

831
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,948
The rest of the day is blur.

832
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:06,327
Kinda remember Meredith reading
rather beautiful about Socrates...

833
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:11,332
" ... he said when it reached the
heart, Socrates would be gone."

834
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:14,627
<i>... and then Amyas and I having
a real humdinger after dinner.</i>

835
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:16,212
Now look here, girlie!

836
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:18,673
<i>I think I threw something
at him.</i>

837
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,093
And the next day,
the day it happened,

838
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:27,849
again it's all very vague, up until the
point Merry came panting down the path.

839
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:32,603
I kept saying to myself,
"Amyas is dead" .

840
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:35,523
But it didn't seem real.

841
01:03:36,732 --> 01:03:41,404
<i>Then the doctor came, the police
came, they brought him to the house.</i>

842
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:51,414
I want you to go to grandma's,
with Lucy.

843
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:53,916
No, no. I don't want to go.

844
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:57,587
- I want to stay with you.
- I know, my darling,

845
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:01,382
but it's best that you do. It'll
easier that way, believe me.

846
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:03,968
No, please,
I don't want to leave you.

847
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:07,471
For me, my darling, do it for me.

848
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,850
And you must try not to think about it.

849
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:15,563
There's nothing to worry about,

850
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,398
I promise.

851
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,869
<i>And that was
the last time I ever saw her.</i>

852
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,667
<i>The end of Summer...</i>

853
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,837
<i>... was the end of childhood.</i>

854
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,257
A few days later she was arrested.

855
01:04:43,382 --> 01:04:45,218
I was sent to school,
in Germany,

856
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:48,304
Lucy was sent to relatives,
in Canada.

857
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:55,144
Just before she was hanged, she wrote me
a letter. I've never shown it to anyone.

858
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:57,688
I think you should read it.

859
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:11,035
<i>Merci, Mademoiselle.</i>

860
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:14,580
<i>"My darling Angela,</i>

861
01:05:14,705 --> 01:05:17,959
<i>"I want you to know that
it is all alright.</i>

862
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:22,463
<i>"I've never lied to you, and I don't now
when I say that I'm happy,</i>

863
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:25,842
<i>that I feel a peace
that I've never known before."</i>

864
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:30,471
It's remarkable.

865
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:34,183
She was a remarkable person,
and innocent.

866
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:38,479
- But the letter does not say it explicitly.
- Because it didn't to say it.

867
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:42,316
Then, how do you think
Amyas Crale died?

868
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,318
Suicide.

869
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:48,906
- But is that not out of character?
- As you said before,

870
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:52,994
human nature has an infinite
capacity to surprise.

871
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,668
Then, you can see no other explanation?

872
01:06:00,793 --> 01:06:03,170
- You mean, someone else might have killed him?
<i>- Oui.</i>

873
01:06:03,337 --> 01:06:05,256
I think it unlikely.

874
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:09,135
But if, for one second,
we consider the possibility, what then...

875
01:06:09,343 --> 01:06:12,054
I would say Philip Blake
might be your man.

876
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,933
Now, that interests me very much,
mademoiselle. May I ask why?

877
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,853
I cannot see what possible motive
he could have.

878
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:22,273
He was the best friend
of Amyas Crale, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

879
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:25,943
Or were the two men rivals, perhaps, over Elsa?
- Not Elsa.

880
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,657
One night, that Summer,

881
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:35,286
<i>I got up, to get to the bathroom.
And, as I opened the door,</i>

882
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,831
<i>I saw Caroline coming out
from Philip's bedroom.</i>

883
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:44,337
She had a look on her face
at the time I didn't really understand.

884
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:46,964
- But, looking back...
- I got the impression,

885
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:49,383
from Monsieur Blake,
that always he disliked your sister.

886
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:54,263
I have, I confess, precious little experience
on the affairs of the heart,

887
01:06:54,388 --> 01:06:58,809
but what other explanation
could there possibly be?

888
01:07:15,952 --> 01:07:19,872
- This could be a disaster.
- You can trust me, Mademoiselle.

889
01:08:06,377 --> 01:08:13,676
♫ (gramophone music- flashback)

890
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:36,032
It warms my heart
to see you all together again.

891
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,660
Is Lucy joining us?

892
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:55,676
- This is very good of you, mrs. Spriggs.
- My pleasure, sir.

893
01:08:56,052 --> 01:08:57,678
It is, really.

894
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:03,184
I'm very proud of you,
my dear.

895
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:05,770
I wish someone would tell us
the point of all this.

896
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,281
If you will excuse me...

897
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,713
Lady Dittisham, I am delighted
that you could make it.

898
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:34,799
I hope it's worth it.

899
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:37,134
God, this place
is falling apart!

900
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:40,721
- Before we join the others...
- I'd kill for a Martini.

901
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,849
... we might have a little word?

902
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:46,561
- You don't let up, do you?
- To come straight to the point...

903
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,145
I'm pleased to hear it.

904
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:53,401
After the trial, did Meredith
Blake show any interest in you at all?

905
01:09:54,527 --> 01:10:00,074
Animals! Stupid
unthinking animals!

906
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:02,952
What a terrible ordeal
for you, my dear!

907
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,789
What a brave girl you are! Elsa,

908
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:11,252
I've had special feelings for you
ever since we met, you know?

909
01:10:11,377 --> 01:10:13,754
And now you're all alone in the world...

910
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:15,715
Do shut up!

911
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:20,136
- Weren't you surprised?
- Just vaguely nauseated.

912
01:10:20,928 --> 01:10:24,849
- Can I have my Martini now?
- But of course.

913
01:10:38,654 --> 01:10:41,449
Well... what a hoot!

914
01:10:56,047 --> 01:10:58,716
Can't one have a moment's peace?

915
01:10:58,841 --> 01:11:00,968
You were not entirely
honest with me

916
01:11:01,135 --> 01:11:03,888
when we had that little chat
in London.

917
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:07,225
- Is that so?
- Yes indeed, Monsieur Blake.

918
01:11:07,433 --> 01:11:09,644
On at least one night, during that Summer,

919
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:11,979
Madame Crale was seen
coming out of your room

920
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:14,732
at an hour somewhat compromising.

921
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:17,568
Who told you that?

922
01:11:19,403 --> 01:11:23,866
- It's none of your damn business.
- I am affraid that it is, Monsieur,

923
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:27,411
if this matter is to be laid to rest.

924
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:32,333
She thought she might
try it on.

925
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:37,880
He's going to leave me, I know he is.
I can't bare the thought of being without him.

926
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:42,593
Philip, Philip...

927
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:49,058
Sometimes I get so lonely
I feel I'm going mad.

928
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:53,145
She always thought she could get
what she wanted,

929
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,568
but that didn't wash with me.

930
01:12:00,611 --> 01:12:03,698
I think you better
go back to bed.

931
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:14,542
So, you see, when I said I didn't
like her, I wasn't telling fibs.

932
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:16,919
<i>Non.</i>

933
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:19,964
<i>Merci, Monsieur.</i>

934
01:12:26,137 --> 01:12:28,014
Actually...

935
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:33,728
It's not quite true.

936
01:12:34,353 --> 01:12:39,901
- Monsieur Blake, are you all-right?
- Everything was such a mess!

937
01:12:41,277 --> 01:12:45,948
Always has been,
ever since we were children.

938
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:49,702
She was always ready with
some sny remark.

939
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:55,666
Amyas and I...

940
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:58,419
<i>... we...</i>

941
01:13:00,004 --> 01:13:02,798
<i>... we were true friends.</i>

942
01:13:03,382 --> 01:13:05,927
<i>She couldn't stand him.</i>

943
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:10,056
<i>He meant everything to me.</i>

944
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:14,310
<i>Everything!</i>

945
01:13:20,441 --> 01:13:23,236
<i>Meredith knew, I think.</i>

946
01:13:24,737 --> 01:13:26,948
Caroline suspected.

947
01:13:28,699 --> 01:13:32,119
But nothing she could say
changed anything.

948
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:36,874
It's Amyas, isn't it? Still Amyas.

949
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,962
You just can't get him out of your head.

950
01:13:41,254 --> 01:13:44,215
Do you have any idea how pathetic you are?

951
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:50,555
It just made me hate her all the more.

952
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:04,777
I...

953
01:14:07,572 --> 01:14:10,741
... I trust you keep this to yourself.

954
01:14:11,826 --> 01:14:13,661
Of course.

955
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,292
Not that I care much, anyway.

956
01:14:49,071 --> 01:14:51,115
How kind of you to come.

957
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,496
Do you think you can get on
with the business in hand?

958
01:14:58,414 --> 01:15:02,043
Indeed, Monsieur,
I was about to suggest the very same.

959
01:15:07,798 --> 01:15:11,219
<i>Et alors,</i> where to begin, hmm?

960
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:13,971
As you know,

961
01:15:14,096 --> 01:15:17,183
it was my purpose to dicover the truth
about the murder of Amyas Crale.

962
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:20,811
- We all know the truth!
- Yes, indeed, Monsieur Blake,

963
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,357
but sometimes,
what we accept as the truth

964
01:15:24,482 --> 01:15:27,693
may not be the full story,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

965
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:32,740
And, sometimes,
it may not be true at all.

966
01:15:35,826 --> 01:15:40,289
<i>D'accord.</i> This is what I learned:

967
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:45,878
that, at no time did Caroline
Crale protest her innocence,

968
01:15:46,003 --> 01:15:48,548
except in a letter to her daughter;

969
01:15:48,714 --> 01:15:51,259
that, in the Dock,
she showed no fear;

970
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:54,887
that, in a letter to her sister,
she expressed acquiescence to her fate;

971
01:15:55,012 --> 01:16:00,059
and that, in the opinion of everyone...
<i>Pardon,</i> with one exception, most notable,

972
01:16:00,184 --> 01:16:03,479
Caroline Crale was guilty.
- Of course she was!

973
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:06,148
But it was not for me to accept
the verdict of others.

974
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:09,443
<i>Non,</i> it was necessary
for me to examine the facts,

975
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:13,990
and to ensure that
the psycology of this case

976
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:16,450
accorded itself with them.

977
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:19,078
There's no doubt whatever that
she had ample motive

978
01:16:19,203 --> 01:16:22,206
and much of the evidence,
it tells against her:

979
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:24,500
the scent bottle
discovered in her room;

980
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:27,587
the poison she admitted to steal;

981
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,133
the row with her husband,
where she threatened to kill him.

982
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:39,557
None of this seems incorrect,
psychologically.

983
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:44,896
But, then, we come to something
that does not quite ring true.

984
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:49,817
After Meredith Blake discovers
the poison is missing,

985
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:52,695
he rows over here to discuss it
with his brother.

986
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:57,700
<i>On their way up to the house, they overhear
a discussion between Caroline and her husband</i>

987
01:16:57,825 --> 01:17:01,412
<i>on the vexed subject of Angela
being sent away to school.</i>

988
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:03,539
<i>It's shameful behavior, Amyas!</i>

989
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:07,335
<i>- You're being so hard on her.
- We'll discuss this after lunch.</i>

990
01:17:08,252 --> 01:17:12,006
<i>- I'll see to her packing.</i>
- That does strike me as odd.

991
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:16,010
They just had a row most horrific
in which she has threatened to kill him,

992
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:20,473
and then, a short time later, they are
having an argument relatively trivial

993
01:17:20,598 --> 01:17:23,851
in which Monsieur Crale says
he will see to Angela's packing.

994
01:17:23,976 --> 01:17:26,771
Now, does that not strike you as strange?

995
01:17:27,146 --> 01:17:29,190
Why should he do her packing?

996
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:32,318
When there is her sister, or the
governess, or the housekeeper?

997
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:35,613
I did not know Monsieur Crale,

998
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:39,242
But you know, somehow I can not picture him
folding neatly

999
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:45,081
the skirts, the blouses, or the underwear.
Another thing that striked as odd:

1000
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:49,210
having just threatened to kill him,

1001
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:54,131
Caroline Crale offers to bring to
her husband a cold beer.

1002
01:17:54,257 --> 01:17:57,760
- Dissimulation.
- You think so?

1003
01:17:58,135 --> 01:18:02,515
But if she intends to poison him,
wouldn't it be more inteligent to...

1004
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:05,101
What is the word?

1005
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:11,399
"Spike" the supply of beer
that he has on the water garden,

1006
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:14,151
when no-one was about, hmm?

1007
01:18:14,277 --> 01:18:18,823
<i>Alors,</i> Caroline Crale brings
to him a beer from the house,

1008
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:20,741
he drinks it, he says,

1009
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:26,372
"Everything tastes foul today", and
after lunch she finds him dead.

1010
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:29,125
- We know all this.
<i>- Oui, oui, bien sûr.</i>

1011
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:34,005
But now, I offer some information
which is new.

1012
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:39,802
<i>After asking Meredith Blake
to call for a doctor,</i>

1013
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:43,097
<i>Mademoiselle Williams
returns to the water garden.</i>

1014
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,770
- You actually saw her do that?
- Well, that settles it.

1015
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:51,230
Not necessarilly.

1016
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:54,317
- That is what I saw.
- And only your word for it.

1017
01:18:54,442 --> 01:18:57,111
I'm not accustomed
to having my word doubted.

1018
01:18:57,236 --> 01:18:59,614
And I do not doubt it,
Mademoiselle Williams.

1019
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,701
I believe that what you saw took place
exactly as you say that it did,

1020
01:19:03,868 --> 01:19:06,245
and, because of what you saw,

1021
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:10,791
I know that Caroline Crale
was not guilty.

1022
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:14,420
- Well, how the hell did you work that out?
- Do calm down.

1023
01:19:14,545 --> 01:19:17,965
I will tell to you. Mademoiselle
Williams saw Caroline Crale

1024
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,635
wipe off the fingerprints
from the beer bottle

1025
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:25,473
and impose the prints of her husband
onto it... Onto the bottle, mark.

1026
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:29,727
But the conium was in the glass,
not the bottle.

1027
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:33,481
The police found no traces of it in the bottle.
No conium had ever been in the bottle.

1028
01:19:34,982 --> 01:19:37,318
And Caroline Crale, she did not know that .

1029
01:19:37,443 --> 01:19:42,323
She, who has poisoned her husband,
did not know how he had been poisoned?

1030
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:47,578
- So, why make it look like suicide?
- Because she knew who was the culprit

1031
01:19:47,745 --> 01:19:52,041
and she would do anythining rather
rather then let that person be suspected.

1032
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:57,213
So, who could it be?

1033
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:02,176
There was only one person

1034
01:20:02,593 --> 01:20:06,931
whom she would be willing to protect
at all costs.

1035
01:20:10,059 --> 01:20:15,189
Mademoiselle Warren, I would like
to read the letter your sister wrote you.

1036
01:20:15,356 --> 01:20:16,983
No!

1037
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:19,569
- But, Mademoiselle...
- I realize what you are suggesting

1038
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:23,114
and I deny it utterly. That letter
was meant for my eyes only.

1039
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:24,907
- Aunt Angela, please...
- No!

1040
01:20:26,033 --> 01:20:28,411
For my mother's sake.

1041
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:31,122
Please.

1042
01:20:44,385 --> 01:20:46,596
<i>Merci, Mademoiselle.</i>

1043
01:20:48,598 --> 01:20:50,975
"My darling Angela,

1044
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,897
"I want you to know that it is al alright.

1045
01:20:57,106 --> 01:21:01,903
"I have never lied to you, and I don't now
when I say that I am happy,

1046
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:06,741
that I feel a peace that I've never
known before." (Caroline's voice)

1047
01:21:06,866 --> 01:21:09,785
<i>Don't look back,
and don't grieve for me.</i>

1048
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:12,371
<i>Live your life and succed.</i>

1049
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:17,126
<i>It's all alright, my darling,
it's all alright.</i>

1050
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:20,838
<i>I'm going to Amyas and I'm happy,</i>

1051
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:25,384
<i>and you must be too.
One has to pay one's debts.</i>

1052
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,970
"Your loving sister, Caroline."

1053
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:32,141
<i>It is a beautiful letter, non?</i>

1054
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:36,938
And also quite remakable, for it contains
one omission that is most tracking.

1055
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:41,192
There is no protestation of innocence.

1056
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:43,694
- Because it was unnecessary.
<i>- Oui, bien sûr.</i>

1057
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:45,738
Because she thought her sister
knew that she was innocent

1058
01:21:45,863 --> 01:21:48,407
for the best of possible reasons!
And her only concern

1059
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:53,704
was to comfort, to reassure, and to advert
of you having to confess.

1060
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:56,624
"It's all alright, my darling,

1061
01:21:56,749 --> 01:21:59,961
it's all alright."

1062
01:22:00,086 --> 01:22:02,713
She wanted me to be happy,
it's as simple as that.

1063
01:22:02,839 --> 01:22:06,133
Yes indeed, and so that the burden
of your guilt may not be too great,

1064
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:08,803
she tells to you,
"One must pay one's debts" .

1065
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:12,139
And now, she has, at last, the chance
to repay you the debt she has to you

1066
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:14,559
for the injury she caused you
all those years before.

1067
01:22:14,725 --> 01:22:18,563
And now the trial, the sentence, pff!
Nothing can touch her,

1068
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:21,816
because, finally,
she felt redeemed.

1069
01:22:21,941 --> 01:22:27,446
She felt at peace with herself.

1070
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,244
And in the light of this,

1071
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:37,999
everything falls into place.

1072
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:40,334
- Now look here, girlie...
- I wish you were dead.

1073
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:43,588
<i>When Angela threw
the paperweight at Amyas Crale,</i>

1074
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:47,758
<i>the memory that haunts her
is brought to life most vividly.</i>

1075
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:51,721
<i>Then, in the next morning, she sees
Angela tempering with the beer...</i>

1076
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:54,223
I'll take it, if you don't mind.

1077
01:22:57,768 --> 01:23:01,939
<i>... which she then brings to Amyas.
- Tastes foul.</i>

1078
01:23:02,648 --> 01:23:05,985
<i>- Everything's foul today.
- And after lunch,</i>

1079
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,405
she finds him dead.

1080
01:23:11,282 --> 01:23:14,285
<i>Alors,</i> she is convinced
he has been poisoned,

1081
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:19,290
but who could have done it?
And then, suddenly,

1082
01:23:19,415 --> 01:23:21,417
it its her.

1083
01:23:22,168 --> 01:23:25,087
The resentment of Angela over the school,
the desaproval of Elsa,

1084
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:27,757
her rage on the night before,
her tempering with the beer.

1085
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:31,302
And she remembers also well

1086
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:37,016
her own violent emotions at that age.

1087
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:44,273
So yes, Angela.
It has to be!

1088
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:51,280
And the one thought
that springs into her mind...

1089
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,869
... is how to protect her.

1090
01:23:58,621 --> 01:24:01,582
<i>So, she wipes the fingerprints
from the bottle,</i>

1091
01:24:01,707 --> 01:24:04,377
<i>puts her husband's there
to make it look like suicíde,</i>

1092
01:24:04,502 --> 01:24:07,171
<i>sends Angela out of the country
as soon as possible,</i>

1093
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,299
<i>hoping, against hope,</i>

1094
01:24:10,424 --> 01:24:13,344
<i>that she does not confess.</i>

1095
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:16,514
But if I'd have done it,
of course I'd have confessed.

1096
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,433
I'd never let Caroline
suffer for what I'd done.

1097
01:24:19,559 --> 01:24:24,522
- But you did temper with the beer, did you not?
- I can't remember that!

1098
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:28,609
Monsieur Blake, you said that
you heard a noise in the laboratory

1099
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:32,446
in the morning of the murder.
- Yes, just probably a cat.

1100
01:24:32,613 --> 01:24:37,076
Or probably not. I would suggest rather,
it was someone who got in through

1101
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:40,204
the sash window
and took something from the shelf.

1102
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:42,039
The valerian!

1103
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:46,002
To put in Amyas' drink!
I remember taking it.

1104
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:47,837
Angela!

1105
01:24:47,962 --> 01:24:50,715
- Was it really that day?
<i>- Oui, Mademoiselle.</i>

1106
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:55,386
- This is valerian.
- The one that cats like?

1107
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:56,846
They can't get enough of it.

1108
01:24:56,971 --> 01:25:00,641
And it was the description given by Monsieur
Blake which gave to you the idea.

1109
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:05,646
Yes, I remeber getting out some
beer and Caroline...

1110
01:25:05,938 --> 01:25:08,816
... catching me before I could put
the stuff in it.

1111
01:25:08,941 --> 01:25:12,403
I never connected it
with that particular day.

1112
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:15,823
She thought it was me!

1113
01:25:23,414 --> 01:25:25,625
Oh! I didn't kill him.

1114
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,378
- I didn't kill him.
- Of course not, my dear.

1115
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:32,131
Can't you see she's telling the truth?

1116
01:25:32,256 --> 01:25:36,427
I see it quite clearly,
because I know very well who killed him.

1117
01:25:36,552 --> 01:25:39,639
Don't you think
you're milking it a bit, old man?

1118
01:25:39,972 --> 01:25:42,767
It is the older story in the world:

1119
01:25:42,892 --> 01:25:45,978
two women and one man.

1120
01:25:46,145 --> 01:25:48,940
What we have taken for granted
is that the man would leave his wife

1121
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:50,942
for the other woman.

1122
01:25:51,317 --> 01:25:54,654
But I would like to suggest here now
is that he had no intention of doing

1123
01:25:54,695 --> 01:25:55,863
anything of that kind.

1124
01:25:55,988 --> 01:25:59,116
After all, the women he had
fallen in love with in the past

1125
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:03,704
never expected too much from him,
but this time it was different.

1126
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:07,500
She was just a girl,

1127
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:11,045
who saw the world in black and white.

1128
01:26:11,212 --> 01:26:13,756
She had the passion for him,

1129
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:16,133
and so assumed he had for her.

1130
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,178
She assumed, without question,
it was for life,

1131
01:26:19,303 --> 01:26:21,681
so, naturally, he would leave his wife.

1132
01:26:21,806 --> 01:26:24,725
- He said he would.
- Well, a little white lie, perhaps.

1133
01:26:24,851 --> 01:26:26,853
All he really wanted
was to finish the painting,

1134
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:30,398
and nothing could be allowed to stand
in the way. And when Elsa Greer

1135
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:32,900
let the cat from the bag,
he was furious,

1136
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,820
but he was not concerned unduly.

1137
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:39,490
After all, Caroline had only
to put up with things for a few days longer,

1138
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:45,162
then he would tell her the truth, and
she would believe him, as so often before.

1139
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:51,252
And Elsa Greer? She would get over it
soon enough.

1140
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:56,507
But by that last evening, I believe that
he was getting worried

1141
01:26:56,674 --> 01:27:01,262
that Caroline Crale was taking things
more seriously than usual.

1142
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:06,225
And, by the following morning,
I think he had decided to come clean.

1143
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,895
You're the only woman in my life, Carol.

1144
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,647
You always were, you always will be,.
You know that.

1145
01:27:11,772 --> 01:27:15,359
She is nothing to me. Nothing.

1146
01:27:16,194 --> 01:27:20,281
She was, yes. She knocked me for six
to start with, but now is gone.

1147
01:27:20,406 --> 01:27:25,369
It's over. I swear to God.
She's just a kid.

1148
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:29,999
A passing fancy, that's all.

1149
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:35,421
You and your women!
Someday I'll kill you, Amyas.

1150
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:38,174
- Don't be an idiot.
- I swear to God I will!

1151
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:49,477
<i>What he did not know</i>

1152
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:53,439
<i>was that Elsa Greer
had overheard every word.</i>

1153
01:27:54,732 --> 01:28:00,363
And the account that she gave to me
of the conversation was not the true one.

1154
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:03,157
You're very sure of yourself,
aren't you, Monsieur Poirot?

1155
01:28:03,282 --> 01:28:07,119
Of this, Lady Dittisham, yes, I am.

1156
01:28:07,286 --> 01:28:10,248
<i>When Amyas Crale came down
and said he wanted to get on,</i>

1157
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:12,917
you said you had to go and change.

1158
01:28:13,084 --> 01:28:17,004
Which you did... eventually.

1159
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:22,593
I wonder you'd realized how angry
was Madame Crale with her husband

1160
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,596
for his treatment of you?
- How very touching.

1161
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:29,350
<i>When Philip Blake encountered her
coming out of the library...</i>

1162
01:28:29,517 --> 01:28:31,894
- Good morning.
- It's too cruel, too cruel.

1163
01:28:32,144 --> 01:28:34,856
<i>... it was of you she was thinking.</i>

1164
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,985
<i>I wonder what she would have thought
had she known that,</i>

1165
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,778
<i>at that very moment,</i>

1166
01:28:40,903 --> 01:28:44,657
<i>you were in her room
preparing to murder her husband</i>

1167
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:47,743
<i>and put the blame on her?</i>

1168
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:52,456
You see, something else
that I am sure of, Lady Dittisham,

1169
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:55,042
is that in the laboratory,
in the previous afternoon,

1170
01:28:55,168 --> 01:28:58,379
you would have seen Caroline Crale
steel the poison.

1171
01:28:58,504 --> 01:29:02,091
<i>Monsieur Blake had his back
to the room when he was talking to you,</i>

1172
01:29:02,258 --> 01:29:05,219
<i>so, it was perfectly possible
for you to see her,</i>

1173
01:29:05,344 --> 01:29:07,555
<i>the only person who could do so.</i>

1174
01:29:07,763 --> 01:29:11,184
Sorry, Merri. It's such a fascinating
colection...

1175
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:17,190
<i>And once you had the poison,
you went to join Amyas in the garden,</i>

1176
01:29:18,566 --> 01:29:20,860
<i>poured him some beer...</i>

1177
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:26,782
To my Mona Lisa.

1178
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:30,828
<i>... and he tossed it back,
in his usual manner.</i>

1179
01:29:31,162 --> 01:29:32,997
My darling Amyas.

1180
01:29:33,414 --> 01:29:35,958
<i>As he painted, you watched
and watched,</i>

1181
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:39,795
<i>waiting for the poison to take its efect.
A short time later,</i>

1182
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:44,884
<i>you went to fetch a shawl and Caroline Crale
again took the opportunity...</i>

1183
01:29:45,092 --> 01:29:47,428
<i>... to confront her husband
on your behalf.</i>

1184
01:29:47,553 --> 01:29:50,181
It's shameful, your behavior, Amyas!
You're being too hard on her.

1185
01:29:50,306 --> 01:29:53,976
For God's sake! It's all settled.
I'll send her packing.

1186
01:29:54,101 --> 01:29:58,356
And it was this that the Blake brothers
misheard, on their way up from the jetty.

1187
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:01,943
An error that is understandable,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1188
01:30:02,193 --> 01:30:04,570
You, then,
returned with a shawl,

1189
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:08,032
and then Caroline Crale,
she plates straight into your hands,

1190
01:30:08,157 --> 01:30:11,994
<i>for she brought to her husband
a bottle of cold beer.</i>

1191
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:15,540
It tastes foul!
Everything tastes foul today.

1192
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:18,626
"Everything tastes foul today" ,

1193
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:23,548
which suggests that he had tasted
something else unpleasant

1194
01:30:23,673 --> 01:30:26,592
before the beer that Caroline Crale
had brought to him.

1195
01:30:26,717 --> 01:30:30,763
<i>And so, you sat, and posed,</i>

1196
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:33,766
<i>and chatted, and waved
to Meredith Blake.</i>

1197
01:30:33,891 --> 01:30:35,977
<i>You played your part
beautifully!</i>

1198
01:30:36,102 --> 01:30:37,520
Bloody rheumatism!

1199
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:42,316
... while Amyas Crale painted on, and on,
until his limbs failed,

1200
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:45,945
and his speech thickened,
and he layed sprawled on the bench,

1201
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,531
helpless, with his mind still clear!

1202
01:30:50,157 --> 01:30:53,494
<i>And when Meredith Blake appeared
from the shadowy path onto the sunny garden,</i>

1203
01:30:53,619 --> 01:30:55,913
<i>he could not see clearly.</i>

1204
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,126
<i>Only his friend
turning slowly around,</i>

1205
01:31:00,251 --> 01:31:05,715
<i>unable to covey the fact that he was
in the grip of a paralysis that was fatal.</i>

1206
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:10,094
<i>En route</i> to the house,
you crushed the pipet on the foot,

1207
01:31:10,219 --> 01:31:13,347
<i>the traces of which
the police were to find.</i>

1208
01:31:15,183 --> 01:31:18,186
And then went to lunch,

1209
01:31:18,936 --> 01:31:22,064
leaving Amyas Crale
to his fate.

1210
01:31:28,738 --> 01:31:31,115
Thank you, Monsieur Poirot.

1211
01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:33,451
Mademoiselle.

1212
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:55,806
Amyas dead,

1213
01:31:56,891 --> 01:31:59,435
Caroline hanged...

1214
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:03,689
After all these years...

1215
01:32:04,815 --> 01:32:07,151
After all these years!

1216
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:26,379
You're very clever, aren't you?

1217
01:32:27,296 --> 01:32:30,675
I hope you don't expect me to confess.

1218
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:34,804
So, what are you going to do?

1219
01:32:35,221 --> 01:32:37,765
I shall do what I can to induce
the appropriate authorities

1220
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:41,435
to grant to Caroline Crale
a postumous free pardon.

1221
01:32:41,686 --> 01:32:46,399
And me?
What're you going to do about me?

1222
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:51,112
I shall lay my conclusions
before the necessary people.

1223
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:54,574
If they decide there is
a case against you, they may act.

1224
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:57,326
But, it is my opinion...

1225
01:33:00,246 --> 01:33:03,583
... that the evidence
is not suficient.

1226
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:08,045
Inferences only, not facts.

1227
01:33:08,546 --> 01:33:13,134
Moreover, I believe they won't be
anxious to proceed against a...

1228
01:33:14,468 --> 01:33:17,430
... person in your position.

1229
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:21,726
When I saw Caroline take the conium,
I thought she meant to kill herself.

1230
01:33:22,518 --> 01:33:26,439
But in the next morning, when I
overheard them talking about me, I...

1231
01:33:28,232 --> 01:33:30,526
I loved him...

1232
01:33:31,944 --> 01:33:35,239
... and he was just stringing me along.

1233
01:33:35,364 --> 01:33:38,242
And she felt sorry for me.

1234
01:33:38,618 --> 01:33:44,165
I watched him die, Monsieur Poirot.
And I never felt more alive,

1235
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:48,586
but what I didn't understand
was that I was killing myself.

1236
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:53,049
It was as if they hadn't died at all,

1237
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,635
but I had.

1238
01:34:03,142 --> 01:34:05,937
I died, Monsieur Poirot.

1239
01:34:24,831 --> 01:34:26,415
Elsa!

1240
01:34:30,419 --> 01:34:32,463
Come on then, Lucy.

1241
01:34:33,256 --> 01:34:37,468
Shoot me. You know you want to.

1242
01:34:37,593 --> 01:34:40,638
Do not listen to her, Mademoiselle.

1243
01:34:42,139 --> 01:34:44,058
That's right.

1244
01:34:46,978 --> 01:34:49,313
Just pull the trigger.

1245
01:34:51,816 --> 01:34:55,486
If you do, she will have won.

1246
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,488
Come on, do it.

1247
01:34:58,948 --> 01:35:03,369
- You're not affraid, are you?
- If you kill her, you kill yourself.

1248
01:35:03,494 --> 01:35:06,914
Just one little squeeze,
that's all it takes.

1249
01:35:07,165 --> 01:35:11,752
Spare her, Mademoiselle,
and justice may still be done.

1250
01:35:14,046 --> 01:35:15,590
Lucy, shoot me!
