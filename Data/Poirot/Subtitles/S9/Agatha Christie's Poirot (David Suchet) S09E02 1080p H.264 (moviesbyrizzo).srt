1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,422
"Gentlemen of the jury,

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:10,761
"we have presented
copious, clear evidence

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,598
"that Elinor Carlisle,
who stands before you,

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,437
"is a vicious, multiple murderess

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,027
"and one who shows not
the slightest feeling of remorse.

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>No remorse.</i>

7
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,618
<i>That's right.
I feel nothing.</i>

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,538
<i>Why should I?</i>

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>When you have wanted someone dead,
longed for it,</i>

10
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,214
<i>planned it
and watched</i>

11
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:51,635
<i>'til you see
the last flicker of life in the eyes...</i>

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,889
<i>We ask you now to contemplate
the full horror</i>

13
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>of the second cold-blooded
murder,</i>

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,477
wickedly
planned and executed

15
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,897
on a hot afternoon
at Hunterbury.

16
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>The deadly salmon paste
so thickly spread...</i>

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,573
<i>He is trying to see just exactly
why I did it,</i>

18
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,284
<i>what I felt...</i>

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>All of it seems
so inevitable now,</i>

20
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>as if it began
years and years ago.</i>

21
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,003
<i>And yet,
it was only last summer.</i>

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>The beginning.</i>

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>The beginning seemed happy.</i>

24
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,605
- Are the roses alright?
- They're lovely.

25
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>Good. I try to be
a respectable fiancé.</i>

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,444
And you are!

27
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,698
Soon, even theses extended
lunch hours will be respectable.

28
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,957
So, if I go to France
for two weeks,

29
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,628
you can meet me in "Le Tourquet".

30
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,339
<i>Ma maman</i> will be back than.
It'll be all very respectible

31
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,133
and we'll be back for
Astor's Autumn Ball.

32
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,927
How about it?

33
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,429
Elinor?

34
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,515
Oh, it sounds perfect.

35
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,685
But there's something else
on your mind, isn't there?

36
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,065
Oh Roddy, you know me so well.

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,485
Yes. Something arrived this morning.

38
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,530
It's stupid, but I can't take it
out of my mind.

39
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,157
I'm intrigued...

40
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,994
Is it a bill?

41
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,497
After all, it's the height of Summer
when the fairies dance

42
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,112
"To warn you: Someone's sucking up
to your aunt in Hunterbury

43
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,115
<i>"so you and your fiancé
get cut out of the will.</i>

44
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,660
"The person may seem as white
as snow,

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:26,123
"but wants to cheat you both and the old lady
will die with another stroke any day."

46
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,042
God...

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,007
It can't be true. It's just someone
out to cause trouble.

48
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,555
Yes, you're probably right.
It was quite a shock, though.

49
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,017
We haven't been down there this month.

50
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,478
- Yes, we should go.
- Because of this?

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,565
No, not just this...

52
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,695
You care for her. So do I.
But the house matters.

53
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,489
Think of the summers
we spent there as children.

54
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,283
She always said she wanted
one of us to have it.

55
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,577
Which means both of us,
now that we're engaged.

56
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,413
So, what in Heaven's name is wrong
with us making sure?

57
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,084
- Oh, Roddy! I'd love to go there.
- Then it's settled .

58
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,926
I decided to bring the letter, after all.
I want to show it to Dr. Lord.

59
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,805
You sure that's wise?

60
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,934
Yes. If anyone knows
who sent it, he would.

61
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,062
But, darling, it's so poisonous.

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,735
Oh well, if you must.
I still say you should burn it.

63
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,579
Do you know what I'd like?

64
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,790
Sometime when we're married
and living here together,

65
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,793
we send all the servants away
and we'll exactly what we want.

66
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,878
Oh, yes? And what about your meals?

67
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,464
We'll eat with our fingers
by the fire.

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
We won't have anybody
to disturb us.

69
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,554
Just you and me
and the wind in the trees.

70
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,066
Where is Ms. Bishop?

71
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,986
Somewhere. The hall
was always so dark.

72
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,323
Good Lord...

73
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,245
I never did get used to this lift.

74
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,290
It's a shame she doesn't use it now.

75
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,250
She doesn't even come out
of her room anymore.

76
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,378
Miss Carlisle, Mr. Winter...
I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,177
The nurses are coping well, though

78
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,971
her last stroke did take your aunt
so badly.

79
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,767
And look, here's another great help.

80
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,061
She's just back from her
studies in Germany.

81
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,981
You must both remember Mary,
the gardener's daughter.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,193
Hello, Elinor, Roddy...

83
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,697
Hello, Mary. Well, it's been a while...

84
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,659
Hello, Miss Carlisle, Mr. Winter...
How good to see you.

85
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,039
Well, she's not so bad today.
But she may be asleep, now.

86
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,458
- Would you like to go in?
- Yes, I think so.

87
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,627
Would you excuse us, please.

88
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,380
Thank you, nurse Hopkins.

89
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,674
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh, no thank you. I don't drink tea.

90
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,679
- Mr. Winter?
- Yes, please.

91
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,479
Elinor!

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,814
Aunt Laura!

93
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,277
I thought you were sleeping.

94
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,740
No, lying here like a captive,
as usual.

95
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:53,664
"Come away, death, and in
the sad cypress let me be laid."

96
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,333
Morbid as ever.

97
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,669
It gets me through.

98
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,880
Roddy! How lovely!

99
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:09,513
I am so pleased you are engaged.

100
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,767
Aan I know your parents
would have been too.

101
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,938
About time, I thought.
It's wonderful to see you, aunt Laura.

102
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,941
- You look fine.
- No, I don't.

103
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,280
Roddy, I'm quite sure you need
some refreshment.

104
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,659
And I want to have a little talk
with your bride-to-be.

105
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,287
Fine. I'll look in on you later.

106
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,873
But don't go pulling her of me

107
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,876
or I'll make a point of moving in here
wailing from your battlements.

108
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,134
Did you see Mary?

109
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,722
Yes. I was astonished.
When did she get back?

110
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,935
A few weeks ago.
I'm sure I told you.

111
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,147
Isn't she beautiful?

112
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,485
I am so glad she has
come back from Germany.

113
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,699
She has been very good to me.

114
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,996
And I am so pleased
that you and Roddy are together.

115
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,834
You do care for him?

116
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,377
Of course I do.

117
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:27,257
- Enough and not too much?
- What?

118
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:32,513
It's just something we used to say.

119
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,266
You should never care
too much for a man.

120
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:42,189
Aunt Laura, tell me
something, honestly.

121
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:49,279
Do you think love is ever
a happy thing?

122
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:58,455
Oh, Elinor! Perhaps it always brings
more sorrow than joy.

123
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,708
But who could do without it?

124
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:08,048
Anyone who has never really loved,
hasn't lived.

125
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,058
<i>And now Miss Carlisle's here
with her fiancé.</i>

126
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,644
<i>Miss Carlisle is still in there
with her now.</i>

127
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>- Miss Carlisle, the niece?
- Exactly.</i>

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,275
Never was that sure about her.

129
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,734
No?

130
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,236
Tries too hard.

131
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,613
And they call them
"kissing cousins" in "The Tatler".

132
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,241
But she's lucky to have caught him
and she knows it.

133
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,702
Behind the eyes,
she's nervous as a kitten.

134
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,709
I remember I was dripping in sweat.
I could hardly hold on.

135
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,086
But you did. You got
right to the top, didn't you?

136
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,297
I think you must've
got to your grip.

137
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,133
I couldn't help it. My hands
were slipping with the perspiration.

138
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,594
And then you fell at my feet laughing.

139
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,392
Oh! Hello, Elinor. We were just
remembering the old times.

140
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,437
Of course. We'll have
lots to talk about.

141
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,898
There's tea in the dining toom.

142
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,407
Now, look here, doctor, I've
said this before.

143
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:20,621
In any civilized country,
I'd just say I wanted to end it,

144
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:25,417
and you would finish me off
with some nice painless drug.

145
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,962
Well, I am not sure
if I wish to be hanged just yet.

146
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,548
Not now, you're doing so well.

147
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,552
Leave me all your money
and I might reconsider, if you like.

148
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,638
Boo humbug...

149
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,475
And who were you looking at?

150
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,603
Hum... your niece.

151
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,357
Elinor?
That reminds me,

152
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,110
she wants to see you before you go.

153
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,493
So, what do tou think of her, hey?

154
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,623
She is, uh... she's very impressive.

155
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,837
Yes... Very impressive...
Yes, she is.

156
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,592
You know, you ought to
get married, doctor.

157
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,937
I'm sorry. I just couldn't think
of anyone else to take on confidence.

158
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,608
No, no... I'm flattered.
But you're right, this is a horrible thing.

159
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,195
I supose it must be
someone in the village.

160
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,781
But who could the letter be referring to?

161
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,784
Who has access to our aunt
other than the nurses?

162
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,289
Well, Ted Horlick, the gardiner,
he helps to carry the oxygen.

163
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,627
Ms. Bishop goes in, the vicar, myself...
Mary Gerrard is there a lot, of course.

164
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,171
Nurse O'Brien lives in

165
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,215
and nurse Hopkins
comes everyday.

166
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,010
I suppose Mary is the newest here.

167
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,889
Can somebody be jealous of her?
Does she have a suiter?

168
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,849
I don't think so,

169
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,811
though Ted Horlick always
did have a soft spot for her.

170
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,314
It's probably nothing to do with her!

171
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,401
I'm sorry, somehow a thing like this
just plays on your nerves.

172
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,655
Just the idea of having someone
spying and trying to cause bad feelings...

173
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,824
Yes, it's probably best forgotten.

174
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,869
You have been kind,
but it's idiotic from me

175
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,748
asking you to play detective.
Shall we just burn it?

176
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,751
No, no. Nobody need to play detective.

177
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,754
I know a real one,
his name is Poirot.

178
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,839
<i>He's staying here a few days</i>

179
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,467
<i>preparing evidence
for a trial in Manbury.</i>

180
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:43,263
<i>He's horribly bored. And I'm sure
he'd leap at the chance of some diversion.</i>

181
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,266
<i>He has some peculiarities,</i>

182
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,894
<i>like his many herbal teas.</i>

183
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,522
<i>He's charming and very,
very discreet.</i>

184
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,774
<i>Mon ami...</i>

185
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,236
A doctor who bares a message
is always a sight most worrying.

186
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,321
I hope it isn't from none
of my physicians.

187
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,198
Of course not, Poirot.
How are you?

188
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,034
You settled in alright?
Are you any more comfortable?

189
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,829
Well, for some maybe.
As for me, well, I have my work.

190
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:11,959
What pleasure is there for me in the
evidence of a case I solved one year since?

191
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,545
None. I am, as you say,
bored to the tears.

192
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,881
Well, perhaps I can help. You see,
a lady, whom I admire a good deal

193
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,009
has come to me with a problem:
an anonimous letter.

194
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,888
You mean I'll maybe
a little exercise at last?

195
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,891
Well, don't get too excited,
I'm sure it's trivial.

196
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,396
There goes Ted Horlick
with Mary Gerrard.

197
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,773
She is in great favour
to Hunterbury House.

198
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,150
This letter is about that household.

199
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,404
It's a grand film. It's with
Garbo and it's set in Paris.

200
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,573
I'm sorry, Ted, I've already said no.

201
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,326
- You've set your eyes in someone else?
- No. Of course not. I'm sorry.

202
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,163
- <i>Bon,</i> enter if you please.
- Thank you.

203
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,670
The writer of this
has been very careful.

204
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,338
That interests you?

205
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,763
<i>Oh, oui!</i> Regard the pressure
on the page.

206
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,311
Now regard the words.

207
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:18,275
There is malice here, or, just as
concearning, the pretense of malice.

208
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,861
And I don't believe for one moment
that the writer of this letter

209
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,198
wishes to protect the interests
of Elinor Carlisle.

210
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,743
Unless, of course, Elinor Carlisle
wrote this herself.

211
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,371
That's a strange suggestion, Poirot.
I could see how upset she was.

212
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,623
Strange for you, maybe.

213
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,042
But once I found your strategy
of pawns most strange

214
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,587
and you almost put me in check.
- That was a long time ago.

215
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,300
To say the truth,
when you came here,

216
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,888
I thought this letter
would be a thing just trivial.

217
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,810
And yet, the care of its construction,
the words, even the design,

218
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,230
tell to me it is not the case.

219
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,233
Of course it may lead to nothing.

220
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:05,155
So, why? Why do I sense
that the outlook may be dark?

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,494
- Miss Carlisle.
- Mrs. Bishop.

222
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,456
Have you seen Mr. Winter?

223
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,210
No, but I don't think he's upstairs.
The garden, maybe?

224
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,838
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.

225
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:28,512
Aye, it's nice enough, Mary dear,
but I'm sure you can do better.

226
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,557
Yes, with your education
especially.

227
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,184
Now, let us see
what your aunt sent.

228
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,604
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I was looking for Mr. Winter.

229
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:41,775
- I haven't seen him. Have you, Mary?
- No, I've just come back from the post-office.

230
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,612
This is from my aunt Mary,
New Zealand, my mother's sister.

231
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,074
I was named after her, so she
always sends me things.

232
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,951
That is kind.

233
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:55,539
Yes. She emigrated before I was born.
And now she's the only family I have left.

234
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,959
What a lovely thing.

235
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,255
Yes, it is. I am sorry
to interrupt you.

236
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,718
You show it to Mrs. Welman.

237
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,139
You know, she's been so kind to me.
Only today she was saying

238
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,976
she might help me in the future.
Just like she did with my schooling.

239
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,820
Well, I guess I'll se on aunt Laura
before I go to bed.

240
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:31,825
Of course. I'll wait in here and then
I can always come and tuck you in.

241
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,622
Perhaps not tonight. Ms. Bishop may be
doing her rounds. There's time enough.

242
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,541
All right. I'll let you rest tonight.

243
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,712
So... How did you like
meeting Mary again?

244
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,758
What? Oh yes! She's...
she's a sweet girl.

245
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,727
<i>Nighty night.</i>

246
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,217
What were you doing?

247
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,971
Elinor... I was just
making her more comfortable.

248
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,981
Yes, of course. Good night.

249
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,401
Good night.

250
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,335
Elinor Carlisle,
this is Hercule Poirot.

251
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,963
<i>- Monsieur Poirot.
- Mademoiselle Carlisle.</i>

252
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,965
This is my fiancé, Mr. Winter.

253
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,717
<i>- Monsieur Winter...
- How do you do?</i>

254
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,219
- We are so grateful for you to come.
- Oh please, not at all.

255
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,430
It is most kind of you to invite me.

256
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,516
We are honoured. The Cartwright trial
has been most exciting.

257
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:23,520
Indeed, for me <i>hélas!</i>, it is like eating
the same meal three times a day.

258
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,485
Monsieur Poirot,
this is Mary Gerrard.

259
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,323
Whose late father looked after the garden
here. She has just returned from Europe.

260
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,116
<i>Mademoiselle Gerrard.</i>

261
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,118
I'm very glad to meet you,
Monsieur Poirot.

262
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,581
Oh, I'll take a salmon, thank you.

263
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,083
Mademoiselle Gerrard, may I
ask you where in Europe?

264
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,003
Germany. I was staying with a family
near Freiburg.

265
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,340
Ah, the Black Forrest...
It's a beautiful country.

266
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,801
Do you know, I think the nacional-socialists
are doing a good job over there.

267
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,930
I sometimes wish we had
politicians like that here.

268
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,516
I think, <i>monsieur,</i> that
you are most fortunate you do not.

269
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,392
Do you?

270
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,395
It's much to pleasant an occasion
for european politics.

271
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,898
- May I have a word, Roddy?
- Excuse me.

272
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,531
So, Monsieur Poirot,

273
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,242
do you think my letter is important?

274
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,161
I can not yet
give to you an answer.

275
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,749
But to me, everything is important
until it proves otherwise,

276
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,002
even the strategies of chess
of my friend Dr. Lord.

277
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:33,048
- Does he ever win?
- <i>Non</i>, but one time he came quite close.

278
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:37,094
<i>Non non,</i> he has a mind
truly wonderful for the game.

279
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,518
That is my aunt, Monsieur Poirot.

280
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,020
She's too ill
to join us, I'm affraid.

281
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,736
I realize its much too soon to say
who may have written the letter.

282
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,865
But I know Dr. Lord
has told you about our household.

283
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,410
So, do you have any suspicions
about whom it refers to?

284
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,620
The intruder?

285
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,875
There's no need for me to suspect.
The writer has made it quite obvious.

286
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,626
How?

287
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,088
<i>Alors  the phrase " white as snow"
is most odd, yes?</i>

288
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:18,510
But certainly it is used deliberately.
So, tell to me. mademoiselle, who was it

289
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,847
who was it that had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow?

290
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,474
Mary.

291
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,517
<i>Oui.</i>

292
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,578
Mrs. Welman, are you all right?

293
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,164
Oh dear, you're not yourself.

294
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:52,628
Stay calm. You've had another turn.
I'll call the doctor.

295
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,506
Please, Lewis...

296
00:20:56,131 --> 00:21:01,261
I need to see
the photograph of Lewis.

297
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,347
Not this again...

298
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,690
Please, I can't open your private things.
I must get the doctor.

299
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,510
Mrs. Welman, you're ill.
I must send for the doctor now, I must!

300
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,068
It's all right, it's all right, get calm.

301
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:02,364
Don't excite yourself.
You want somebody to come?

302
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,329
Your lawyer? You want
your lawyer to come?

303
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,462
Provision? You want to change
something in your will?

304
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,593
Related to Mary?
Mary Gerrard?

305
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,095
I'll call the lawyers.
Seddon shall be here directly.

306
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,683
- Please don't worry about it.
- Rest now, It will be done.

307
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,650
May I go in?

308
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,570
Yes, of course.
The doctor's in there.

309
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,329
I see... Yes...

310
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,625
Well, thank you. I'll meet him
here tomorrow. Goodbye.

311
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,547
Seddon can't be here until tomorrow.
Is that all right?

312
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:05,135
Yes, yes I think so. She's had another stroke,
But I'm sure she has a little time yet.

313
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,680
I've seen some improvements
since last night.

314
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,856
Have you lost something, dear?

315
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,610
It's that sarcoma in the village
Eliza Rykin.

316
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,655
I was sure I had
put her tube of morphine here

317
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,658
for tomorrow.
But somehow it's gone.

318
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,411
The only place where I've put my bag
down was out there, in the corredor.

319
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,916
Oh, why don't you look again, dear?
Nobody here would take it.

320
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,545
No, it's gone.

321
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,550
Now that your work is done,
I thought you'd be singing, Poirot.

322
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,426
I am content to return to London,
<i>mon ami,</i>

323
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,763
but I do not like
the unfinished business.

324
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,057
- The letter!
- <i>Oui</i>

325
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,686
Well, perhaps you wanted it
to be more than it was.

326
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:01,358
I promise you, they have
other things to think about now.

327
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,110
- Yes?
- Ordinary things.

328
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,446
Ah! Even so, I return this letter
with reluctance

329
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,532
and only because it is not
my property.

330
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,869
Ask them to keep it safe,
if you please.

331
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,248
- And keep me informed of any developments.
- Oh, I'm sure there'll be none.

332
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,168
- Of course.
- <i>Bon.</i>

333
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,434
There's no sense in hanging on to it.
Even your detective didn't get anywhere.

334
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,353
But, Roddy he asked us to keep it safe.

335
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,647
Well, no doubt to cover his own failure.

336
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,569
He's gone now and we have
more important things to think about.

337
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,866
Thank God the doctor said
she would make out of this.

338
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,245
Shouldn't be too bloomy,
she wouldn't want that.

339
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,208
No. It's just seeing her like this...

340
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,421
I'm so tired, Roddy.
I think I'll go to bed early.

341
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,715
What're you going to do?

342
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,218
I'll let you sleep.
You look worn-in.

343
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,720
I'll just play some billiard
or sometin' before I go up.

344
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,197
Elinor, nurse Hopkins
is happy to stay tonight

345
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,200
and take for nurse O'Brien.
But she woud like a word.

346
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:36,328
Oh, thank you, Mary.
Are you off home now, or...

347
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,208
- I'd really like to stay.
- Of course, if you want to stay close by

348
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,710
you could use the room at the end.

349
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,796
- My aunt would like that.
- Thank you.

350
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,132
Good night.

351
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,858
But I don't... I don't know...

352
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,795
Miss Carlisle!

353
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:14,218
Miss Carlisle,
Mrs. Welman's been taken very bad.

354
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,679
The doctor was called.
You must come at once.

355
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,725
I'm coming.

356
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,836
I'm very sorry.

357
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,046
Would it have been painful?

358
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,257
No, no absolutely not.

359
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,511
Sometimes you have a sudden relapse
like that. It's very quick.

360
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,347
And in it's way is a mercy.

361
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,267
You must tak any consolation
any consolation you can from that.

362
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,285
I'm so sorry, Elinor.

363
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,707
But thank God for it, I say,

364
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,669
I couldn't have borne seeing her
lingering in the state she was tonight.

365
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,172
You... saw her tonight?

366
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,011
What? Oh, yes...
I left the cards and looked in briefly

367
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,139
while the nurse was getting tea.

368
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:50,689
She was lying there, breathing so hard.
I hated seeing her like that.

369
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,819
It's probably why
I've felt so strange all evening.

370
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,031
I know I wasn't really myself.

371
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,075
No?

372
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:13,754
You should go to bed. I won't
come in and disturb you. Not tonight.

373
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,261
Good night, Roddy.

374
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,189
- I'll have the "Times", if you please.
- Certainly, sir.

375
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,443
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

376
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,698
The British Library,
if you please.

377
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,048
"Laura Welman died suddenly
at her hone in Hunterbury House

378
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,968
" on September 16th 1937.
Funeral Hunterbury church

379
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,470
" September 21. 'The nobel strain
a noble day doth make'."

380
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,056
... <i>dust to dust.</i>

381
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:11,728
<i>In the sure and certain hope of
the ressurrection to eternal life. Amen.</i>

382
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,493
You came back just because of this?

383
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:33,083
It was quite sudden. I was wrongly
optimistic in my diagnose.

384
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,420
Sometimes they change
quickly.

385
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,673
She had another stroke
that affected her very badly.

386
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,593
So - you see,
the letter, it was correct.

387
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,970
It said that she would die
after another stroke.

388
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,724
Yes, that's true, but given the severity
of the first stroke, it wasn't remarkable.

389
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,768
Poirot, I think you may be
overreacting.

390
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,103
There was no murder.

391
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:57,774
Please be honest with me. In your profession
as a doctor, this is your true opinion?

392
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:01,778
Yes, it is. And I have to ask you
to honour it as a friend.

393
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,156
So you give to me no choice?

394
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,075
- I don't want to see people upset.
- <i>Bon.</i>

395
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,246
- When will you go back?
- I'm not going back.

396
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,041
I intend to stay a little.

397
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,796
And perhaps we can play some chess...

398
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,141
Well, now! We're nearly all down here.
What a terrible shame they didn't offer

399
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,186
the village a cup of tea.
It's not the same without it.

400
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,482
Maybe, but Miss Carlisle
didn't look no good at all.

401
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,734
I doubt that she had the strenght.

402
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,153
Strenght enough
to hear the will, though.

403
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,573
The lawyer is down there with her, now.
And Mrs. Welman would've made sure

404
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,827
there was refreshment after
a funeral. Hear my words.

405
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,663
Oh, I meant to ask you, dear.

406
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,666
Did you find that tube
of morfine when you went home?

407
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:00,170
No, I did not. I don't understand it.

408
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,009
But there were some papers and things
I threw out, it may have been there.

409
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,347
That must have been it. I wouldn't worry
about it anymore if I were you, dear.

410
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:16,186
Well, time to say goodbye.

411
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:25,070
Again, I'm very sorry for what happened,
Miss Carlisle, Mr. Winter.

412
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,407
I can't degree the pity she didn't
summon me earlier.

413
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,995
Mr. Seddon, it's perfectly obvious
she wanted to alter her will.

414
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:38,709
It's clear to everyone. She mentioned
Mary and she wanted to change it.

415
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:43,130
Miss Carlisle, I can assure you of one thing.
You're wrong in that assumption.

416
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:48,844
There could be no change as such,
you see, your aunt made no will.

417
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,638
- What?
- But that's extraordinary!

418
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,892
Not as extraordinary as
you might think, Mr. Winter.

419
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,186
People are often supersticious.
They think if they make

420
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:00,647
a will, they die.
So they put it off.

421
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,399
Didn't you reason with her?

422
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,902
Frequently. But she
said all the usual things,

423
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:10,407
that she didn't intend to die just yet.
It's just human nature, I'm affraid.

424
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:16,580
People go on avoiding a thing
in her personal life which is distasteful.

425
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,334
So, the upshot is very simple.

426
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,670
Since your aunt died
with no bequests,

427
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:29,176
no will, no settlements or trusts,
everything, including this house,

428
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:33,055
goes to her next of kin,
which, of course, is you,

429
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,557
her niece, Elinor Carlisle.

430
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,100
Everything?

431
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:41,688
Well, apart from her death duties,
the state will still be substantial.

432
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,859
No, Elinor, you should have it all.

433
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,278
I don't want you to think otherwise.
It's your right.

434
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,281
But Roddy, we said it didn't matter
who was left the money,

435
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,492
since we were to be married.
Remember?

436
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,160
Yes.

437
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,871
But... are we?

438
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:01,124
I thought that was the idea,
of course if you have other plans, now...

439
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,628
Roddy, can't you be honest?

440
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,839
Sorry, I don't know
what's happened to me.

441
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:11,134
I do. It's Mary, isn't it?

442
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,640
I saw you.

443
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,185
God, I...

444
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,980
Something happened
when I arrived here,

445
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,149
when we were at the garden,
I don't know what.

446
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,321
Isn't id obvious? Every time you
look at her, I see it in your face.

447
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:36,034
I didn't want to feel like this.
I was quite happy.

448
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,788
This upset all decent,
reasonable things.

449
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,333
Love isn't reasonable.

450
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,632
You better take this back, Roddy.

451
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,685
Will she marry you?

452
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,647
I don't know.

453
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:14,615
Well, give it time.
Take the fortnight in France.

454
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:19,828
Clear your head. If you still
feel the same after you're back,

455
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,622
then that's the time to pursue it.

456
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,502
I didn't deserve you.
Even as a friend.

457
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,968
Sometimes, it's all like a dream.

458
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,763
As if I may wake up
and see that she isn't there.

459
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,223
But she is there!

460
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,280
Damn you, Mary!

461
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,251
Ah! Mary... Sit down, please.

462
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,504
Thank you.

463
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:16,343
So, what are your plans now?
Do you intend to go away?

464
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,680
Not directly. I still have
to clear out my parents' things

465
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,391
from the lodge house.
That'll take me a few days.

466
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,394
I've been putting it off
ever since I got back.

467
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:30,732
As you know, Mary, my aunt
always took a great interest in you.

468
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,652
Yes, she was very kind.

469
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,031
You'd be aware that she made no will.

470
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:44,079
I have thought about that a good deal
and it seemed to me that, if she had lived,

471
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,124
she would have wanted to make
several legacies.

472
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,544
Of course I've made provision
to the servants.

473
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,046
But you don't quite come
into that class.

474
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:57,634
I am sure she would have wanted
to make some contribution for your future,

475
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:00,971
therefore, I'm arranging, as soon as
the probation is granted,

476
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,808
to advance you 7000 pounds,

477
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:10,063
that sum to be yours, to do
absolutely as you please.

478
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:14,234
Thank you.

479
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,574
It was quite a surprise
that she left no will.

480
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,451
But then, many people don't...

481
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,536
Yes, I only made one myself this year.

482
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,205
A will?

483
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,832
Nurse O'Brien thinks
everyone should.

484
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,127
I have my aunt in New Zealand.
So I named her.

485
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,423
You've been so kind.

486
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:40,260
It was my aunt's wish.
Or that's what I think.

487
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,725
Thank you.

488
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,780
<i>- Bonjour, Mademoiselle Gerrard.</i>
- Hello.

489
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,031
You're in a hurry?

490
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,451
I just had some good news,
now, I'm on my way to meet someone.

491
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,453
I'm very pleased for you, Mlle.

492
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,875
Mademoiselle, is it your intention
to remain in the village?

493
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,586
I'm staying here for now.

494
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:20,092
Yes, yes of course.
<i>Pardon.</i> I will not detain you further.

495
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,848
Mademoiselle, please be careful,
as you go.

496
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,184
Of course.

497
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:45,659
That's a great piece of luck for you, Mary.
It was good of Miss Carlisle to do the right thing.

498
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:50,998
She didn't... Well, she didn't look
very pleased about it.

499
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:55,043
Hardly surprising, after what happened
between you and Mr. Winter, is it, dear?

500
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,754
That's hardly our business.

501
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:01,508
Sorry dear, but all
village must be talking about it.

502
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,221
I didn't lead him on.

503
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,224
But has you made you an offer?

504
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,438
The truth is... he's indicated.

505
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,691
There you are, now.
Isn't that romantic?

506
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,694
Excuse me.

507
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:28,911
I do hope it's alright.
You wonder if he won't hurt her in the end?

508
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:33,540
I know. And that family in the house
hasn't always been lucky in love.

509
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:49,264
Mademoiselle Carlisle,
do you permit that I join you?

510
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,475
Yes, of course.

511
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,936
I wish to speak to you
of your anonymous letter.

512
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:56,271
I do not yet know who wrote it.

513
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,857
- Oh! The letter...
- <i>Oui.</i>

514
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,985
So much has happened
I'd quite forgotten.

515
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:07,324
I'm affraid, Mr. Poirot,
the letter is destroyed.

516
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:12,079
It doesn't matter who sent it now.
We'll never know anyway.

517
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:17,209
Mlle. Carlisle, it is no matter if the letter
is destroyed. It is in here.

518
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,505
And I said I did not yet know.
I did not say never.

519
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,467
Please, extend me the cortesy of
having some confidence in my skills.

520
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,304
I'm sorry, Monsieur Poirot.

521
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,766
The truth is I'm a little distracted.

522
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,103
I'm sure you've heard that
my engagement has ended.

523
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,188
I'm sure all village is talking about it.

524
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,400
Yes, I was very sorry to hear it.

525
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:46,321
If you permit, mademoiselle,
I extend to you my utmost simpathy.

526
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:53,287
I can understand the ache of the heart.
It is a place very lonely.

527
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,666
Thank you.

528
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,382
It is certainly hard when
the accident of another person's return,

529
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:13,307
another person's beauty,
suddenly destroys your life.

530
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:20,606
<i>D'accord.</i> But then a man
who is swayed by such things

531
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:24,151
is not likely to be constant,
is that not so?

532
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:30,324
No, that is not so. It's only her.
Nobody else could've changed him, nobody!

533
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:35,913
Mary has destroyed everything,
and I can't help it, but I just wish...

534
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,374
I wish so much...

535
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,003
... that she was dead.

536
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,892
Come on, Poirot. Drink it.

537
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:02,105
You see, it troubles you also, my dear
doctor. That the glass that is poured

538
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:05,859
it is perfect in every way
and yet I choose not to drink it.

539
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:08,153
I wait. And this troubles you.

540
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,531
What are you thinking?

541
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:16,703
About action that is uncompleted.
Action that is suspended,

542
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:22,000
like this:
pouring without drinking.

543
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:26,421
And yet, surely, once it is poured,
it will be drunk. But <i>non...</i>

544
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:36,723
And it is the same here.
For crime it can be like this, also.

545
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,645
You questioned me for
staying here.

546
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:45,691
But sometimes, as in
the case of your letter, I see a pattern.

547
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,487
I see a color.

548
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:57,369
I sense in my heart
the inevitability

549
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,916
and yet, what can I, Poirot, do?

550
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,711
Nothing.

551
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,716
For the glass, it's
on the table, waiting.

552
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,678
Waiting for someone to drink.

553
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,351
Me?

554
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:25,105
The cook and the maids
have taken a week, as you asked them,

555
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:27,399
but I don't require time off.

556
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,819
And you shouldn't be alone
in the house. It's not right.

557
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:35,741
Mrs. Bishop, I just want to go quietly
through my aunt's things.

558
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:39,620
I don't need anyone, you see.
I'm almost certainly going to sell.

559
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,957
The other servants wondered
if that would be the case.

560
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,877
- Naturally, we had hoped...
- Yes...

561
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,087
I had hoped, too.

562
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:58,263
Miss Carlisle, what can I do for you?

563
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,349
I wanted some sandwich paste, Mr. Turner.

564
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,894
Of course. Now, what would you like?

565
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:07,731
Salmon, crab and shrimp,
ham and tongue?

566
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,902
You know, in spite of the names,
I always think their taste is rather alike.

567
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:15,906
Hmm, in a way... But, of course,
they're tasty. Very tasty.

568
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:20,160
I want the salmon,
and crab and shrimp.

569
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:25,791
People used to be rather affraid
of eating fish paste, didn't they?

570
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,127
Well, there have been cases
of ptomaine poisoning.

571
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,090
I can assure you, Miss Carlisle,
this is an excellent brand.

572
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,259
I've never had a single complaint.

573
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:39,137
Of course, I didn't mean
anything. Thank you.

574
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,195
We best hurry, Mary.

575
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,614
Miss Carlisle is expecting us
for lunch.

576
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,200
<i>All right.
That's last of the living room here.</i>

577
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,537
What a tangle...

578
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:06,748
Have you come across
any old gardiner gloves?

579
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,041
<i>Hold on.</i>

580
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:07,851
Hello?

581
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:19,112
Sorry. Did I give you a fright?
I was just getting my other appron.

582
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,031
Of course.

583
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,408
I'm making sandwiches.

584
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:29,039
I saw Mr. Winter in the village.
Is he back again so soon?

585
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:33,836
What? No, Roddy is not here.
He's still abroad.

586
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:39,383
Well, it certainly looked like him.
Maybe I'm wrong.

587
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,969
Yes...

588
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,278
I'm sorry' there seems to be
rather a lot of flies around.

589
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:06,660
The salmon is for you, Mary.
It's the nearest.

590
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,871
Thank you.

591
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:27,097
Oh, I'm sorry. The others
are crab and shrimp.

592
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:29,183
Thank you.

593
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,021
I meant to get some coffe,
but I quite forgot in the end.

594
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:35,856
Well, if there's tea, I can make some.

595
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,609
Oh, yes. Not for me, but... please.

596
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:53,207
♪ Polly put the kettle on ♪

597
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,461
Remember we used to sing that
when we were children?

598
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,213
Yes, I do.

599
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,257
It is a pitty, isn't it?

600
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,177
We can never go back.

601
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,197
<i>Here we are.</i>

602
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,496
It's nice and strong.

603
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,333
- Here we are, Mary.
- Thank you.

604
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,337
This was very thoughtful
of you, Miss Carlisle.

605
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:45,425
It's a nuisance having to break off
and go into the village for lunch.

606
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,684
Are you all right, Mary?

607
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:57,104
Just the sandwich was rather bitter.

608
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:00,023
I hope the paste was all right.

609
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:06,363
Mine is all right.
Will you have some more tea?

610
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,119
Are you sure you won't have
a cup, Miss Carlisle?

611
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,288
No, thank you.

612
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:17,958
Then I'll just go and
turn off the kettle.

613
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:21,920
I left in on, in case we wanted
to fill the pot up again.

614
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:30,262
Mary?

615
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:32,764
Yes?

616
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:37,978
Nothing.

617
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:52,576
I thought I saw a man, outside.
Is there someone here?

618
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,578
No. Only Ted.

619
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,998
It wasn't him.
It's quite hot in here.

620
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:00,501
Yes, the place heads south.

621
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:03,837
I tidied up the other plates.
Let me finish these.

622
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:05,714
Thank you. Did you hurt yourself?

623
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:11,970
No, it was the rose treaders.
It's quite a jungle there.

624
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,516
I might ask Ted
to help us.

625
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:21,772
Are you all right, Miss Carlisle?
You're not looking quite the thing.

626
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:27,277
Well, I-- I just want
all this clearing done.

627
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,531
I'll be up, when I'm finished
down here.

628
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,749
<i>So, it's Nellie and Ms. Markinson
for these.</i>

629
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:46,171
And that poor creature at Ivy Cottage
could have some of the night things.

630
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,299
This will be a godsend to them.

631
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:53,053
I think I'll take them there myself,
while Mary gets on with the lodge.

632
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:54,805
She's gone back there, has she?

633
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,641
Mary? No, I left her in the library.

634
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,603
But that was ages ago.
What's she been doing?

635
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:06,400
Mary?

636
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,986
Mary?

637
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,488
She's fallen asleep.

638
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,576
Come on, my girl.Wake up.

639
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,246
Mary?

640
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:29,965
I'll have to call
Dr. Lord this moment.

641
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,467
- What's the matter?
- The matter?

642
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:36,638
This girl is near death.
I think she's been poisoned.

643
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:18,347
You have heard?

644
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:21,558
That Elinor Carlisle
has been charged with murder? Yes.

645
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:29,608
- There's something I need to tell you.
- This way.

646
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:34,196
Ah, Poirot! Have a look at this.

647
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,241
We found it yesterday, just here,
where the sandwiches were made.

648
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:41,161
We can't find any more, but it's been
identified as part

649
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:45,457
of a label for morfine.
They shared the tea,

650
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,794
<i>so it must be
the sandwiches.</i>

651
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:52,256
Are you aware that a file of morphine
disappeared from this house?

652
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,007
What?

653
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:58,595
<i>Oui.</i>Dr. Lord here just told me
of it. It was in the bag of the nurse.

654
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,600
I'm sure the nurses
will confirm it.

655
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:09,231
So Miss Carlisle had the ample
oportunity to take it and use it.

656
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:16,947
<i>And her motive is clear. She was destroyed,
her fiancé had abandoned her for the deceased.</i>

657
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,534
Of course, there are
some difficulties.

658
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:24,538
Like the fact they all ate
the sandwiches.

659
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,875
It is scarcely a difficulty
if you read the statements.

660
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:33,213
Yes, they all ate the sandwiches. But
the poison, it only needed to be in one.

661
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:37,885
And the favorite of Mary Gerrard,
as Elinor Carlisle herself testifies,

662
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,763
it was the salmon.
- That's how it was done.

663
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,643
Then there's your anonymous letter,
that doesn't really fit.

664
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:51,356
Why not? Let us supose
that Elinor Carlisle was most anxious

665
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:54,818
about the return of Mary Gerrard,
for there is much talk of her beauty

666
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,739
and she knows that her fiancé and Mary
were close in the past.

667
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:01,658
And that they were bound
to meet together here.

668
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:04,828
So, Elinor Carlisle herself
writes the anonymous letter

669
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,997
hoping to turn him
against Mary.

670
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,834
She wishes him to think that

671
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,879
she's a girl... (what--?) out for
what she can get.

672
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:17,007
But that does not work, she loses him.

673
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,593
And so she is driven
to a crime far more desperate.

674
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,221
But how could she hope
to get away wih it?

675
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:25,766
My dear doctor, I am describing
a crime of passion!

676
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:30,437
Poirot, Poirot, how could you do that?
How could you build a case

677
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,856
against Elinor Carlisle?
She's not a murderer!

678
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,191
- How can you be so certain?
- You saw her qualities.

679
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:37,110
- And I also saw her pain.
- She's not capable of it.

680
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,029
On the contrary.
She's more than capable.

681
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:42,241
That man in there
has no idea of the woman.

682
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,617
My dear doctor,

683
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:48,288
do you suppose I was advancing the case
just to help him?

684
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:51,542
Given the facts that I see here,
any prosecuting counsel

685
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:56,296
any idiot of a magistrate would come
to the conclusions I have, just like that!

686
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:02,052
And I think that it is fair
to say that you are partial.

687
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,889
I don't deny it, but she didn't do this.

688
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:10,477
Please, I'm beging you,
help me find the truth.

689
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:14,773
My dear doctor,
you asked for my help,

690
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,735
but I do not not think
you have been completely honest with me.

691
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,906
I still have my suspicions
about the death of Laura Welman.

692
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,326
And I'm going to ask the Police
to exhume her body.

693
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:30,831
And so, I ask you again,
to tell me truthfully:

694
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,251
What will they find?

695
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,588
I don't know.

696
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,758
But possibly morphine...

697
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,386
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>
I do not understand you.

698
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:48,015
You told to me otherwise. You made me
hold back. As a friend, you said.

699
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:52,853
Poirot, please... I never dreamt
of such a thing.

700
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:56,356
I thought it was probably natural,

701
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,775
but there was another possibility.

702
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:02,738
I was aware that she might have
taken the drug herself.

703
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,532
- You see, she often talked of it.
- So you were playing the merciful doctor, uh?

704
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:09,703
As I said, she talked of it.
Under such circunstances,

705
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:13,040
I didn't wish to cause a scandal
by insisting on an autopsy.

706
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,210
However, I must insist that
you are now completely honest with me.

707
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:18,045
You did not giver her the drug
at her request?

708
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:19,296
I swear to you I didn't.

709
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,300
I told her myself I had no wish
to be hanged, I wouldn't do it.

710
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,720
Very well.

711
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:30,390
All the same, I wish you had told to me
you had those suspicions.

712
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:33,393
Because if you are right,
it can be worse now to Elinor Carlisle

713
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:35,979
than even I could have thought.

714
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,233
So, you do not wish to talk?

715
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:46,114
I made a statement.
I have nothing else to say.

716
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:48,408
Mademoiselle Carlisle,

717
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:53,330
you are aware of how your silence,
it will be constued?

718
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,668
It is no matter.

719
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:05,175
<i>It's such a shock, I can tell you.</i>

720
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,177
- Now, we'll have some tea.
<i>- Merci.</i>

721
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:13,433
Like I told the Police,
Monsieur Poirot,

722
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:18,355
Miss Carlisle was so strange,
very strange in her manner.

723
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:23,777
I'd thought it for days, but
that afternoon she was downright odd.

724
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:26,864
Talking as if didn't know
what she was saying

725
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:31,285
her eyes so bright and queer.

726
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:34,913
And you said that she looked guilty?

727
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,375
Oh, yes!She was trembling, before and afterwards.

728
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,879
It was as if she'd been caught out.

729
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:48,969
And those sandwiches that she made,
did they look the same?

730
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,805
They were not on different bread?

731
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:55,142
No. Definitely not, white bread,
looked very much the same.

732
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:59,104
But Mary had the salmon
and we had the crab.

733
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:04,526
When I think of how poor
Mary was when we found her...

734
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:10,657
She was one of the most
beautiful girls I ever saw, Mr. Poirot.

735
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:15,037
And not stuck-up,
as she could have been.

736
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:17,748
The old lady had taken
a tremendous fancy to her.

737
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,250
Suprising, perhaps?

738
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:25,589
Oh, that depends. Might be
quite natural in one way.

739
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:29,843
And surely does an elderly person
good to have a young face about.

740
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,514
I see.

741
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:36,767
And there's nothing else?

742
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:41,772
Nothing else at all, that
you can tell to me about Mary Gerrard?

743
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,694
I don't know of anything.

744
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,199
No, Mary was not poisoned
before she came here.

745
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,701
How could she have walked
from the lodge?

746
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:59,873
<i>Non...</i> Without doubt
she was poisoned in this room.

747
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:02,292
But she and nurse Hopkins
shared the tea, so...

748
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,711
It must have been in the sandwiches.

749
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,217
But Poirot, somebody could easily have
entered in here and tempered with them.

750
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:15,973
There was a figure in the garden, out there.
Perhaps somebody from Mary's past.

751
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:20,561
Or, what is more likely,
someone we know.

752
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,815
I made a statemen to the Policemen, Mr. Poirot.

753
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,734
I wasn't around this side of the house
at all, that day.

754
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:29,820
I was up, near the road.

755
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,157
- Did you see a figure?
- No...

756
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:41,498
But I d-- I did see a car. Hum, parked
on the road, early in the afternoon.

757
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,418
And did you recognise the car?

758
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:51,175
N-- no, I don't think so.
I think it was green.

759
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:57,556
I just can't  believe anyone
would do such a thing.

760
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:01,310
And certainly not Miss Carlisle.

761
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:06,523
Tell me, Monsieur Horlick,
you were fond of Mary, were you not?

762
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:09,860
Everyone knows that.

763
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,031
Wasn't the same,
when she came back from abroad.

764
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:17,451
But did she have any enemies?

765
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,536
Not that I know.

766
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:25,292
She was always a bit different,
but-- people liked her.

767
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:29,254
Then, after she came back,
nobody knew her so well.

768
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,632
Why is that?

769
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:36,136
She was just changed.
Not stuck-up exactly, just...

770
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:38,639
not one of us anymore.

771
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:33,694
This is for Mary.

772
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,533
"But she is in her grave.
And ! the difference to me."

773
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:44,121
Wordsworth. I read him much.

774
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:48,709
This poem expresses perhaps
what you feel?

775
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:54,047
Yes, expresses widely now
what I feel. If you'd to bring it up.

776
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,550
<i>Pardon.</i> Please do forgive me,
Monsieur Winter.

777
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,719
There are certain things
one should not say,

778
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:01,013
but, nevetheless,
a detective is forced to say.

779
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,932
Or to ask about
the feelings of people.

780
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,812
Well, if it helps Elinor, Poirot,
ask what you want.

781
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,982
<i>Merci.</i>

782
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,987
You returned home early
from France, I believe?

783
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,324
You were seen here
on the day of the murder.

784
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:25,204
Yes, all right, I did come back,
but I didn't want Elinor to know.

785
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:28,248
You see, I decided
to ask Mary to marry me.

786
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:32,294
- And you saw her?
- No, I didn't.

787
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,256
You see, she wasn't expecting me,
so I decided to wait.

788
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,801
Certainly wasn't goin' to
barge into Hunterbury.

789
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:43,263
I waited here,
close to Mary's lodgings.

790
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,767
And, of course, Mary
she never came.

791
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,186
I saw an ambulance,
Police cars.

792
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,273
People were talking
and I've heard what they said.

793
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,859
Couldn't face anyone,

794
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:58,987
so I took a train back into town
and waited for news.

795
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:01,615
Then I learned she was dead.
I felt like--

796
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,867
And you do not think Elinor did this?

797
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:08,372
No, of course not. The fact
they dragged Elinor into this

798
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,374
makes it even more tragic.

799
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,334
So, if she escapes the gaolers,

800
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,419
you will reconsider your engagement?

801
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:16,296
What do you think I am?

802
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:20,133
Of course not!
It is ended.

803
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:25,055
But I want her to be alright.
She's a very decent person.

804
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:27,975
- Better than...
- ... than you?

805
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:30,811
Is that what you you were going to say?

806
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:46,118
No doubt at all, Poirot.

807
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,163
Several ounces of morphine
were found in her body.

808
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:52,666
It was administered
on the day she died.

809
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:01,967
You're very kind, Mr. Poirot.

810
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:05,304
I am happy to answer your questions.

811
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,266
Of course I heard about
Mrs. Welman. What a terrible thing, too.

812
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:12,269
And you had no suspicions at that time?

813
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,271
Not the least in the world.

814
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:21,111
So, tell to me, if you please.
Did anyone else enter the room

815
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:24,239
of Madame Welman that night,
other than Mademoiselle Carlisle?

816
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:28,243
I never left her side. Except
when Miss Carlisle came in.

817
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,371
Well, she was so bold and clever,
that one.

818
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,791
So why would she have wanted
to do it?

819
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:40,881
For the money, that's why!
She knew quite well if she didn't do it,

820
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:44,092
every penny would go to Mary Gerrard.
And that's the truth.

821
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:49,807
So Mary Gerrard was a girl
who was scheming and clever?

822
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,102
No! Oh, that's a terrible thing to say.

823
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:58,398
Mrs. Welman adored her.
She was a very sweet girl.

824
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:01,819
But not one of us.

825
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,530
<i>Pardon...</i>

826
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:08,408
She was an only child?

827
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:13,831
Is it possible pehaps that
she had been adopted?

828
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:15,791
What?

829
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:21,505
No, certainly not.
I must say, this is a lovely cake.

830
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,845
She made a will, is that correct?

831
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,265
Awful, awful to think of it now.
Nurse Hopkins and I

832
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:34,017
advised her it was a good thing to do.

833
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:37,062
We thought she should,
since she had expectations.

834
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,022
But I wish we'd never
mentioned it now, I do.

835
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:42,192
So the 7000 pounds goes to her aunt.
She has no family here?

836
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,862
Just her mother's sister
nursing at New Zeland.

837
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:48,448
I've written to the old lady.
What a terrible shock it will be, too.

838
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,451
So will Miss Carlisle be hanged?

839
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,376
If she is found guilty.

840
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:13,557
"Mrs. Welman, whose money
went to Elinor Carlisle,

841
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,642
"was murdered by morphine.

842
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,228
Mary Gerrard,

843
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:23,066
who came between
Elinor Carlisle and her fiancé,

844
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:26,278
was murdered by morphine.

845
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:31,283
And nobody in the world had the
slightest motive to commit these murders,

846
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:33,076
other than the acused.

847
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:37,956
No one had the slightest opportunity,
other than the accused.

848
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:43,253
And this vengeful woman.

849
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:48,509
who openly whished her victim
dead to more than one witness,

850
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:54,097
never expressed
the slightest remorse...

851
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,152
Gentlemen of the jury,
what is your verdict?

852
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:14,660
<b>Guilty.</b>

853
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:33,804
<b>Elinor Carlisle,
you're sentenced to be taken hence</b>

854
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:40,727
<b>to the prison in which you were last confined
and from there to a place of execution</b>

855
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:46,066
<b>where you'll be hanged
from the neck until dead.</b>

856
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:50,404
<b>And may the Lord have mercy
upon your soul.</b>

857
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,335
<i>Monsieur Poirot...</i>

858
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:11,091
<i>Mademoiselle,
please be careful as you go.</i>

859
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,011
<i>Of course...</i>

860
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:41,205
"Appeal Denied
Hanging in five Days"

861
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:44,041
I will admit that I've not
been sleeping very well,

862
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,044
but last night
finally I sleep.

863
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:51,965
And I dream...

864
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:59,890
I dream... I dream of the victim,
as she was at first.

865
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,559
On the street, outside of my hotel.

866
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:05,312
A girl so lovely,
the favorite of Madame Welman.

867
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:07,898
A girl who is liked by everyone,
and yet she's still a mystery.

868
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:19,576
And then-- then I wake up
and I recalled something.

869
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:20,828
<i>What?</i>

870
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:30,754
Uh... it is detail, in fact it is half a detail,
one twentieth of a detail,

871
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,006
but yes, my friend,
it worries me.

872
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,634
Something nurse Hopkins
said concerning Mary.

873
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:36,760
What about her?

874
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,430
Yes. What about her?
What is behind her?

875
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:43,559
- You are not making sense.
- Then suddenly I see there's something

876
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:46,270
that the good nurse Hopkins
she does not wish me to know.

877
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,938
Something she thinks
has no baring on the crime,

878
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:49,523
but I believe that it may.

879
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:51,024
But surely she would realize that.

880
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:54,653
<i>Non.<i> My dear doctor, nurse Hopkins
is a woman of high inteligence,</i></i>

881
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:55,654
within her limitations.

882
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:58,448
But her intelect is hardly equal
with that of mine.

883
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,285
She might not see it,
but Hercule Poirot, he would.

884
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,413
And suddenly, that raises in my mind
so many questions.

885
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:10,252
No, I was right before.
Something here is crooked.

886
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:15,966
But, doctor, time is short. There is
something I need from you, it is a book,

887
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:21,221
how does it call itself, a book which describes
the various medicines you prescribe?

888
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:24,308
- A formulary?
- <i>Oui, c'est ça!</i>I must borrow it.

889
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,815
<i>Merci.</i>

890
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:54,046
When I visited you before,
I said it was surprising

891
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:57,674
how Madame Welman
favored  Mary Gerrard

892
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:01,011
you said
it was only natural.

893
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,515
And I thought that you merely talking
about the friendship, that it was natural.

894
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:09,061
And then, I think again of  Mary
and I hear that word again " natural"

895
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:14,191
and I see that
you used it deliberatly.

896
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:19,279
Oh, I know it.
And now you must tell to me why.

897
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:30,123
Nurse O'Brien and I
had both heard crying out

898
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:32,835
about something in her past.

899
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,297
There was a man called Lewis.

900
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:43,053
But we both knew
there was much more to it than that.

901
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:50,269
And then I found this in the lodge,
after Mary had died.

902
01:11:55,232 --> 01:11:57,317
It is Madame Welman?

903
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,915
And the baby?

904
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:14,835
It's Mary Gerrard.

905
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:26,930
So Mary was the illegitimate daughter
of Madame Welman...

906
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,561
It's a sad story,
as you'll see from the letter.

907
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:36,857
The man couldn't marry her,
he had his own family.

908
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,819
Sometime later,
he was killed in the western front.

909
01:12:43,614 --> 01:12:47,159
The Gerrards had no children.
Mrs. Welman went to Scotland

910
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:50,829
and took Mrs. Gerrard with her,
where the baby was born.

911
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,957
Naturally she payed
for Mary schooling

912
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,668
and told them she would
provide for her.

913
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:01,882
But she couldn't admit the truth.
She had to avoid the scandal.

914
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:06,553
But, at last, Mary becomes clearer.

915
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:11,600
But what sadness.

916
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:20,526
"So, dear Mary, for all theses years
I had to keep this secret

917
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:25,447
"from the girl I brought up,
and such a hardship that has been."

918
01:13:26,073 --> 01:13:29,076
Of course, we had suspected this much.

919
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:31,912
Nurse intimated she knew, but...

920
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:37,543
What's the point of it coming out now?

921
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,587
I was going to destroy this.

922
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:46,176
As I said before, Mr. Poirot,
let the dead rest in peace.

923
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:51,306
<i>Non.</i> Not when one
has to consider the living.

924
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,728
Mademoiselle Carlisle,
you would say nothing before.

925
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,648
But now I know a little more.

926
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,108
I want to help you
and I believe I can.

927
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:05,362
But you must answer some questions
about that day, I beg of you.

928
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:11,326
- Why? Is there any p--
- --purpose? Yes, of course there's a purpose.

929
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:15,622
Please.

930
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,251
Now, just tell it to me,
from the very beginning.

931
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:21,628
Firstly, why did you give
time off to the servants?

932
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:27,176
I was upset.
I wanted to be alone.

933
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:31,763
And, when you made the sandwiches,
did you see anyone outside?

934
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:33,724
No.

935
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:39,396
Right. Then you went to sort through
some things of your aunt.

936
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,733
Did you discover anything
that afected you.

937
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:45,235
Any private matters
concearning your aunt?

938
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,738
What? No.

939
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:55,746
Well, then, you took Mary
and nurse Hopkins into the library

940
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,623
where you gave them the sandwiches.

941
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,836
What was Mary doing
when you left her?

942
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:09,593
She was on the sofa.
She seemed normal.

943
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:14,640
Now, each detail,
if you please.

944
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:25,776
I went down to the pantry.
Nurse was there doing the washing up.

945
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:31,907
She said she'd seen a man
in the garden, I didn't see anything.

946
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:34,618
What then did you you talk of?

947
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:37,454
I don't know.

948
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:43,919
Oh yes, the rose treaders
by the lodge.

949
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:49,216
She had a mark in her arm,
where the thorn had scratched her.

950
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,720
And then it all came back to me.

951
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:56,140
When we were children,

952
01:15:56,223 --> 01:16:02,062
Roddy and I, we kept having this quarrel
about the War of the Roses.

953
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:04,773
He liked the white roses

954
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:09,444
I said they weren't real,
because they didn't even smell.

955
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:15,200
I preferred red, because
they were big and dark

956
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:18,745
and smelled... like Summer.

957
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:23,834
Then I realized something,
yes, I did...

958
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:31,800
There was no reason to kill Mary, because
Roddy would never have stayed with me.

959
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:37,097
When I went...

960
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:43,854
When you went back,
Mary was dying.

961
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:49,610
You might as well ask me then:
did I intend to kill Mary Gerrard.

962
01:16:50,235 --> 01:16:54,281
<i>Non, non, Mademoiselle.</i>
Now, please do forgive me.

963
01:16:55,949 --> 01:17:00,037
I have very little time.
You told me all that I need.

964
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:04,625
And there are some things
I still do not wish to know.

965
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,195
Monsieur Horlick,
enter if you please.

966
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:36,740
Mr. Poirot, I'm sorry. There's
something I need to say in private.

967
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:41,954
Sr. Horlick, you see before you a miserable
animal, who has been a triple imbecil.

968
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:44,248
- I am 36 times an idiot.
- Sir?

969
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:48,752
Forgive me, I have discovered something
in a way that is most painful.

970
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:51,630
Hideously painful,
but very important.

971
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:55,592
<i>Pardon. Ca suffit.</i>
No matter. Please, do seat.

972
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,682
Tell to me what you wish to say.

973
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:03,767
It concearns Dr. Lord, sir.

974
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,770
If you do not agree,
I will go higher.

975
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:09,898
I wish you to take this matter
with the utmost seriousness.

976
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:14,278
- I'll do what I can, sir.
- It will have to be tomorrow.

977
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:16,989
Very well.

978
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:26,373
Poirot, you realize we have
less than a day and a night?

979
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:27,416
Why did you ask me here?

980
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,963
Because I wanted to show you this.

981
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:39,303
- The Zéphrine Rose.
- So?

982
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,224
Isn't that Mr. Winter?

983
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,310
What's going on?
What did Elinor say?

984
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:51,732
I will tell it to you. She told me
of a quarrel a long time ago.

985
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,777
And how she and Monsieur Winter
were in different sides.

986
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:59,990
And it made it very clear to me how she fell in love
a long time ago

987
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,617
with a man
who could not return her feeling.

988
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:07,331
And so, doctor, I began  to see through
all the lies that have been told to me.

989
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:08,790
Who has lied to you?

990
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:11,001
Everyone.

991
01:19:12,044 --> 01:19:13,504
Particularly you.

992
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,466
But, at last, the matter
it is almost concluded,

993
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:22,888
for I've made a trap.
Shall we go back to the house?

994
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,645
I had a message from the Inspector, Poirot.
Can you tell me what's this all about?

995
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:32,689
It strikes as very unpleasant.
I never wanted to see this room again.

996
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:35,317
- I am not surprised.
- What does that mean?

997
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,402
Gentlemen, please.

998
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,325
I have concluded that nothing
in this matter is what it seems.

999
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:48,622
Firstly, we have heard
that, on the day on the murder

1000
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:53,460
it was seen in the garden, a man very tall
and resembled to you, Monsieur Winter.

1001
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:54,795
I told you I never came here.

1002
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:58,340
So, would you be surprised to learn
of the will of Mademoiselle Carlisle.

1003
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:01,677
I established last night
that it is everything to you.

1004
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,222
I swear I had no idea.

1005
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:09,059
So, perhaps you stood outside
and observed her making the sandwiches

1006
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:11,061
and thought that they were for her.

1007
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:15,649
<i>Alors,</i> had she died,
you'd be a man very rich.

1008
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:19,194
This is outrageous!
I told I never came into the grounds.

1009
01:20:19,403 --> 01:20:24,616
However, if she was hanged,
you would be equally rich.

1010
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:31,832
So, let us assume,
as did the trial,

1011
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:34,293
that the murder, it was successful.

1012
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:39,423
It is easy to imagine, you or another,
being aware

1013
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:43,260
that Elinor Carlisle intended
to invite Mary Gerrard here

1014
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:46,513
and also to know that the preference of Mary
was for the salmon paste.

1015
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,515
Both these things,
they were well known.

1016
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:52,019
- Oh, you're including me?
- I include everyone.

1017
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:55,063
Now this person
has the file of morphine.

1018
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:56,940
And the chance it comes...

1019
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,111
And this is what he finds.

1020
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:07,284
The sandwiches.

1021
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:14,541
One of salmon paste,
the other two of shrimp and crab.

1022
01:21:16,335 --> 01:21:21,340
<i>Alors,</i> our murderer
approaches the sandwiches.

1023
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:26,053
And, at once, he observes that
the colour and the texture are identical.

1024
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:29,139
So, which one is the salmon paste?

1025
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:39,817
No, there's no way on earth
he could distinguish by smell.

1026
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:42,319
So, what can this person do?

1027
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,073
I am affraid that there's only
one thing that he can do.

1028
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,784
He tastes.

1029
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:04,591
It was bad enough
the first time...

1030
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:12,933
But then, suddenly, I realized
how stupid I had been!

1031
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:17,855
I, Hercule Poirot,
had followed my reasoning, yes,

1032
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:22,359
but I had failed to take into account
the madness of the English palate.

1033
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,736
For, gentlemen, what do we find?

1034
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:29,324
What we find is that we are
entering into the realms of lunacy.

1035
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:32,786
I do not care if our murderer had
the palate of a master-chef.

1036
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,872
He could never distiguish
between theses two slurries.

1037
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:40,169
No,it is a fact. These sandwiches
are all but indistinguishable.

1038
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:45,549
Then I came to the conclusion.

1039
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:45,674
I, Hercule Poirot, do not care
what was said at the trial.

1040
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:50,471
This could never, ever, be
the pratical method of murder.

1041
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:53,640
So Elinor Carlisle did not
poison the sandwich?

1042
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,893
- No, she did not.
- Who did?

1043
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,065
Nobody.

1044
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:06,153
- So it was an accident?
- <i>Non, non...</i>

1045
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:10,616
She was murdered, but not
by these disgusting sandwiches.

1046
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:15,329
I said just now that
everyone had lied to me, uh?

1047
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:19,166
For example, the man that
nurse Hopkins saw outside here.

1048
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:22,169
- She was lying?
- <i>Non, non, non.<i> Indeed, she was not.</i></i>

1049
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:27,007
And you know that, Dr. Lord,
because you are aware of who it was.

1050
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:31,178
It was you. Monsieur Horlick
recognised your car,

1051
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,055
but did not want to say so
in front of you.

1052
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:36,600
So, last night,
he came to the hotel to tell it to me.

1053
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,938
So, here is yet another lie, uh?
But why?

1054
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,608
Was it because you feared
for Elinor Carlisle?

1055
01:23:45,776 --> 01:23:49,947
Was it your heart I could forgive?
Or something much more sinister?

1056
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:53,992
All right, all right. I would have done
anything to protect her.

1057
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,204
I was just a fool to think
I could deceive you.

1058
01:23:57,329 --> 01:24:00,874
<i>Oui.</i> Either a fool
or something worse.

1059
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,631
Please, to remain.
I will return.

1060
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:32,239
Do you believe in ghosts?

1061
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:36,827
No, of course not.
I had a message to come here.

1062
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:45,169
<i>Oui.</i> As you know, someone
entered this room

1063
01:24:45,294 --> 01:24:48,338
on the last night that
Madame Welman was alive

1064
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:53,343
and gave to her the morphine.

1065
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:57,806
You told to the court that
you never left the side of your patient

1066
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:00,934
during that evening, except when
Mademoiselle Carlisle was present.

1067
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,022
She was the accused,
so no person could challenge you.

1068
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:07,608
But it is a fact that Mr. Winter
entered this room

1069
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:10,611
when you were making the tea,
and perhaps others.

1070
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:14,490
Maybe I was out a few times.
That's no crime.

1071
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:17,201
That is not your only lie.

1072
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:24,374
When I asked you if
Mary Gerrard was adopted, you denied it.

1073
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,877
Why did you not tell to me the truth?

1074
01:25:27,294 --> 01:25:30,547
What? That?
But it has no baring.

1075
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:35,135
No baring?
You suppose the fact that Mary Gerrard

1076
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,555
being illegitimate daughter of
Madame Welman has no baring on this?

1077
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:44,728
Elinor Carlisle only inherited the money
because she was the nearest next of kin.

1078
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:47,022
Now it emerges that she was not.

1079
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:53,153
At that point, Mary Gerrard stood
to inherit 200 thousand pounds.

1080
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:58,575
Ah, so that's it! It was another motive
for Miss Carlisle to do away with her.

1081
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,787
On the contrary.
It was no motive at all.

1082
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:05,874
Such an action,
it would have been pointless,

1083
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:10,504
since Mary Gerrard
had already made a will.

1084
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:14,341
Was it you who told her
to do that?

1085
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:19,012
We talked about it.
What are you saying, Mr. Poirot?

1086
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,266
That someone other than Elinor
Carlisle beneficts from her death.

1087
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:24,268
This came to me yesterday

1088
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:30,190
and then I began to think again
about the anonimous letter

1089
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:35,612
designed to breed the distress between
Mary Gerrard and Elinor Carlisle.

1090
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:38,031
And suddenly the light, it began to dawm

1091
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:40,951
about, amongst other things,
New Zealand.

1092
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:43,412
Excuse me.

1093
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:12,399
Well, Mr Poirot, so long as you wanted me
here, I thought I'd make us a cup of tea.

1094
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:15,235
Oh! Thank you. You're most kind.

1095
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:19,490
And now, perhaps you'd tell me
what this is about.

1096
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:22,826
The truth is, nurse Hopkins,
I brought you here

1097
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,620
to talk about this rose.

1098
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:26,497
It is the rose of the treader
from the lodge.

1099
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:28,790
You were pricked, I believe,
by its thorn.

1100
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:31,919
Yes.

1101
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:35,464
But, as you can quite well regard...

1102
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,510
... the Zephirine Rose
it has no thorn.

1103
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:44,515
Well, then it was a nail
from the treaders.

1104
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:47,851
I thought it was a thorn.
It was sharp enough too.

1105
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,147
- Your tea.
<i>- Merci.</i>

1106
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,988
Quite so...

1107
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,574
A mistake...

1108
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:15,921
Tell me, you have lived
in New Zealand?

1109
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,635
How would you discover that?

1110
01:28:23,137 --> 01:28:25,806
Mind you. It is known.

1111
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:28,142
Is it?

1112
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:33,939
The truth is, I have tried to discover it
myself, but without any success.

1113
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,537
It little matters.

1114
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:53,250
But I did have a little more success
in discovering your real name.

1115
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:58,380
Your first name is Mary,
the same as Mary Gerrard.

1116
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:05,679
And your surname is Riley,
the same as her adoptive mother.

1117
01:29:09,308 --> 01:29:12,352
Poor Mary, she did never guess
who you really were, did she?

1118
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:17,649
And that letter you showed me,
you never discovered it here at the lodge.

1119
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:20,444
<i>Non,</i> that was a letter you received.

1120
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:23,906
You know, at the time I thought
the writing was rather strange.

1121
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:27,242
"And so, dear Mary,

1122
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:32,331
"I have had to keep this secret
from the girl I brought up."

1123
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:37,544
So why would the writer address
her daughter directly as Mary

1124
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:40,589
and then proceed to talk
about her in the third person?

1125
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:45,052
Because it was not
a mother writing to her daughter at all.

1126
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:49,765
<i>Non.</i> It was a mother
writing to her sister,

1127
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:56,230
confessing the secret ot the true
parentage of her adopted daughter.

1128
01:29:56,563 --> 01:30:02,402
Yes, it was your letter, sent to you,
her aunt in New Zealand.

1129
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:06,240
And this planted a temptation
which grew.

1130
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,159
What temptation?

1131
01:30:09,368 --> 01:30:11,036
The temptation of a big inheritance.

1132
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,539
And it was for that reason
that you came here.

1133
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,750
You tried to store her feelings
against Mary

1134
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,212
with your poisonous pen,
the anonimous letter.

1135
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,549
You killed Madame Welman,
knowing that she had made no will

1136
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:26,885
and even tricked poor Mary
into making a will

1137
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,222
<i>in favour of her kind aunt
in New Zealand,</i>

1138
01:30:30,514 --> 01:30:34,101
encouraged by the postcards
and presents which you arranged.

1139
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:41,275
Oh yes, she was named after you
and yet you killed her.

1140
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:46,280
Later, you would release
that sad letter,

1141
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:49,283
ensuring that the
settlement would change.

1142
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:54,121
And, from a safe distance,
clame your money.

1143
01:30:58,709 --> 01:31:02,337
This is a strange sort of fiction,
Mr. Poirot.

1144
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,594
But, so long as you finish
your tea, I'll wash up.

1145
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:21,398
But I still worried about the scrap
of label that they discovered here.

1146
01:31:22,483 --> 01:31:24,985
Oh, certainly it said morphine,

1147
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:28,614
but there was one bit
that did not quite fit, uh?

1148
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:31,408
The small "m".

1149
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:35,913
Why not the capital?

1150
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:39,875
And eventually I realized
that it was only

1151
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,337
part of the name of
the drug that they discovered.

1152
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,217
It was incomplete
and not for morphine at all.

1153
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:52,387
And I searched, and searched

1154
01:31:53,514 --> 01:31:56,850
and, at last, I discovered
a drug of great interest.

1155
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:01,772
Apomorphine! An emetic.

1156
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:07,611
Yes, an emetic, Mr. Poirot.
Apomorphine makes you vomit.

1157
01:32:08,362 --> 01:32:10,739
If you are poisoned
and than inject that,

1158
01:32:10,948 --> 01:32:13,450
you vomit quite enough
to expell the poison.

1159
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:17,412
And so it was the tea.

1160
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:25,462
You poisoned it,
you drank it with Mary.

1161
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:31,176
A little while later,

1162
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:35,889
Elinor Carlisle find you with
a prick from the needdle in your arm,

1163
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:39,810
standing over basin
where you'd been so sick.

1164
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:43,480
And now, I have to do it again.

1165
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:48,902
The poison's safely washed up,
though luckily I had much less than you.

1166
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:53,991
Not morphine this time,
something nastier.

1167
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:57,661
But nobody will quite know
how it entered your system.

1168
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:00,497
And there's no trace of it.

1169
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:09,006
Oh, but my dear lady, there is.

1170
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:13,844
You see...

1171
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:20,809
... I hate, and always have hated, tea.

1172
01:33:30,402 --> 01:33:36,533
And here... is your emetic.
I removed it from your bag.

1173
01:33:41,455 --> 01:33:42,915
Give me that!

1174
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:47,711
Come on, lads!

1175
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:57,387
You filthy foreigner!
There was no way they could've found out!

1176
01:33:58,222 --> 01:34:00,974
Poirot, come now.
We have a car waiting.

1177
01:34:01,809 --> 01:34:03,894
We need to hurry.
There's no time to waste.

1178
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:10,150
And Dr. Lord also, if you please.
I think you will be needed.

1179
01:34:11,819 --> 01:34:13,362
Monsieur Winter.

1180
01:34:36,176 --> 01:34:38,387
This is for you.

1181
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:41,431
It is from the lodge
and it saved your life.

1182
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:45,769
You have been acquitted.
You are free to go.

1183
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:46,854
But--

1184
01:34:47,354 --> 01:34:49,940
There is someone outside
who will explain to you everything.

1185
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:52,860
Amongst other things,
who it was that wrote to you your letter.

1186
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,196
And it is to him that you
should give the thanks.

1187
01:35:06,331 --> 01:35:10,919
Monsieur Poirot,
you know what I told you. I--

1188
01:35:11,462 --> 01:35:16,884
Mademoiselle Carlisle, wanting a
death is no crime.

1189
01:35:19,553 --> 01:35:23,015
<i>Bon?</i> Now go...

1190
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:39,698
May I take you home?

1191
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,826
Yes.

1192
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:26,620
