1
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,106
Hello, darling.
Managed to slip away,

2
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:01,153
but I think I sprang my bloody wrist.

3
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,448
Oh, John...

4
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,804
How is work?

5
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:31,933
<i>Fine, thanks. I'm doing a big
abstract to the International Exhibition.</i>

6
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,270
How's yours?

7
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,315
I might be making some progress
in the Ridgeway's Disease.

8
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,318
I've a patient in Hammersmith
Hospital, Mrs. Crabtree,

9
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:43,403
she's a driver's wife, I believe,

10
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:44,863
she's dying of Ridgeway's.

11
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:50,327
But she's allowed me to try
some new treatments on her.

12
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,995
By God, she's got some spirit!

13
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,624
Poor, frightened old thing that she is.

14
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,087
And all I get from Gerda is,
"Why are you out so late?"

15
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,882
Well, sometimes you're with me.

16
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:09,429
Hmm, but all the time I'm married
to Gerda.

17
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,100
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

18
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:19,981
Yes.
Will I see you this weekend?

19
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,485
- Yes. Are you going?
- Yes.

20
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,239
- Well, that will be lovely.
- Yes. Henrietta, come here.

21
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:45,192
<i>It's going to be a complete disaster.</i>

22
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,652
It's always the same
when I invite Gerda.

23
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,321
I wish I hadn't,

24
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:53,575
but the worst thing is that
she's so terribly nice.

25
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,995
One has to have her, of course,

26
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,790
it would be so terribly rude
to invite John without her.

27
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,419
On the other hand,
it does seem so odd, doen't it?

28
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,508
Someone as nice as Gerda should be
so voyd of any kind of intelligence.

29
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:16,473
I often think, if she had any spirit
at all, she'd stay away.

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,600
Henrietta will help, of course.

31
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:22,771
Strange how good Henrietta
is with Gerda.

32
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,900
- What're you talking about, Lucy?
- The weekend is upon us, Midge.

33
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,027
The guests will be arriving
any minute.

34
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,864
And I'm just trusting to Henrietta
to make conversation,

35
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,991
because John and Gerda...

36
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,995
... it's a nightmare,
John and Gerda.

37
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,956
Lucy, do you know what time it is?

38
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,377
I'm sorry, darling,
I have absolutely no idea what time it is.

39
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,212
It's a quarter past six!

40
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,758
Midge, I am sorry!
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:55,971
Come, come, come,
go back to your dreams. Good night.

42
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,771
- There you are, Mrs. Pearstock.
- Thank you very much, Dr. Christow.

43
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,526
Goodbye.

44
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,837
Are you alright?

45
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,716
I'm tired.

46
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,509
A weekend in the country
will make you feel better.

47
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,764
Yes. Unfortunately,
Gerda is driving.

48
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,824
- Victor!
- Mr. Poirot, sir, have a good trip?

49
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,285
Without incident,
thank you. Victor,

50
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,123
Victor, what is that smell?
- Smell?

51
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:08,126
Can't smell anything, sir.
Just good country air.

52
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:23,391
Collie, the telephone number
is on the pad, in the surgery.

53
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,684
Call me if there's trouble.

54
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,977
There'll be no trouble,
Dr. Christow.

55
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,896
- Goodbye, children.
- Bye, daddy!

56
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,940
Be good!

57
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:36,655
It won't start.

58
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,408
Switch on the ignition, Gerda!

59
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,707
- I'm so stupid. I'm sorry.
- Let's just get there, shall we?

60
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,752
I wish we could stay at home.
The Angkatell frighten the life out of me.

61
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,047
- Goodbye, children!
- Bye mummy. Bye daddy!

62
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:16,236
The weather's said fair
for the weekend.

63
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,780
Everything's spick and span
(immaculate) at the cottage,

64
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:20,866
the wife's seen to that.

65
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,118
I am sure I shall be
most comfortable.

66
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:28,748
It will be a relief, I expect, escape
the fumes and stink of London.

67
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,505
I say!

68
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,675
<i>Milles tonnerres!</i>

69
00:07:43,972 --> 00:07:45,807
Why must you spent so many hours
at the hospital

70
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,851
when you've a perfectly surgery
at home?

71
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,605
<i>It's research, Gerda!
Research, as I've explained before.</i>

72
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,194
- Why are you slowing?
- It might be about to turn red.

73
00:07:57,652 --> 00:08:00,614
- But it isn't, is it? It's green.
- Oh! Sorry...

74
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,409
I just become convinced
it'd suddenly...

75
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,297
Oh, God, Gerda!

76
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,106
Gudgeon!

77
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,195
Hello, Midge!
Great to see you!

78
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:43,615
- What a gorgeous car!
- He's a Legonda.

79
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:45,450
Goes like the wind!

80
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,911
Thank you, Gudgeon.

81
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,080
- Hello, Lucy.
- Henrietta!

82
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,082
Wonderful to see you.

83
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:56,878
I supose that, by the time you take
that magificent steed of yours to the stable,

84
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,506
give it a rub down and a nosebag,

85
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,174
lunch might be ready.

86
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:05,554
- Who's coming?
- The Christow.

87
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,390
- And Edward's arriving after lunch.
- Good.

88
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,729
Looks like you'll have some company,
Mr. Poirot.

89
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,440
Someone has taken
the cottage next door.

90
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,119
Mr. Poirot!

91
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,329
<i>Enchanté, Madame.</i>

92
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,665
Everything is beautiful,
as usual.

93
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,459
But tell me, someone has taken up
residence at Dovecotes?

94
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,461
Yes, sir. A lady.

95
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,213
An actrice, they say.

96
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:57,981
How's the dreaded dress shop?

97
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,485
Bloody awful!

98
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,988
- Hello there!
- Edward!

99
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,449
Hello, Midge!

100
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,201
Hello, Henrietta!

101
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:29,638
But tell me, Madame Simms,
what is this?

102
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,725
I did not expect any mail
to this address.

103
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,436
It's from Lady Angkatell,
up at The Hollow.

104
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,901
<i>Pour ce soir?</i>

105
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:49,866
How are things at Ainswick,
Edward? Just as lovely as ever?

106
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,118
Why don't you come and see?

107
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,959
You're always welcome.

108
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,752
Anytime.

109
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,838
Anytime at all.

110
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,340
You are sweet.

111
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,801
And Ainswick is the best place
in the world.

112
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,470
Do you remember our special tree?

113
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:14,224
Igdrasil. The secret sign
we used to draw everywhere?

114
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,351
Fancy a breath here?

115
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,199
My God! Igdrasil.
Who drew that?

116
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,244
You did.

117
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,967
So, what've you been doing,
since I saw you last?

118
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,429
Nothing.

119
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,807
That sounds... peaceful.

120
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,853
You could find peace

121
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,897
at Ainswick, with me.

122
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,987
I wish I wasn't so dreadfully
fond of you, Edward.

123
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,950
Makes it so much harder to go on
saying " no".

124
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,290
What you really mean is that you won't
marry me because of John Christow.

125
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,586
- Why doesn't the fellow get a divorce?
- Because...

126
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,004
That's it, isn't it?

127
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,298
If there'd be no John Christow
in the world,

128
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:30,967
you'd marry me.

129
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,391
<i>I used to spent my holidays
with Edward, at Ainswick.</i>

130
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,602
<i>It seemed so vast.</i>

131
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:46,024
14.000 acres, is bound to be vast, Midge.
Oh, how I miss it!

132
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:48,318
- Why didn't you inherit it, Lucy?
- Midge,

133
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,739
you know very well girls don't inherit.
It's the way the world wags.

134
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,910
Edward isn't even my cousin,
he's family's second cousin.

135
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,703
But he's still in tail.

136
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,082
Ainswick falls like rain,
right plop in his lap.

137
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:05,669
- Aren't you remotely bitter about that?
- No, of course not.

138
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,796
I've invited that crime fellow
for dinner.

139
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,507
I'm sorry?

140
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,884
That's why I was in your bedroom
so early, this morning.

141
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,928
I had this premonition, you see.

142
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:18,056
That we were to have
terrible foughts, for dinner.

143
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,684
So, him being here,
just could be a distraction.

144
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,853
What crime man, Lucy?

145
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:26,022
He was in Bagdad
when Henry was High-Comissionary.

146
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,942
He stays in one of those funny little cottages,
down the lane.

147
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,362
I remember he wore this pink
flower on his button hole

148
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:36,366
and he was solving something,
I can't quite remember what.

149
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,620
But of course I'm not terribly interested
on who killed whom.

150
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,582
I mean, once you're dead,
you're dead

151
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,750
it doesn't matter why, does it?

152
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,674
I'm no good in anything.

153
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,177
I don't know why you ever married me.

154
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:58,847
You needed taking care of,
that's why I married you.

155
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:01,808
I try to be a good wife, John.

156
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,437
This may not be
the best time to tell you...

157
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,063
You know I love you, don't you?

158
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,608
Of course I know,
but I have to warn you...

159
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,151
No one else, just you.

160
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,321
We'll never make it
to Shovel Down in third.

161
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,026
Very fair shooting, Edward.

162
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,612
Now, there.
Your turn, Henrietta.

163
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,366
See if you can kill
a burglar.

164
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:08,041
- Well done!
- No, you only winged him.

165
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,960
Hello, everyone! Hello, Henry!

166
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:13,213
- It's the Christow!
- Hello. So sorry we're late.

167
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:16,299
Not at all, not at all, just in time
for sporting target practice.

168
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,094
Nice to see you, John.
Now then, Gerda, come along.

169
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:21,096
- Try to put one in bullseye.

170
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:22,931
<i>I've never tried.</i>

171
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,516
- Hello, darling.
- Darling.

172
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,768
- I think you may have met Midge Hardcastle?
- Yes, of course.

173
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,229
And of course you know my
second cousin, Edward.

174
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,064
- How do you do, Edward?
- Hello, John.

175
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,900
<i>- What's going on?
- Henry's brought the artillery.</i>

176
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,443
Has he indeed?

177
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:45,245
I sprang my bloody wrist.

178
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,247
Careful.

179
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,044
Did I miss? I bet I missed.

180
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,298
My turn, is it?

181
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:59,551
Gerda, how lovely to see you!

182
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:02,971
Thank you, Henry.

183
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,559
Come along, Gudgeon.

184
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:17,944
I say, Lucy!

185
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,947
That's nothing. Once,
on the Asian side of the Bosphorus,

186
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,782
I was jumped by a couple of thugs.

187
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,869
We were rolling about in the dirt, we were.
Then, before I knew it,

188
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:28,497
she'd shot one in the leg
and one in stomach.

189
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,790
How she didn't hit me,
God alone knows!

190
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,501
It's quite simple!

191
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,254
You do it very quickly
and you don't think about it, Henry.

192
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:43,178
Sena has in ballet class.
Point shoes, the whole lot.

193
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,263
- And Terence?
- Chemistry.

194
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,432
Always trying to blow things up.

195
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,893
He's planning to make nitroglycerine
while were away.

196
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,897
- But don't tell John anything.
- Oh, I shan't.

197
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:58,235
- And you?
- Oh, I've taken up Leathercraft.

198
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,404
Do you like this?

199
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,864
I made it.

200
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:07,786
It's so nice talking to you.

201
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,206
But I suppose it will soon
be time for dinner.

202
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,376
Gerda...

203
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:17,420
... why do you come here
if you hate it so much?

204
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:20,215
I want John to be happy.

205
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:24,177
- He could come without you.
- No, he wouldn't like that.

206
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,806
He wouldn't enjoy it without me.
He said so.

207
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,351
<i>John is overly unselfish.</i>

208
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,313
I'd rather stay in Harley Street,
to be frank,

209
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,649
but he thinks it is good for me,
to get out into the country.

210
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,651
Oh, the country's alright.

211
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,154
No need to throw in the Angkatells

212
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,242
We're an odious family.
Come on, let's go in and get changed.

213
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,744
There's some sort of detective
coming in, apparently.

214
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:58,670
You wouldn't believe it.

215
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,130
Monsieur Poirot has habilities

216
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,215
one has to say,
quite phenomenal.

217
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,926
It's absolutely true, the talk about
there was in Bagdad.

218
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,013
Monsieur Poirot
and his little "green" cells.

219
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,056
Grey, Madame.

220
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,811
Pardon me. But we're awfully lucky
to have him as a neighbour.

221
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,147
I mean, in case anything went wrong.

222
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,294
Would you give it all up
if  I asked you to?

223
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:41,421
And come and live with me?

224
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:42,714
No.

225
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,300
No?

226
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:49,054
It's not really what you want.

227
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,932
Couldn't you lie to me,
just once?

228
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,518
- Why?
- Because I love you, Henrietta.

229
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:59,314
But you're so... damn it all,
so detached.

230
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:04,194
Your art, your cars,
your friends.

231
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,154
I want you to think
you only need me.

232
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,114
Isn't that what Gerda does?

233
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,742
Don't you tell me you care a damn
about Gerda.

234
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,329
Why not?

235
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:16,164
I like Gerda.

236
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,839
- Dinner, Milady.
- Thank you, Gudgeon

237
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,384
Please, Monsieur Poirot.
Come this way.

238
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,677
<i>Merci.</i>

239
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,722
Has anyone seen John?

240
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,147
Well, the customers are awful!

241
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,857
One has to put up far more insolence

242
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:43,400
in a dress shop
than Gudgeon

243
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,777
or Simmons or any decent
domestic does here.

244
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,113
It must be absolute hell, darling.

245
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:50,907
But why does one has
to be so proud?

246
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:55,620
Anyone having to earn one's living,
doesn't have to be the end, has it?

247
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,290
It's all about self-esteem,
surely?

248
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,292
You're the expert on that.

249
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,423
So, how do you do it then,
Monsieur Poirot?

250
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,052
I beg your pardon, <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

251
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,138
To solve so many crimes?

252
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,561
Merely I use the process
of the thought logic

253
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:22,272
and once the process
it has been applied,

254
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,692
alors, the mistery
becomes <i>éclairé</i>

255
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,987
<i>and the criminal mind
it is uncovered.</i>

256
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,616
But that assumes that you're
cleverer than the criminal, doesn't it?

257
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,286
I am not sure that it does, Mademoiselle.
Logically.

258
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,622
Oh, I think it does.

259
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:42,083
What happens if you come across one
who's cleverer than yourself?

260
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,338
This is not the highest probability,
<i>Mademoiselle</i>.

261
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,342
Have you ever been to Deauville,
<i>Monsieur...?</i>

262
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:53,595
Careful, sir. Henrietta
has a very sharp tongue.

263
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:06,024
After dinner, we use to
play games. Perhaps charades.

264
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,569
But tonight I think it would be
most appropriate,

265
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:12,072
<i>if we were to essay
the Murder Game.</i>

266
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:15,283
Lucy, don't you think Monsieur Poirot
would be rather bored...

267
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,203
Someone has to pretend to be dead.
Murdered.

268
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,998
And then we all have to find out
who did it. It's such fun!

269
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,543
It usually turns out to be Gudgeon.

270
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:28,463
Lady Angkatell,
it's a proposition that is most delightful,

271
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,633
but I'm one who retires early to his bed.

272
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,511
Your dinner, it was superb.

273
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,847
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

274
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,183
I hope that we shall resume
our conversation at another time.

275
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,644
I'd like that, <i>Monsieur Poirot.</i>

276
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,064
- Sir Henry.
- Mr. Poirot.

277
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:48,525
An evening that was most delightful.

278
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:49,943
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,612
I know!
You must come to lunch tomorrow.

280
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:55,323
Oh, yes! He must, mustn't he?

281
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:58,243
<i>Pardon,</i>
but tomorrow I am <i>engagé.</i>

282
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,872
Nonsense, there's absolutely
nothing to do around here,

283
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,082
for miles and miles and miles.

284
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:07,586
I insist you come to our sunday
lunch.

285
00:22:07,711 --> 00:22:08,879
Henry, tell him

286
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:12,299
I do not take kindly to being disobeyed.

287
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,176
We'd be very pleased to have you, old man.

288
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:19,347
<i>Et bien.</i>
It will be my pleasure to attend.

289
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:21,016
Thank you.

290
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,684
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

291
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,894
Good night, Mr. Poirot.

292
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,312
- Good night.
- Good night.

293
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:33,904
Ace of diamonds.

294
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:37,824
Why on earth did you lead
that diamond, Gerda?

295
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:42,412
Oh! I... was it wrong?

296
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:45,040
Don't be absurd,
she had to lead the diamond.

297
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,917
The only sane thing to do.

298
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,178
Game and rubber. Well done.

299
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:01,515
- Wait, did we win?
- A lucky finesse!

300
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:20,242
- You cheated.
- Was it obvious?

301
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,078
So that Gerda would win.

302
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,415
Honesty means nothing to you,
does it?

303
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,044
Good evening!

304
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,966
- Who the devil are you?
- Veronica Cray, Sir Henry.

305
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:39,219
Please, please, forgiving me for
barging in upon you like this.

306
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:41,388
I'm the dinky little house,
up the lane

307
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,558
and I've had the most frightful
catastrophe.

308
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:47,310
Please, come on in.
Henry, close the window.

309
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,273
What happened?

310
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:54,651
I've run out of matches.
On a Saturday night!

311
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:56,319
And I smoke like a chimney... truly.

312
00:23:56,987 --> 00:24:00,365
I feel a complete fool,
but there's not a match in Dovecotes

313
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:04,161
so I've come to beg some from my
only neighbours within miles and...

314
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:09,458
- My God!
- Hello, Veronica.

315
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,086
My God, it's John Christow!

316
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,506
Matches, was it?

317
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,301
<i>This is too, too extraordinary!</i>

318
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,219
- Do you know each other?
- We did...

319
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,348
... a long time ago.
- Yes, John's an old friend.

320
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,768
<i>He was the first guy
I was ever in love with.</i>

321
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:32,522
Midge, would you kindly ring the bell?

322
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:35,484
I thought you were just wonderful!

323
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,777
<i>Weren't we really madly
in love?</i>

324
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:40,489
Veronica, this is my wife.

325
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:44,534
How lovely to meet you.

326
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,205
Ah, Gudgeon,

327
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:50,791
tell me, do we have plenty of matches
in the house?

328
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,835
<i>- A dozen boxes came today, milady.
- Excellent.</i>

329
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,839
- Would you kindly get six?
- Very good, milady.

330
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,135
And... how do you like Dovecotes?

331
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:06,181
Oh, I adore it! It's so cute
and so close to London...

332
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:08,683
And, yet, we feel
so gloriously isolated.

333
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:14,314
We kindda lost touch
when I went to California, didn't we?

334
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,984
- You've been to California?
- Oh, I live there, actually.

335
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:19,986
I just popped over to do a little play.

336
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,322
One has to keep up to hand,

337
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,825
and say hello to
Shaftesbury Avenue and all that.

338
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,787
My dear Lady Angkatell,
I surely won't need all these.

339
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,622
We have plenty in the house.

340
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:35,335
Besides, I always think
it's rather tiresome

341
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:36,628
only having one of a thing, don't you?

342
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:39,422
This is very kind
of you, thank you.

343
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,009
Will you see me back to my cottage?

344
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:46,763
I want dreadfully to know
what you've been up to

345
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:50,100
in all those years and years,
since I've seen you.

346
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:54,271
I'm so sorry to have bothered you
in this pathetic way, Lady Angkatell,

347
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,982
- Night, night.
- Good night.

348
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,086
- That was Veronica Cray!
- Indeed.

349
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,964
We must catch up
one of her pictures, Henry.

350
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,342
If that little performance is anything
to go by,

351
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:27,512
we will certainly get our money's worth.

352
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:33,894
- I assure it's true
- It can't be!

353
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:37,355
- I'm not joking...
- No, it's not true!

354
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,024
It is true.

355
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,717
Come on, John. Come on.

356
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:01,792
What time is it?

357
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,670
Uh... I've-- I've no idea.

358
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:09,007
Sorry to wake you.

359
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,304
I had to go in for a drink
with the woman.

360
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:19,267
Good night, John.

361
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,103
Good night.

362
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,241
Morning.

363
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,244
- Morning.
- Morning.

364
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,622
We're shooting after breakfast.

365
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:44,543
- We might bag a few pigeon.
- You wanna come?

366
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:47,587
No, thanks.

367
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:51,258
I feel a bit shattered,
to be honest.

368
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,395
For me?

369
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:05,355
It came this morning, sir.

370
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,359
We have to talk about our future.

371
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:34,986
I'm sorry?

372
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,199
Our future, John!
We've wasted 12 years.

373
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:45,205
I'm not going back to the States.

374
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,124
I'm going to make my life here,
with you.

375
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,546
You've this...

376
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,215
... you've got this
taped out all wrong.

377
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:59,719
We had quite a time together,
last night, but Veronica, you know

378
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:03,014
our lives are completely
divergent.

379
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,059
I mean, when we split up,
12 years ago,

380
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,813
well,... that was just it.
We split up.

381
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:13,066
<i>We didn't split up.
You ditched me.</i>

382
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,735
<i>I was your fiancée
and you ditched me!</i>

383
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:18,280
I couldn't go with you to Hollywood.

384
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,739
I had to finish Med School.

385
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:21,283
Of course, to being a doctor.

386
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:23,994
<i>Well, you go on being a doctor,
I don't mind.</i>

387
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,873
My dear girl, I'm married.
I have children!

388
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:30,667
I know.

389
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:34,254
I'm married myself,
at the moment.

390
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,383
It's nothing a good divorce lawyer
can't fix.

391
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,262
John...
I always did want to be your wife.

392
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:45,348
<i>You see, I have this passion,</i>

393
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,436
<i>this overpowering passion!</i>

394
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,438
- We have to be together.
- No.

395
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,815
That is not going to happen!

396
00:32:54,024 --> 00:32:56,651
- But last night...
- Last night...?

397
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,738
Look, you're not a child!

398
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,032
Last night was a one off.

399
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:07,245
Are you saying you don't love me?

400
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:11,958
You are a very,
very alluring woman, Veronica,

401
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:15,212
but I don't...
love you, no.

402
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,509
I came all this way to find you!

403
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,385
Waited in this ghastly hovel (hut)

404
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:24,554
for the weekend
for you to be here!

405
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,348
You see I knew...

406
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:29,184
... that if we could be,
just once more, together,

407
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,311
... just once more

408
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:33,647
You-- you planned it?

409
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:37,150
You belong to me, John.
You're mine!

410
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,195
When I was young man,

411
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,739
I wanted to share my life with you
and you wouldn't do it.

412
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:45,867
Because my career is so much more
important than yours.

413
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:48,120
Anyone can be a doctor.

414
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:52,374
You're a nasty piece of work!

415
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:56,545
<i>You leave me again,
I'll really make you sorry!</i>

416
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:58,755
So be it!

417
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:03,510
Goodbye.

418
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:08,098
I hate you more than I thought
I could hate anyone!

419
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:35,738
Good day, sir.

420
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,408
<i>Lady Angkatell would like you
to come to the pavillion, sir,</i>

421
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,077
for a glass of cherry.

422
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,122
- Out of doors?
- Would you care to follow me, sir?

423
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:03,474
<i>Merci.</i>

424
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:08,604
Milady?

425
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,447
I see that you are playing
the "Murder Game".

426
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,367
<i>Alors, très bien.</i>

427
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:23,661
I congratulate you all.

428
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:47,810
Henrietta...

429
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,985
- Allow me, madam.
- Give that to me, Gerda!

430
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,486
<i>Mademoiselle</i>, do no...

431
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,753
Poirot? What's happened?

432
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,255
Gerda has mur... I mean...

433
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:18,215
John has been shot.

434
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,469
He's dead.

435
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:31,813
Isn't really my line, murder.

436
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:34,983
<i>Non</i>, but the procedure
it has been followed quite correctly

437
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,694
and, until the police arrive,

438
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:40,989
all we can do is to ensure
that the body it is undisturbed.

439
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:43,700
<i>and that nobody tampers
with the evidence.</i>

440
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:46,953
It's... it's a bit chilly.

441
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,166
- You alright if we wait in the pavillion?
<i>- Oui, bien sûr.</i>

442
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:11,311
<i>Can I offer you a cherry?</i>

443
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,648
<i>Non, merci</i>.
It's better not to touch.

444
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,191
- I suppose we can smoke.
<i>- Oui.</i>

445
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:17,776
<i>Non, non, merci.</i>

446
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,072
A very able fellow, Christow.
Very able.

447
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:28,495
Slightly too able,
if you take my meaning.

448
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,003
I just don't know what to do about lunch.

449
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:39,339
It seems so heartless
to be seating around a table,

450
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:42,551
stuffing oneself
as if nothing had happened.

451
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:44,511
Don't worry on my account, Lucy.

452
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:48,432
God bless you, dear Edward,
but say what you will,

453
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:51,351
murder is a very awkward thing.

454
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:56,189
It upsets the servants so,
breaks whole routine out.

455
00:39:57,107 --> 00:39:59,484
The worst of all, it was duck
for lunch,

456
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:01,737
my very, very favourite!

457
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,698
What about Gerda, Midge?

458
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:07,576
Perhaps something on a tray
would be good.

459
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,955
I've placed sandwiches and some coffe
in the dining-room, milady.

460
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,333
Gudgeon, thank you!

461
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,757
Gudgeon really is a jewel, you know?

462
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:26,303
And a proper, substantial sandwich
is as good as lunch.

463
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:29,264
And there's nothing remotely heartless
about them,

464
00:40:29,473 --> 00:40:30,932
if you know what I mean.

465
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:34,227
- Lucy, don't! This is all so awful!
- Oh! Midge!

466
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,147
Don't cry, little Midge.

467
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:51,912
Monsieur Poirot,
this is Inspector Grange.

468
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:53,622
I expect you've heard
about Monsieur Poirot.

469
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,791
- I most certainly have.
- Inspector.

470
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,877
May I ask you what brings you
to these "neck o da woods"?

471
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:01,838
Well, I visit this "neck of the woods",
Inspector,

472
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:03,632
for the weekends.

473
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,634
My friends persuaded me
to purchase a cottage here.

474
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,303
It is the second one, in that way,
along the lane.

475
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,847
Are you fond of the countryside,
aren't you, sir?

476
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,557
<i>Le paysage</i> is most,</i>

477
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:15,143
except for the trees,
have this untidy habit

478
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,770
of dropping leaves.

479
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:22,609
And that path leads to the lane,
you say?

480
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:23,819
<i>Oui.</i>

481
00:41:24,027 --> 00:41:25,320
And that path leads to the farm

482
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:27,364
and that's where
Lady Angkatell came?

483
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,741
Edward Angkatell and Miss Savernake

484
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:31,702
came from the woods separately

485
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:34,830
and then they stood there and there?

486
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,583
<i>Oui,</i> it was like one
<i>mis-en-scène</i> from the theatre.

487
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:47,509
I'm giving Gerda some brandy.

488
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:49,719
Oh, how thoughtful of you, Henrietta.

489
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:52,430
Yes, I was remembering,
we were given a brandy,

490
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,682
for shock, when I was a little girl,
at Ainswick.

491
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:58,561
Of course, I suppose it's not
exactly a shock with Gerda, is it?

492
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:01,314
Personally, I don't know

493
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:04,567
how I would feel
if I'd just murdered my husband,

494
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:10,198
but wouldn't exactly be shock,
would it?

495
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:12,325
I mean, there wouldn't be
no element of surprise.

496
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:14,452
Why are you so sure
that Gerda killed John?

497
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:16,120
It seems so evident.

498
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:18,122
Why, what else do you suggest?

499
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:21,376
Isn't it possible that Gerda
came along to the pool,

500
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:23,002
found John lying there

501
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:26,214
and just picked up the revolver
when we came on the scene?

502
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:33,930
This is what Gerda says?

503
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,599
Yes.

504
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:43,815
Oh! Well,

505
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:50,530
fortunately, duck is...

506
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,407
quite pleasant cold.

507
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,617
I couldn't lie down any longer.

508
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:59,998
I still can't believe
that it's real.

509
00:43:01,624 --> 00:43:03,001
That John is dead.

510
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:06,045
Who could have killed him?

511
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:08,715
Who could possibly
have killed John?

512
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:19,193
This is my wife, Inspector Grange.

513
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,820
Lady Angkatell.

514
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:24,990
I was hoping to have a word
with Mrs. Christow.

515
00:43:25,574 --> 00:43:26,867
There she is.

516
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:33,332
- Mrs. Christow?
- Yes, I'm Gerda Christow.

517
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,751
I should just want to ask you a few--

518
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:37,795
He was a wonderful doctor.

519
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:40,631
So kind, so unselfish.

520
00:43:41,507 --> 00:43:44,843
The best of husbands.
Who could've wanted to kill him?

521
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:47,930
What exactly happened,
Mrs. Christow?

522
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:49,932
It was all so sudden...

523
00:43:52,142 --> 00:43:53,435
I went out from the house,

524
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:57,397
and along the path
to the swimming pool...

525
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:59,024
What time was this?

526
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:03,362
About 12:58. I noticed the clock.

527
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:06,657
And, when I got there,

528
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:09,368
there was John, lying there,

529
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,287
and blood...

530
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,124
- Did you hear the shoot?
- Yes.

531
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,794
No... I don't know.

532
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:21,964
Sir Henry and Edward
were out shooting.

533
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:26,051
I just saw John... blood
and a revolver.

534
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:29,513
- And I picked up the revolver...
- Why?

535
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:33,392
I beg your pardon?

536
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:35,352
Why did you pick it up?

537
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:39,982
I don't know.

538
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:43,360
Shouldn't I have?

539
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:58,834
So you have decided that
Madame Christow shot her husband?

540
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:02,504
Yes, sir. Don't you think she did it?

541
00:45:04,756 --> 00:45:06,842
It could have happened
as she said.

542
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:10,637
Yes, could have.
But it's a very thin story.

543
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:13,974
They all think she did it.

544
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:18,061
And you thought she'd done it,
didn't you?

545
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:20,814
When you first arrived
on the scene...

546
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,525
I am not sure what I thought.

547
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:27,529
Something was not <i>exactement</i>
as it should have been.

548
00:45:30,824 --> 00:45:32,409
What's that?

549
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:35,996
Looks like leather work, sir.

550
00:45:38,832 --> 00:45:41,335
- Oh, right.
- Sir, we got the weapon.

551
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:44,213
Come on, pick it up.

552
00:45:45,047 --> 00:45:49,051
Been in the pool, destroyed any
fingerprints that might have been on it.

553
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:55,766
Yes, it comes from my collection.

554
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,852
It's my hobby, Inspector.

555
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:08,487
- When did you last see this one?
- Yesterday afternoon.

556
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:10,823
We were doing some target practice.

557
00:46:11,156 --> 00:46:13,325
Who actually fired the gun
on that occasion?

558
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:15,994
I think we all had at least
one shot with it.

559
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:18,497
- Including Gerda Christow?
- Including Gerda Christow.

560
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:20,249
And after the shooting?

561
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,210
I put the firearm back
in its usual place.

562
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,927
Will Sir Henry require a late supper,
milady?

563
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,512
There is some duck leftover.

564
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:38,392
No, Gudgeon, he's driving
Mrs. Christow up to London as we speak.

565
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,018
He's staying at his club.

566
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:43,105
Gudgeon, about those eggs...

567
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:46,942
I meant to write the date on them,
as per usual.

568
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:51,029
But, because of the confusion...
Could you kindly ask the cook?

569
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,282
I've seen to it myself,
milady.

570
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,284
Oh, bless you, Gudgeon.

571
00:46:57,286 --> 00:46:59,746
- Do you think Gerda will be alright?
- Oh, yes.

572
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:03,542
She'll probably send for some
old school friend of hers.

573
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:06,170
She's probably got three or four.

574
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:10,632
I can just see them, scrabbling
hockey types, from Turnbridge Wells.

575
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,552
What extraodinary things you do say,
Lucy!

576
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:16,763
Very well, Eastbourne and tennis,
if you insist.

577
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:20,058
I wonder if there're any left...?

578
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:24,438
- School friends?
- No! Policemen.

579
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:27,858
Don't they normally leave one
hovering in the hall?

580
00:47:28,108 --> 00:47:31,069
Or outside, peeking behind a bush,
watching the door?

581
00:47:31,403 --> 00:47:33,906
In case another murder
is comitted in the night?

582
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,365
Lucy, don't...

583
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,952
I'm so sorry, how stupid of me,
of course.

584
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,789
Gerda is on her way back to London.

585
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,751
Oh, dear. I didn't mean...

586
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:51,673
Tomorrow, I think it's better
to telephone the shop, you know.

587
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:54,468
Just tell them about the inquest.

588
00:47:54,968 --> 00:47:57,429
Just say you're staying off here
for a few days.

589
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,425
I haven't said anything, but...

590
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:21,637
... you do know how sorry I am?

591
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:23,388
Sorry?

592
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:26,892
That John Christow's gone?
You didn't like John.

593
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:29,978
He and I hadn't much in common.

594
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:34,233
You had me in common.

595
00:48:34,399 --> 00:48:37,152
Henrietta, for God's sake!
No need to be like that.

596
00:48:38,153 --> 00:48:40,739
What did you think I'd be like?

597
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:43,951
Did you think I'd seat and cry
for a pocket handkerchief

598
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:46,203
while you'd held my hand?

599
00:48:46,745 --> 00:48:48,372
You're nice enough, Edward,

600
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:54,294
but, honestly,
you are inadequate.

601
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:43,870
<i>Alô?</i>

602
00:49:44,454 --> 00:49:45,622
Yes.

603
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:27,873
Monsieur Poirot,
we could use your brains.

604
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:29,958
Join us, would you?

605
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:36,298
So...

606
00:50:37,841 --> 00:50:40,093
... which of the ladies did
this wrap belong to?

607
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:44,014
I take it, sir, that you're referring
to the cape of artic fox.

608
00:50:44,348 --> 00:50:47,851
<i>I noticed it yesterday, when I took
the cherry out to the pavillion.</i>

609
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,397
But it is not the property of anyone
in this establishment, sir.

610
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:55,317
Well, who's is it, then?

611
00:50:55,609 --> 00:50:57,861
It might possibly belong to Miss Cray,

612
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,072
the motion picture actrice.

613
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:04,242
She payed a visit after dinner,
the night before last,

614
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,495
for the purpose of borrowing
some matches, sir.

615
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:10,666
<i>Did she take away six boxes?</i>

616
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:14,378
That is correct, sir.

617
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,006
Servants are the devil, aren't they?

618
00:51:18,882 --> 00:51:20,550
Still Sir Henry identified the gun.

619
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:24,054
Which means that all Mrs. Christow
had to do was to get it from the study.

620
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:25,472
Don't you agree?

621
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:30,727
- And her motive, what is it?
- Motive? Jealousy, I'd say.

622
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,396
<i>La jalousie?</i>

623
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:35,023
<i>Peut-être.</i>

624
00:51:35,232 --> 00:51:37,317
You know these fancy doctors.

625
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:40,988
He'd probably get one of those rich
lady patients a good "see to".

626
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:44,866
And Lady Angkatell mentioned
some trouble with a nurse.

627
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:46,702
But she was a bit vague.

628
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:49,121
Yes, she would be vague.

629
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:53,959
I'm taking the train off to London.

630
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:56,920
I'm going to Harley Street.
Would you care to join me?

631
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:06,555
I don't remember any quarrels. No.

632
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,016
Mrs. Christow was devoted
to her husband.

633
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:11,184
Quite slavishly so.

634
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:13,603
- Tyrannical, was he?
- No.

635
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:16,940
But he was what I would call
a selfish man.

636
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:21,570
He took it for granted that Mrs. Christow
would fall in with his ideas.

637
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:25,449
You organized his appointments,
Miss Collins.

638
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:28,702
Any difficulty with patients?
Lady patients?

639
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:31,663
He had an excellent manner
with patients.

640
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:32,956
Yes, but any...

641
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:35,500
... hanky panky?
- Certainly not.

642
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:38,170
What about Mlle. Veronica Cray?

643
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:39,630
Veronica Cray?

644
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:42,132
Well, we believe she was a friend
of Dr. Christow's.

645
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:43,383
- Do you mean the actrice?
<i>- Oui.</i>

646
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,344
I'd no idea he knew her.

647
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:48,805
Any ideas as to whom
might have killed Dr. Christow?

648
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:50,974
Absolutely none at all, Inspector.

649
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:54,353
When the body was discovered,
Mme. Christow was standing beside it,

650
00:52:54,394 --> 00:52:56,563
with a revolver in her hand.

651
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,774
Look, I don't know who you are,

652
00:52:59,149 --> 00:53:01,610
but if you think Gerda Christow
killed her husband,

653
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:03,695
you are categorically wrong.

654
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:09,201
- It's the Inspector, Mrs. Christow.
- Thank you, Collie.

655
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:15,207
- Good afternoon.
- My friend Elsie,

656
00:53:15,832 --> 00:53:18,669
I mean, Mrs. Patterson.
- Ma'am.

657
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:21,922
This is Monsieur Poirot.

658
00:53:22,172 --> 00:53:24,132
Have you found out who killed him?

659
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,010
Uh... no, not yet Ma'am.

660
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:31,390
- Was it you, Mrs. Christow?
- That's unfair!

661
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:35,894
- Why do you persecute the poor woman?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

662
00:53:36,186 --> 00:53:39,189
But perhaps Madame Christow
would prefer to speak for herself.

663
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:41,733
It was not me.

664
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:43,944
No.

665
00:53:44,236 --> 00:53:47,030
It is a hard thing, to kill
the one you love, <i>n'est ce pas?</i>

666
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:49,366
A very hard thing, I should imagine.

667
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:52,244
I couldn't do it.

668
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:14,474
Balistic's report. We ran it
right away.

669
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,268
Have a look at that, Poirot.

670
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,072
<i>Merci, Madame.</i>

671
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,409
So the balistics report proves
that the gun in the pool

672
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:34,703
was not the one who killed
John Christow.

673
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:37,873
I've spoken to Sir Henry.

674
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,586
He says that there is a gun missing
in his collection.

675
00:54:43,045 --> 00:54:46,506
<i>A .38 Smith & Wesson,
brown holster.</i>

676
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:53,055
I think this whole thing
could be a frame

677
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,599
set up to implicate Mrs. Christow.

678
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:58,143
But, if that was so,

679
00:54:59,436 --> 00:55:02,314
<i>why do not leave the right revolver
lying by the body?</i>

680
00:55:03,148 --> 00:55:05,067
But she might not have pick it up.

681
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,986
And it is possible, Inspector,

682
00:55:08,654 --> 00:55:11,281
that the murderer might be someone
who wanted to kill Dr. Christow,

683
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,701
but did not want to implicate
Gerda Christow.

684
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:18,789
Well, he had a funny way
to work about it.

685
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:21,249
We suspected her right
from the start.

686
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,169
<i>Oui, mon ami.</i>
Very swiftly you suspected her.

687
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:27,506
Look, Poirot. You were a eye witness,
you saw everything.

688
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:29,925
<i>Oui,</i> I saw.

689
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:32,469
But the eyes of witnesses
are most unreliable.

690
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:35,138
Sometimes, the eyes see
what they are meant to see.

691
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,891
You saying it was arranged?

692
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,019
<i>There was something about the tableau,
the people around the pool</i>

693
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:44,731
it was false. And I can not
place my finger on what it was.

694
00:55:48,193 --> 00:55:51,113
<i>There were three people,
Lady Angkatell,</i>

695
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:53,699
<i>Monsieur Edward Angkatell</i>

696
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,617
<i>and Henrietta Savernake.</i>

697
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,787
Henrietta.

698
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:02,249
<i>And anyone of these three people
could have shot Dr. Christow</i>

699
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:04,084
<i>before Madame Christow arrived,
could have retreated</i>

700
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:06,670
<i>by one of the paths, turn around
and returned.</i>

701
00:56:06,878 --> 00:56:08,714
Blimey, you're right.

702
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:11,174
There is also another possibility,
Inspector.

703
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:14,344
Someone could have come
from the path, along the lane,

704
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:16,054
then fired the shot

705
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:19,766
and gone back the same way.

706
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:21,768
You're dead right.

707
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,024
And that could be Miss Veronica Cray.
Crime of passion. Bingo!

708
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:29,234
- You have interviewed her?
- Yes, I have.

709
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,945
Christow went to visit her
that morning.

710
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:34,364
They had a fight.
I spoke to the maid.

711
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:37,284
Cray said to him:

712
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:42,914
"I hate you more than I ever thought
I could hate anyone!"

713
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:45,917
That is interesting.

714
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:49,379
And it was her fur coat in the pavillion?

715
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:50,922
Yes, it was.

716
00:56:51,214 --> 00:56:54,009
<i>She must have left it there when she
entered to borrow the matches.</i>

717
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:56,386
I do not believe she went there
to borrow the matches.

718
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,847
She could have borrowed them from me
and saved the walk.

719
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:00,057
No, no, no.

720
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:02,976
She was nervous,
on account of you being a foreigner.

721
00:57:05,896 --> 00:57:07,481
<i>Et bien...</i>

722
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,084
<i>- Santé.
- Santé.</i>

723
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:36,426
You know something about human nature,
don't you?

724
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:40,222
I know a little
about human nature.

725
00:57:41,515 --> 00:57:45,185
Inspector Grange has got into his head
that I quarreled with John Christow

726
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:47,688
on the day he died.

727
00:57:48,063 --> 00:57:49,481
And did you?

728
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:53,568
I hadn't seen John for 12 years.

729
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:58,448
But the real truth is so fantastic that I'm
certain that a guy like Grange wouldn't believe it.

730
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:02,286
But I think you might
understand.

731
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:04,746
I am flattered, <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

732
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:06,623
Actually, I am married.

733
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:09,084
<i>Madame.</i>

734
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:14,006
<i>12 years ago, John was
very in love with me.</i>

735
00:58:15,007 --> 00:58:16,717
Even obsessively so.

736
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:18,552
<i>He wanted me
to give up acting,</i>

737
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:20,345
<i>having a life of my own,</i>

738
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:22,139
<i>even a mind of my own</i>

739
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,100
He was so possessive and domineering

740
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:29,187
I thought I couldn't go through with it
and I broke off the engagement.

741
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:33,191
I'm affrai he took it
rather hard.

742
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:37,571
When we came back here,
on saturday night,

743
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:40,157
the whole thing blew up again.

744
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:43,702
He went mad,
quite literally mad.

745
00:58:44,202 --> 00:58:48,415
<i>He wanted to leave his wife and children,
he wanted me to divorce my husband</i>

746
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:53,295
he wanted us to get back together.

747
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:57,466
He carried a torch for me,
all these years.

748
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:01,345
We argued and argued,

749
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:04,389
and in the end I had to send him
back The Hollow.

750
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:06,224
Next morning, he returned.

751
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,019
I told him it was impossible.
He insisted.

752
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:11,813
I told him I didn't love him,
I could never love him

753
00:59:12,022 --> 00:59:15,150
and I begged him not to ruin
my life a second time.

754
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:18,862
I had to be brutal.

755
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,782
Yes, I...

756
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,827
... said I hated him.

757
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:28,497
And we parted in anger. And...

758
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:32,376
... now he is dead.

759
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:40,050
- It is a tragedy.
- Undoubtedly.

760
00:59:44,846 --> 00:59:47,724
Do you think I should say any of this
at the inquest?

761
00:59:48,058 --> 00:59:50,394
I mean... his wife.

762
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:54,898
I can not see that it has any bearing
at the inquest.

763
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:56,900
It is private.

764
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:00,862
And perhaps it should remain so.

765
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:18,005
I talked with the kitchen maid, sir.
Simmons.

766
01:00:18,088 --> 01:00:19,172
She says that, Sunday afternoon,

767
01:00:19,172 --> 01:00:21,842
she saw the butler walk across the hall
with a revolver in his hand.

768
01:00:22,259 --> 01:00:23,760
I'm very sorry, sir.

769
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:26,054
I suppose I ought to have mentioned it.

770
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,266
At about 17:30, I noticed
a revolver lying upon the hall table.

771
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:34,479
<i>I picked it up and brought it in here.</i>

772
01:00:34,855 --> 01:00:37,441
There was a gap up there on the shelf,
so I put it where it belong.

773
01:00:37,899 --> 01:00:39,818
Which one, Gudgeon?

774
01:00:44,823 --> 01:00:46,700
This one, sir.

775
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:49,661
But that is not a revolver.
That is an automatic pistol.

776
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:52,706
I'm very sorry, sir. I'm affraid
I'm not fully informed about firearms.

777
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:56,001
Sir Henry, I'll have it
fully checked for fingerprints.

778
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:58,879
Oh!... I doubt there will be
any fingerprints, sir.

779
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:02,299
Why not?

780
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:05,677
Because I polished it
with my handkerchief before replacing it, sir.

781
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,097
Why the devil did you do that?

782
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:11,516
I felt it might be dusty, sir.

783
01:01:17,022 --> 01:01:19,107
How nice to see you, Monsieur Poirot.

784
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,652
Oh, dear! There's a poor girl
in the kichen,

785
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:23,862
just sobbing her heart out.

786
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,075
What have you been telling them
about the pistol, Gudgeon?

787
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:32,454
<i>Never mind, it doesn't matter.
I'll explain everything.</i>

788
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,206
You may go.

789
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,042
Dear poor Gudgeon, you know.

790
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,004
He tries so hard to protect us
from any kind of trouble...

791
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:44,299
This here is all quite feudal, you know?

792
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:47,469
But he didn't find the pistol
in the hall at all.

793
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:49,137
No, no, no.

794
01:01:49,346 --> 01:01:51,473
He found it when he took out the eggs.

795
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,475
Eggs? What eggs?

796
01:01:54,185 --> 01:01:56,896
You see, I went out to the farm
to collect the eggs.

797
01:01:57,229 --> 01:01:59,064
I put the pistol on the egg basket

798
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,484
and then I put the new eggs
on top of the pistol.

799
01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:03,694
When I came back and saw John
laying there,

800
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:05,696
well... I mean, unwell...

801
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:09,325
<i>... I sort of had a bit of a shock
and almost dropped the basket.</i>

802
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:12,995
<i>Dear sweet Gudgeon, as per usual,
sprang to my rescue.</i>

803
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:16,999
Later on, I wanted to write
the date on the eggs,

804
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,420
otherwise, you see, we tend to eat
the fresher eggs before the older ones,

805
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:23,798
and that simply will not do...

806
01:02:24,381 --> 01:02:27,468
And then Gudgeon told me
he had taken care of everything.

807
01:02:30,304 --> 01:02:33,057
And which pistol was that,
Lady Angkatell?

808
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:35,100
That was the Mauser.25.

809
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,938
And why did you put it into the basket?

810
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:42,274
Oh! I knew you would ask me that,
Monsieur Poirot.

811
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:47,488
Of course I... must have had a reason,
mustn't I, Henry?

812
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:51,909
I mean, I must have had some idea
worrying about in my head,

813
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:56,288
in order for me to put the Mauser
into the egg basket, in first place.

814
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,708
My wife is...

815
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:02,337
<i>... extremely absent-minded.</i>

816
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,115
Sir Henry, if I may ask you a question.

817
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:11,286
How many people, in general, know
that the police can identify a gun

818
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:13,372
<i>by the little marks
on the bullet.</i>

819
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:14,498
The marks of the riffling.

820
01:03:14,623 --> 01:03:17,751
I think that's pretty well common
knowledge nowadays, Poirot.

821
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,555
I was just taking the dog for a walk.

822
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,016
I love peaking
in other people's houses.

823
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,143
Do you mind if I take a look?

824
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,396
But certainly, <i>Mademoiselle,
entrez,</i> if you please.

825
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:41,441
I would be most grateful, however,
if the dog might be kept outside.

826
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,581
How beautifully tidy!

827
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,586
You'd hate my studio.
There's clay all over the place,

828
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,422
and glaze, and paint bottles...

829
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,800
But I understand,
you are an <i>artiste.</i>

830
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,470
Aren't you an artist too,
Monsieur Poirot?

831
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:13,599
On the whole, I would say...

832
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,394
<i>... non.</i>

833
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:20,231
<i>I've known crimes that were artistic,
supreme exercises of imagination.</i>

834
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,483
But the solving of them, <i>non.</i>

835
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,612
The criative power
is not what is needed.

836
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,658
<i>What is required
is a passion for truth.</i>

837
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:34,328
And, once you have the truth,

838
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,539
once you have knowledge,
is that enough?

839
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,624
Or do you have to go one step further

840
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,793
and transform
the knowledge into action?

841
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:48,058
Why did you come here,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Savernake?

842
01:04:49,976 --> 01:04:52,145
As I said, I was
taking the dog for a walk.

843
01:04:52,312 --> 01:04:55,899
It is odd I did never take notice
of a dog on my visits to the Angkatell.

844
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:02,239
That might be because
they haven't got one.

845
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:06,117
I borrowed the gardener's.

846
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:09,162
Don't actually like animals much,
dogs, horses...

847
01:05:09,913 --> 01:05:12,290
horrible, smelly things.

848
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:18,004
I am not, <i>Monsieur Poirot,</i>

849
01:05:18,588 --> 01:05:20,006
<i>terribly truthful.</i>

850
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,634
<i>Non.</i>

851
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:26,763
But I think that you have integrity.

852
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:32,936
The inquest is tomorrow.

853
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:34,855
Is it necessary, do you know,

854
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:37,858
the Police to know
that I was John Christow's mistress?

855
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,068
You were lovers?

856
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:43,989
I do not think that the Police
has any difficulty in discovering this.

857
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:47,450
I suppose not.

858
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,830
Why should Gerda bear
such heavy burden?

859
01:05:52,622 --> 01:05:55,625
She adored John
and now she is dead.

860
01:05:58,044 --> 01:06:00,589
I didn't break up his married life.

861
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:04,342
I was one of a procession, along
with Veronica Cray and all the others.

862
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,720
- So he was like that?
- No!

863
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,058
He was a noble man,

864
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:15,645
a fine man.

865
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:21,985
He was doing a vital research
into a debilitanting disease.

866
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,738
It's called Ridgeway's,
there is no known cure.

867
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:27,324
He was working on it night and day,
for months.

868
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:29,826
His curiosity,

869
01:06:30,577 --> 01:06:32,704
his determination...

870
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,415
Oh! I wish I could make you understand.

871
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:38,543
- But I understand.
- Really?

872
01:06:40,962 --> 01:06:43,131
You mentioned Veronica Cray.

873
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:46,885
She also was a friend of Dr. Christow?

874
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,096
They were engaged
to be married 12 years ago.

875
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:51,807
Were they?

876
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,975
<i>Look, I'll make it simple.</i>

877
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,980
Veronica was, and is,
a bitch of the first water.

878
01:06:59,564 --> 01:07:01,441
She wanted John to give up
medicine

879
01:07:01,608 --> 01:07:03,443
and go and live with her
in Califórnia.

880
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:07,322
So he broke off
and subsequentely married Gerda.

881
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:11,284
He had a number of affairs,
which Gerda never knew nothing about.

882
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:14,788
But he really never got over Veronica.

883
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:18,792
And in the last Saturday they met,

884
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:22,003
for the first time in 12 years.

885
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:27,175
He went out to see her home

886
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:31,096
and he returned to the Hollow
at 03:00 a.m..

887
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,014
Yes. How do you know?

888
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:36,351
The housemaid had a toothache.

889
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,229
Lucy has far too many servants.

890
01:07:39,354 --> 01:07:41,314
And how is it that you know?

891
01:07:41,815 --> 01:07:43,525
I was watching out my window.

892
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:46,778
The toothache, <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

893
01:07:48,155 --> 01:07:51,616
Quite another kind of ache,
Monsieur Poirot.

894
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,082
If you see me with a pistol in my hand,
Simmons, the proper thing to do

895
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:02,127
<i>is come to me and say:
Mr. Gudeon, would you be so kind</i>

896
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,629
and give me an explanation.

897
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:07,132
Yes, Mr. Gudgeon.

898
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,012
The improper thing to do
is to go babbling to the Police.

899
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:14,931
That is common.

900
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:19,936
Where would Her Ladyship be,

901
01:08:19,936 --> 01:08:22,189
if we all run
doing things like that, hmm?

902
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,065
Lucy, why did you take the pistol?

903
01:08:25,484 --> 01:08:27,611
I'm not entirely sure, Henry.

904
01:08:28,028 --> 01:08:30,655
I do recall, though, waking up
that morning

905
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:33,283
with some sort of premonition,

906
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:36,745
that there might, just might,
be some kind of accident..

907
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:39,539
Accident, who might
have had an accident?

908
01:08:39,956 --> 01:08:41,833
Well, obviously, John Christow.

909
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:44,794
<i>And, I mean, one does feel awfully
sorry, of course,</i>

910
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:48,507
and one does tend to blame oneself...
- Good God, Lucy!

911
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:49,925
Oh, Henry!

912
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:52,594
Oh, Henry! Oh, Henry,

913
01:08:54,554 --> 01:08:58,600
I'm so dreadfully worried about Ainswick.

914
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,395
If Edward never marries,

915
01:09:02,562 --> 01:09:04,231
and he won't, you know,

916
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:05,899
if Henrietta turns him down,

917
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:08,735
it will all die out. It will.

918
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:13,573
They will break it up
and sell it off in little tiny pieces.

919
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:16,493
Lucy,

920
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,997
does it really, honestly, matter?

921
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:23,250
Of course it matters.

922
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,002
Ainswick is my home.

923
01:09:26,878 --> 01:09:30,006
It's all our land. No...

924
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:32,300
Somebody'd got to get rid of him.

925
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:35,220
Lucy, you didn't...

926
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,055
Don't be such a fool.

927
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:40,058
Do you really believe, for a moment,

928
01:09:40,267 --> 01:09:42,561
that I could've shot him?

929
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,522
I invited him here, Henry.

930
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:48,859
One doesn't ask guests
for the weekend

931
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:50,861
and start bumping them off.

932
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:54,156
- Did your aunt like John Christow?
- Lucy?

933
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:56,741
Lucy's a cousin, not an aunt.

934
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,702
Yes, she liked him very much.

935
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:01,955
And your... also cousin,
Mr. Edward Angkatell,

936
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:04,875
- did he like Dr. Christow?
- Not particularly.

937
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,794
And do they like Madame Christow?

938
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:10,755
It's not a matter of liking her,
she's famíly.

939
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:13,675
- Is she?
- We're not all rich, you know?

940
01:10:13,884 --> 01:10:16,303
Gerda is from a branch
of rather humble Angkatell's.

941
01:10:16,636 --> 01:10:18,805
She's tolerated, I think it's fair to say,

942
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,223
because she's one of us.

943
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:21,808
And your understanding of tolerance

944
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:23,560
would be to sleep with her husband?

945
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:41,953
Why did you take the revolver
out of the hand of Madame Christow

946
01:10:42,787 --> 01:10:44,831
and drop it into the pool?

947
01:10:44,998 --> 01:10:46,625
A Gerda is very clumsy.

948
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,543
She might have fired it
and hurt someone.

949
01:10:48,627 --> 01:10:50,629
But you're not clumsy,
are you?

950
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:52,047
<i>And yet you dropped it.</i>

951
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,175
If there were fingerprints
on that revolver,

952
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,303
that is to say, fingerprints
before <i>Madame</i> Christow handled it,

953
01:10:58,512 --> 01:11:00,722
it would've been intersting
to know who's they were.

954
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:03,391
Meaning that you think
that they were mine.

955
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,936
<i>You're suggesting that I shot John</i>

956
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,395
and then left the revolver beside him

957
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:09,564
so that Gerda could come along
and pick it up.

958
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:13,151
But if I'd done that, give me
credit for enough intelligence,

959
01:11:13,318 --> 01:11:15,529
to have wiped my own figerprints off first.

960
01:11:15,862 --> 01:11:18,907
But, Mademoiselle, you have
enough intelligence to know

961
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,034
that if there would be no fingerprints
in the revolver, other than Madame Christow's,

962
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:24,204
other than </i>Madame</i> Christow's,
it would be <i>très remarcable.</i>

963
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,081
Because you were all shooting
with the revolver

964
01:11:26,122 --> 01:11:27,499
the day before.

965
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:31,336
And there are something else we have
just discovered.

966
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:23,870
We now know that the revover that was
dropped into the pool

967
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:37,133
was not the revolver that killed
John Christow.

968
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:39,469
He was shot with a quite different gun.

969
01:11:40,637 --> 01:11:42,305
And you think that I shot him?

970
01:11:43,181 --> 01:11:44,641
When he was dying,

971
01:11:45,016 --> 01:11:47,394
John Christow said:
"Henrietta."

972
01:11:48,728 --> 01:11:50,438
I told you, we were lovers.

973
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,607
Oh yes, of course . He was your lover.

974
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:55,277
So, as he was dying, he says,
"Henrietta."

975
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:56,778
Very touching.

976
01:11:56,903 --> 01:11:59,906
- I don't think there is any need to sneer.
- I am not sneering.

977
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:02,242
But I do not like being lied to.

978
01:12:03,493 --> 01:12:05,912
I've admitted
that I'm not very truthful.

979
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:10,083
But I don't kill people, Monsieur Poirot.

980
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:38,028
Gerda! Poor dear, Gerda.

981
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,865
I'm so sorry. Not getting too
a little sleep, I trust.

982
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:45,202
What is an adjournment, you know?
You must be famished.

983
01:12:45,452 --> 01:12:47,787
Why don't you come back
to the Hollow for lunch?

984
01:12:47,913 --> 01:12:49,748
I'm taking Gerda directly home.

985
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:53,084
She needs rest and quiet,
not this.

986
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:03,053
What did they see in Christow?

987
01:13:03,637 --> 01:13:06,264
That wretched woman
is completely heartbroken.

988
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:08,600
- Poor devil.
- Are you all packed?

989
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,520
I'm getting lift to town.
All set.

990
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:14,105
Come on, Midge. Bye, Edward.

991
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,068
Bye.

992
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:21,238
Edward!

993
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,418
- Damn cold!
- It is, rather.

994
01:13:42,092 --> 01:13:45,554
What's this one?
It looks a bit like Gerda.

995
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:48,223
Cowed and hunched.

996
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:50,016
She modelled for me.

997
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:53,395
Don't you dare tell her
that's what what I ended up with.

998
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:55,272
I call it "The Worshiper".

999
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,648
Who is she worshiping?

1000
01:13:58,024 --> 01:13:59,192
John.

1001
01:14:05,115 --> 01:14:07,492
Did you understand all that business
with the second gun?

1002
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:11,621
No, but it lets Gerda off the hook,
doesn't it?

1003
01:14:13,665 --> 01:14:16,877
Let's have some tea and toasts,
then I'll take you to your lodgings.

1004
01:15:09,846 --> 01:15:11,264
Mademoiselle, do not!

1005
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:17,061
John has been shot. He's dead.

1006
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:35,705
Edward, Midge,
how wonderful to see you both!

1007
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:40,960
He rescued me from Madame Alfrege.
It was frightfully romantic.

1008
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:44,005
I was whisked from the shop and taken
to lunch at The Connaught

1009
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,091
and, do you know what?
I never went back.

1010
01:15:48,092 --> 01:15:50,428
I'm a dull dog, I know.
I am no much good at anything.

1011
01:15:50,553 --> 01:15:52,597
I just read books, putter about.

1012
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:56,100
Midge has agrred to come to Ainswick
and be my wife.

1013
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,187
And nothing could make me happier.

1014
01:15:59,312 --> 01:16:01,105
Of white satin, don't you think?

1015
01:16:01,606 --> 01:16:04,317
And ivory Prayer Book.
What about bridesmaids?

1016
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:06,819
Oh, I don't fuss.
Just a quiet wedding.

1017
01:16:06,944 --> 01:16:09,697
I quite agree. They don't match,
do they?

1018
01:16:09,822 --> 01:16:13,409
I mean it, there's always
a rather plain one, that ruins the whole--

1019
01:16:14,994 --> 01:16:17,914
Absolutely dozens of them,
poking about in the woods,

1020
01:16:18,623 --> 01:16:21,167
making a terrible mess
with all the pheasants!

1021
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:22,710
Why are they still here?

1022
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:25,046
They're searching for
the missing revolver, Midge.

1023
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:48,444
<i>Bonjour, Mademoiselle.</i>

1024
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,905
Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.

1025
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:55,368
Will they find it, do you think?

1026
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,911
Soon, I should say.

1027
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:02,583
You have returned very suddenly
from London, Mademoiselle.

1028
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:05,086
There's a party for Midge
and Edward,

1029
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:07,505
who, believe it or not,
are getting married.

1030
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:11,592
Why, did you think the murderer
would return to the scene of the crime?

1031
01:17:15,054 --> 01:17:16,931
You know, it did seem to me,
from the very beginning,

1032
01:17:17,098 --> 01:17:19,559
that either this crime was very simple,
so simple

1033
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:22,645
that it was very difficult to believe
in its simplicity,

1034
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:24,605
<i>or it was very complex.</i>

1035
01:17:25,064 --> 01:17:26,649
And it is to say

1036
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:30,320
that we are contending against a mind
that is able of inventions

1037
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,530
that are intricate and ingenious.

1038
01:17:33,489 --> 01:17:35,908
<i>So that every time we seem
to be heading towards the truth,</i>

1039
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:39,037
we're actually being led away from it.

1040
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:41,289
A mind that is subtle

1041
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:43,499
and yes, very ingenious,

1042
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,544
which is plotting agaist us
the whole time.

1043
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:48,504
And succeding.

1044
01:17:51,883 --> 01:17:53,801
What is that to do with me?

1045
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:57,472
It is a creative mind, <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

1046
01:17:58,431 --> 01:18:02,060
- And this is a strange tree.
- It's a Igdrasil.

1047
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:04,604
A memento of my childhood,

1048
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:07,357
I draw it everywhere, doodling,
you know.

1049
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,530
I've seen it before, in the pavillion,
by the pool.

1050
01:18:14,989 --> 01:18:16,324
In the pavillion?

1051
01:18:16,616 --> 01:18:19,369
Where it must have been drawn
on Sunday morning.

1052
01:18:20,203 --> 01:18:21,954
Oh yes, on the little table.

1053
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:25,124
- But that was on Saturday afternoon.
<i>- Non, non...</i>

1054
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,544
<i>It was not there when Gudgeon
brought the cherry glasses.</i>

1055
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:33,383
- Then it must have been in Sunday afternoon.
- Non,

1056
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,637
because Grange's men
did not leave the area until dusk.

1057
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:41,307
Oh, yes! I remember.
It was after dinner, on Saturday.

1058
01:18:41,474 --> 01:18:43,059
<i>Non, Mademoiselle Savernake.</i>

1059
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:46,270
People do not doodle in the dark.

1060
01:18:47,647 --> 01:18:50,149
No, I think you were in the pavillion
on Sunday, after 12:00,

1061
01:18:50,316 --> 01:18:51,943
<i>when Gudgeon brought out
the cherry glasses.</i>

1062
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,738
I think you stood by the table,
watching someone, waiting for someone

1063
01:18:55,947 --> 01:18:57,740
and you doodled.

1064
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,707
I didn't go down to the pool until 13:00.

1065
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,502
Just after John Christow
had been shot.

1066
01:19:11,254 --> 01:19:13,589
But Igdrasil testifies against you.

1067
01:19:13,756 --> 01:19:15,508
You were there and shot Dr. Christow

1068
01:19:15,758 --> 01:19:18,344
or you were there and saw who did.

1069
01:19:18,678 --> 01:19:20,555
This is outrageous!

1070
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:23,016
Do you think you are cleverer than I?

1071
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:41,284
The inquest resumes tomorrow,

1072
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:45,496
and all I've got is vague suspicions
leading to nowhere.

1073
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:49,292
Nowhere, instead of somewhere.
That is it.

1074
01:19:50,543 --> 01:19:53,880
Do you know, half the time I think
those Angkatells know all about it.

1075
01:19:55,506 --> 01:19:57,216
Oh, they do know all about it.

1076
01:19:58,468 --> 01:19:59,969
Henrietta Savernake?

1077
01:20:00,136 --> 01:20:03,139
Nothing from her either.
She went straight to Chelsea.

1078
01:20:03,264 --> 01:20:05,725
I searched her studio
with a fine tooth comb,

1079
01:20:06,726 --> 01:20:10,229
but there's no gun.
Just art pieces.

1080
01:20:11,022 --> 01:20:13,733
Sculptures,
funny looking horses,

1081
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,361
bits of wood, metal...

1082
01:20:16,944 --> 01:20:19,405
- Horses, did you say?
- Wel, one horse.

1083
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:21,366
If you can call it a horse.

1084
01:20:21,532 --> 01:20:23,826
- A horse?
- Yeah, what's so fascinating about that?

1085
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:26,412
It's a point of psicology, Inspector.

1086
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:29,415
How quickly can you get me up
to London?

1087
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:52,063
What're you looking for, sir?

1088
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:10,164
This.

1089
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:12,709
The horse.

1090
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:17,839
<i>Merci.</i>

1091
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,550
Quite good, actually.

1092
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:52,623
<i>Merci.</i>

1093
01:22:01,466 --> 01:22:02,842
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

1094
01:22:06,346 --> 01:22:08,890
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Savernake
doesn't like horses.

1095
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,108
<i>Voilá.</i>

1096
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,741
I think that this will prove to be
the murder weapon.

1097
01:22:30,787 --> 01:22:33,414
- So Miss Savernake did it.
<i>- Non!</i>

1098
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,835
Looks to me bloody likely.

1099
01:22:38,378 --> 01:22:42,090
No, Mademoiselle Savernake
is not, in my opinion,

1100
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,342
a murderer.

1101
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:50,598
Let us be quiet about our discovery,
for the time being, Inspector.

1102
01:22:51,891 --> 01:22:53,309
And watch.

1103
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,063
Let us be intelligent.

1104
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:01,609
<i>Is Her Ladyship at home?</i>

1105
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:04,362
You will find Lady Angkatell
in the greenhouse.

1106
01:23:05,905 --> 01:23:08,866
If I might,
the inquest is concluded,

1107
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:12,036
murder by person or persons
unknown.

1108
01:23:12,704 --> 01:23:15,790
Is it necessary to trouble
Her Ladyship further, sir?

1109
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:34,350
Lady Angkatell.

1110
01:23:35,685 --> 01:23:37,061
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

1111
01:23:37,228 --> 01:23:39,897
Tell me, what are your views
on compost?

1112
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,195
I've come to offer you apologies
for the inconveniencies you have suffered.

1113
01:23:47,363 --> 01:23:49,574
It's high time to put a full stop
to the whole thing.

1114
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,328
You do understand me, don't you?

1115
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:56,080
I'm not sure that I do, Lady Angkatell.

1116
01:23:56,664 --> 01:24:01,169
Oh, come, come, Poirot.
You understand perfectly!

1117
01:24:02,045 --> 01:24:05,131
Since Inspector Grange
has failed to find the murder weapon,

1118
01:24:05,715 --> 01:24:07,675
he'll have to let the whole thing drop.

1119
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,971
You, I dare say, won't.

1120
01:24:13,097 --> 01:24:15,975
Non, I shall not let it drop.

1121
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,062
What if were told the truth?

1122
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:21,481
Would you like to tell me the truth?

1123
01:24:22,315 --> 01:24:25,151
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, I would love
to tell you the truth.

1124
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:28,738
Then, of course, we could all agree

1125
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:32,450
that John Christow
is over and done with.

1126
01:24:32,742 --> 01:24:34,243
Could we, Madame?

1127
01:24:38,414 --> 01:24:41,459
You really are very foreign, aren't you?

1128
01:24:44,504 --> 01:24:47,548
Are you quite sure you have not
something, Lady Angkatell?

1129
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:14,826
Something just came upon me,

1130
01:25:16,494 --> 01:25:20,999
you might have overlooked it.

1131
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:25,545
I could be wrong, of course,
and you could've handled everything,

1132
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,381
but since you never mentioned it,

1133
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:30,508
I'm a little concearned...

1134
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:31,926
What's the matter, Lucy?

1135
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,678
- It's the holster.
- What?

1136
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:36,306
Oh Henrietta, the holster!

1137
01:25:37,056 --> 01:25:39,892
The gun was in a holster!

1138
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:02,582
- Yes, Collie?
- It's Miss Savernake.

1139
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:04,751
The holster, Gerda!
Where is the holster?

1140
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:07,337
You have to give me the holster
and then you'll be safe.

1141
01:26:07,503 --> 01:26:09,756
Not completely safe.
<i>Dommage.</i>

1142
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:11,924
Poirot!

1143
01:26:13,885 --> 01:26:14,886
How did you...?

1144
01:26:15,011 --> 01:26:18,014
Sometimes, the fastest car
it is not fast enough, Mademoiselle.

1145
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:21,517
Not when it races against the brain.

1146
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:25,063
Where are the children?

1147
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:28,650
- Elsie's taken them to the Zoo.
- Thank Heaven for that!

1148
01:26:39,452 --> 01:26:41,496
I know that you killed your husband,
Madame.

1149
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,166
Yes.

1150
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,086
I did.

1151
01:26:49,128 --> 01:26:50,755
Why did you do it, Gerda?

1152
01:26:52,131 --> 01:26:53,716
Why did you kill John?

1153
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,843
Because it was all a lie!

1154
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,180
Everything!

1155
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:04,143
I thought he was the noblest man
in the world.

1156
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,774
But I saw his face

1157
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:13,403
when he followed that woman,
that evening...

1158
01:27:21,327 --> 01:27:24,914
I knew he'd loved her,
before he'd married me, but I thought...

1159
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,627
I thought it was over.

1160
01:27:31,754 --> 01:27:35,008
<i>I tried to sleep, but I couldn't.</i>

1161
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:41,681
<i>It was the middle of the night.</i>

1162
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:45,852
<i>I had to know.</i>

1163
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,940
They were there.

1164
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:54,485
I could hear them.

1165
01:27:57,864 --> 01:27:58,948
John

1166
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:03,494
and Veronica Cray.

1167
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:22,722
I believed in him

1168
01:28:23,806 --> 01:28:25,433
as though he were God.

1169
01:28:26,476 --> 01:28:27,852
I worshiped him.

1170
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:32,649
And it was all a lie.

1171
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,320
I had to kill him.

1172
01:28:39,405 --> 01:28:40,698
You do see that?

1173
01:28:43,242 --> 01:28:44,452
I had to!

1174
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:52,168
I am not quite so stupid
as everyone thinks.

1175
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:04,180
<i>I knew I could kill John
and the Police would never know</i>

1176
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:07,725
<i>because I had read in this novel</i>

1177
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:11,062
<i>how they can tell
which gun fires the bullet.</i>

1178
01:29:12,522 --> 01:29:13,982
<i>So, I took two.</i>

1179
01:29:22,573 --> 01:29:26,077
<i>Sir Henry had shown
how to load and fire</i>

1180
01:29:26,244 --> 01:29:27,578
<i>the day before. It was easy.</i>

1181
01:29:27,745 --> 01:29:29,288
You shove the cilinder
back into the frame

1182
01:29:30,456 --> 01:29:31,958
and you're ready for shooting.

1183
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,185
<i>I'd shot with one</i>

1184
01:29:51,936 --> 01:29:53,479
<i>then hide it</i>

1185
01:29:54,981 --> 01:29:58,026
<i>and let them find me
holding the other.</i>

1186
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:02,238
<i>I forgot about the leather thing.</i>

1187
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:06,326
- The holster.
- I forgot about it too.

1188
01:30:07,285 --> 01:30:08,703
I also forgot.

1189
01:30:09,912 --> 01:30:13,791
The memory, it is selective,
<i>n'est ce pas?</i>

1190
01:30:15,752 --> 01:30:19,213
And then I heard Inspector Grange
mention this holster, this holster of leather--

1191
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:24,052
I remembered where I had seen it before.

1192
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:28,306
What's that?

1193
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:33,436
Looks like leather work, sir.

1194
01:30:37,273 --> 01:30:39,942
Where is your bag
for the leather work?

1195
01:30:44,822 --> 01:30:46,532
I-I think it's in the surgery.

1196
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,451
The surgery?

1197
01:30:49,285 --> 01:30:52,997
I seat there. In his chair.

1198
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:58,419
I'll fetch it for you, shall I?

1199
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:06,970
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

1200
01:31:12,892 --> 01:31:14,102
But Madame...

1201
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,939
Oh, I'm not going anywhere,

1202
01:31:20,858 --> 01:31:22,276
don't worry.

1203
01:32:00,898 --> 01:32:03,568
When you return to your studio,
I'm affraid you'll discover

1204
01:32:03,693 --> 01:32:06,487
that one of your sculptures,
it has been destroyed.

1205
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:09,115
It is the sculpture
of the head of the horse.

1206
01:32:15,872 --> 01:32:17,749
It could have worked, <i>Mademoiselle,</i>

1207
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,002
if you did not tell me
how much you detested the creatures.

1208
01:32:24,297 --> 01:32:26,174
I know that you were helped
by your family,

1209
01:32:26,633 --> 01:32:29,010
once they knew what you wanted done.

1210
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,056
Henrietta.

1211
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:35,975
Isn't it possible that Gerda
came along by the pool,

1212
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,685
found John lying there

1213
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:40,605
and just picked up the revolver
when we came on the scene?

1214
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:44,108
This is what Gerda says?

1215
01:32:45,902 --> 01:32:47,070
Yes.

1216
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,367
But why do you wanted it done,
<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

1217
01:32:52,492 --> 01:32:54,202
Because John asked me to.

1218
01:32:55,161 --> 01:32:57,497
That's what he meant
when he said, "Henrietta".

1219
01:32:57,622 --> 01:32:59,457
He was asking me to protect
Gerda.

1220
01:32:59,624 --> 01:33:02,293
And he knew that I'd do
anything he wanted, because...

1221
01:33:03,586 --> 01:33:04,837
... I loved him.

1222
01:33:07,298 --> 01:33:08,508
<i>Oui.</i>

1223
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:22,939
I began to realize the truth

1224
01:33:23,606 --> 01:33:27,568
when I saw there was a pattern,
a pattern to implicate everyone,

1225
01:33:28,403 --> 01:33:30,405
other than Gerda Christow.

1226
01:33:32,407 --> 01:33:35,660
You deliberatly planted Igdrasil

1227
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:38,663
to catch my attention
and put yourself under suspicion.

1228
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:40,999
I put the pistol on the egg basket

1229
01:33:41,165 --> 01:33:43,626
and then I put the new eggs
on top of the pistol.

1230
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,254
Oh, I doubt there'll be
any fingerprints, sir.

1231
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:49,757
Because I polished it with my handkerchief
before replacing it, sir.

1232
01:33:50,717 --> 01:33:53,886
And Lady Angkatell, and the family,
they closed hands and colluded, because...

1233
01:33:55,763 --> 01:34:01,185
There's only one thing to do, if you want
to clear from suspicion the person who is actually guilty,

1234
01:34:04,314 --> 01:34:06,733
suggest guilt elsewhere,

1235
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:09,777
but never localize it .

1236
01:34:16,367 --> 01:34:17,869
<i>- Vite!</i>
- Oh, my God!

1237
01:34:19,078 --> 01:34:20,163
Gerda!

1238
01:34:21,831 --> 01:34:23,082
Gerda!

1239
01:34:28,588 --> 01:34:30,381
Help her, for God's sake!

1240
01:34:34,093 --> 01:34:35,386
It is too late.

1241
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,853
Potassium Cyanide.

1242
01:34:45,021 --> 01:34:46,356
Wife of a doctor...

1243
01:34:47,106 --> 01:34:49,192
<i>She knew exactly what to do.</i>

1244
01:35:19,597 --> 01:35:20,974
What happens to me now?

1245
01:35:26,062 --> 01:35:27,522
Go, my child.

1246
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:32,944
Your place is with the living.

1247
01:35:35,071 --> 01:35:37,240
I will remain here with the dead.
