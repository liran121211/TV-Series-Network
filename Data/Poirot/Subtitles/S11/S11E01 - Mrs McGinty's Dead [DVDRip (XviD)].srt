1
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:09,202
James Gordon Bentley,
you have been tried for murder.

2
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:14,399
Abigail McGinty was found by the baker
on the floor of her sitting room,

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,358
extensive wounds to the head.

4
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:20,756
Her house in Broadhinny
evinced no sign of forced entry.

5
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,476
All the police surgeon was able to ascertain

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,360
was that she'd been hit
with a sharp, heavy implement,

7
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,477
probably some time the night before.

8
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:35,519
You, Bentley,
were suspected from the very beginning.

9
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:41,242
You knew where she kept her money.
You'd recently lost your employment.

10
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:45,246
And then the investigating officer,
Superintendent Spence,

11
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:50,202
found 60 pounds in legal tender
under a stone by the garden path.

12
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,084
So you had the motive,
and you had the opportunity.

13
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,517
Will the defendant please rise?

14
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,838
How do you find the defendant?

15
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:09,197
We find the defendant guilty.

(GASPS OF SHOCK)

17
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,358
JUDGE: James Gordon Bentley,

18
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,046
for the premeditated murder of Abigail McGinty,

19
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:21,284
I sentence you to be taken from here
to a place of execution,

20
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:24,876
there to be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

21
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:35,681
Well done, Superintendent.
You brought a first-rate case.

22
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:38,799
SPENCE: There was never much doubt
about the outcome.

23
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:42,283
But I don't think he did it.
He was just a lad from the village.

24
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:46,802
I daresay, to the jury,
Bentley looked like a murderer.

25
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:50,315
He's a bit unappealing, a bit shifty, but...

26
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,324
...in my experience,
your actual murderers tend to look...

27
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,358
well, cocky.

28
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,998
Not this little fellow.

29
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:04,643
Something in my water says
he just isn't the murdering type.

30
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,478
Which is why I've come to you.

31
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:16,522
I can't shake off this feeling
that I've sent an innocent man to the gallows.

32
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,240
Pale ale, sir. Will that be acceptable?

33
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,039
Marvellous. Thanks.

34
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,278
A creme de menthe, sir.

35
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:27,840
Merci, George.

36
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:32,677
But this man, he had a trial that was fair?

37
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:35,366
I'd say so. He had a decent counsel.

38
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:39,559
So, according to the law, this James Bentley,
he has nothing to complain of.

39
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:43,441
If he's hanged for something he didn't do,
he's got something to complain of.

40
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:45,239
But your job, it is over.

41
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,879
Yes.

42
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:48,918
They put me on a fraud case.

43
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,958
I'm off to Glasgow.

44
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,680
It's a very fraudulent place, Glasgow.

45
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,638
So, what is it that you suggest?

46
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,678
I wondered if you'd look into it.

47
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:02,596
You perceive things in... pardon me,
a funny kind of way.

48
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:07,767
You might find something I've missed.
It's the devil of an imposition to ask you...

49
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,401
Do you know
what is the biggest problem of my life?

50
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,881
- No.
- An abundance of leisure.

51
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:17,159
I will look into this for you,
Superintendent, with great joy.

52
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:21,837
But what if I discover
that James Bentley is guilty after all?

53
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,481
I'll put his head in the noose myself.

- Yeah.

I was taken on
at Breather & Scuttle in Kilchester.

It's about four miles from Broadhinny
on the train.

Well, I never sold no houses,
but I showed a few people round.

66
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,758
Most of them never came back, so...

67
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:09,957
Well, Mr Scuttle let me go.

you can still lodge an appeal.

came back about nine.

104
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,278

It makes me very happy to hear that,

Tell to me, if you please, did he ever
talk about his landlady Mrs McGinty?

He said she gave him kippers too often.

James doesn't like kippers.

110
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,597
And did he ever mention to you
that he knew where she kept her money?

111
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:52,243
Actually, he did. He said she kept it under
a floorboard, because she didn't trust the bank.

112
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,075
He reckoned he could help himself to it any time.

please say so.

were it within my power,

00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,518
Oh, she's dead, poor soul.

172
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,762
She was 64.

173
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:45,516
My uncle died young of pneumonia.
So Auntie goes out as a charlady.

174
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:49,560
There's plenty of rich people hereabouts
who don't know how to mop their own floors.

175
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,404
And your auntie...

176
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,244
did she live in this house for long?

177
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,278
Oh, forever.

178
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,079
And you, Madame Burch?

179
00:11:57,127 --> 00:12:00,483
We were lucky to get this. It's got a garden.

180
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh, so your auntie left you this house in her will?

181
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:06,399
Don't say we wanted her money,
the little bit she had.

182
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,166
Don't think we wanted the house either.

183
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:12,802
But you're not going to say no, are you,
if you inherit?

184
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,838
What did Auntie like?

185
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:18,357
Normal things.
You know, knitting... cats and dogs.

186
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,318
She loved her Sunday papers.

187
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,358
All the film stars and that.

188
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,760
Tea?

189
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,001
Merci.

190
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:45,325
No milk, if you please?

191
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,358
- No milk?
- Non.

192
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:50,001
You foreigners are fussy, aren't you?

193
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,198
Merci, Madame.

194
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:02,640
Bessie, who's this?

195
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:07,238
This is Mr... Ooh, I can't pronounce his name.
He came to see where poor Auntie was killed.

196
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,357
This is my husband.

197
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:14,480
- What are you doing in my house?
- He's got a letter, Joe, from the police.

198
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:27,805
It's like I told your superintendent.
We was at the cinema in Kilchester.

199
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:31,396
That's three miles from Drymouth,
four miles from here.

200
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,678
- But you travel by the train?
- No, mate, can't afford it.

201
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,558
We travel by bike, don't we, Bessie?

202
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,598
Or I don't travel at all.

203
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,479
(SHOP BELL RINGS)

204
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,199
Mademoiselle.

205
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,442
How can I help you, sir?

206
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:55,478
I am Hercule Poirot.

207
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:59,964
And if you please, I would like to buy
some writing paper and some envelopes.

208
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:04,957
This is a nice blue bond.

209
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,562
So, what brings you to Broadhinny, then?

210
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:12,201
The murder of Mrs McGinty.

211
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,238
Oh, that.

212
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,605
That was a shocking carry on.

213
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,446
You knew her well?

214
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,479
We passed the time of day. Anything else?

215
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,518
Yes. If you please,

216
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,001
12 one-penny stamps.

217
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:31,403
Tell to me, you know her niece Madame Burch?

218
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:33,438
I know Bessie Burch.

219
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:36,604
- And Mrs McGinty, she was fond of her?
- Very fond, I think.

220
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:40,003
And the husband of her niece,
Mrs McGinty was fond of him also?

221
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,765
As far as I know.

222
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,677
And when did you last see Mrs McGinty?

223
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,242
Let's think. She died on a Wednesday.

224
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:04,678
It must have been early on Monday.
She came in for a bottle of ink.

225
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,366
- A bottle of ink?
- I expect she wanted to write a letter. Don't you?

226
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,838
Morning, Mrs Carpenter.

227
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:16,082
Miss Sweetiman.

228
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,040
Oh, sorry.

229
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:43,682
- Good gracious, it's you, Monsieur Poirot.
- Madame Oliver. What are you...

230
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:45,206
I'm so sorry.

231
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:47,966
- But what was it?
- An apple core. Won't do you any harm.

232
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,726
What are you doing here in the sticks?
You don't live here?

233
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:51,916
Non.

234
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:55,323
No. You live
in that awful modernist place in town.

235
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,120
- So it's a murder?
- Oui.

236
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,681
- Not my hostess, I hope?
- Who is your hostess?

237
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,524
She lives somewhere around here.

238
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,358
A place called Laburnums.

239
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,125
Any idea where it is?

240
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:14,204
A chap called Robin Upward.
Supposed to be dramatising one of my books.

241
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:17,205
Oh, felicitations, Madame!

242
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,876
To have a work performed on the stage,
superbe! Oh!

243
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,441
Turn to the right.

244
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:26,206
- Who's been killed this time?
- An elderly charlady.

245
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:27,202
Oh.

246
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,602
A young man, he has been sentenced to hang.

247
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,797
But he didn't do it, and you know who did?

248
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,917
- Splendid.
- I do not know who did it.

249
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,277
I'm not even convinced
that the young man, he is innocent.

250
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,318
Men are so slow.

251
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,358
I'll soon tell you who did it.

252
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:43,796
A woman's intuition, that's what you need.

253
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:47,840
Now, if a woman were
head of Scotland Yard, well...

254
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,726
Ariadne!

255
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,282
Oh, Lord, it's him. Shakespeare.
Don't worry, I'll be discreet.

256
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,318
No, Madame, I do not wish you to be discreet.

257
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,164
- Truly?
- Truly.

258
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:05,519
So pleased you could come. I just had
the most fantastic idea for the denouement.

259
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,558
Have you? Good. - Yes.

260
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:10,360
Robin, this is Monsieur Poirot.

261
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,126
- Delighted.
- Enchant? Monsieur.

262
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,601
Come on, let's have a drink.

263
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:21,517
I'm extremely pleased to meet you, Mrs Oliver.
Robin's told me so much about you.

264
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,876
I've read all your books.

265
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:28,556
This is an old friend of mine,
Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

266
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:30,676
Madame.

267
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:33,605
We met in the village. Just by chance.

268
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:37,560
- Robin, get some drinks, get cigarettes.
- Yes, of course.

269
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,757
Are you an author, too, Monsieur Poirot?

270
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,275
Je regrette que non.

271
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,795
ARIADNE: He's a detective. A real one.

272
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:52,760
You know, Sherlock Holmes type.
Deer stalkers, violins, that sort of thing.

273
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:55,605
And he's here to solve a murder.

274
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,241
But who has been murdered, Monsieur?

275
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:02,360
You already know of it, Madame.
It occurred last November, the 22nd.

276
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:03,726
Mrs McGinty?

277
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,485
Oui.

278
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:09,202
- That's all over, surely?
ARIADNE: No, no, it's not over at all.

279
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,920
They've arrested the wrong man.
What was his name?

280
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,400
Monsieur James Bentley.

281
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:17,918
But he didn't do it. Poirot's got to find the real
murderer before they execute the other one.

282
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:21,039
I expect his little grey cells are churning.

283
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,358
It's all frightfully exciting.

284
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:25,806
Ah.

285
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,803
A white lady for you, my darling.

286
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,156
Thank you, my dear.

287
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,801
ROBIN: Mrs Oliver.
- Thank you so much.

288
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,166
Monsieur?

289
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,323
Non, merci.

290
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,924
She used to work here. Mrs McGinty.

291
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,958
If you can call it work.

292
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:48,000
Going through drawers,
peering into one's chequebook, the nerve!

293
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:51,517
Don't get your blood pressure up, Madre.
She had her uses.

294
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,684
Robin, of course you're right.
She did sweep and scrub.

295
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:58,686
Robin is as good as a daughter to me,
Mrs Oliver.

296
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,321
He thinks of everything.

297
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:05,246
You're wasting your time
snooping in Broadhinny.

298
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:08,845
We're all very nice people here.

299
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:13,404
- Good luck with your play.
- Good luck with your murder.

300
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,085
Monsieur.

301
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,118
- Au revoir, Monsieur.
- Au revoir.

302
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,082
Do you have everything that you need,
Madame?

303
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:24,325
Yes, I'm perfectly well provided for.
I have reams of paper, oceans of ink.

304
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:27,757
And I'm sure Robin has gin.
What more does a girl need?

305
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,798
But you have brought your own ink?

306
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,838
Always do.

307
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,878
Who'd be without ink?

308
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:34,916
Madame.

309
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:50,602
No, she always went down to the post office
and used the telephone.

310
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,638
So she never wrote to you at all?

311
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,520
No. Auntie didn't hold with writing letters.

312
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,923
But if someone wrote to her,
she would write back?

313
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,686
I suppose, but who'd write to her, though?

314
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,718
Most of the furniture we sold.

315
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,758
The police kept some things.

316
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,798
But everything else...

317
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,838
Madame, please, allow me to help you.

318
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,878
Ooh... Everything else...

319
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,566
is in here.

320
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,358
Three days before she died.

321
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:11,045
Aren't you staying for lunch?
It's pancakes, if I can get them out of the pan.

322
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,885
No, Madame, it is necessary that I go to London.

323
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:19,285
But I return tomorrow and then perhaps I shall
teach you how to make the omelette. Au revoir.

324
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:22,160
To the station, if you please.

325
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:34,003
"The Sunday Comet. November 19th.

Her kindly relatives in the New World
offered her a home after Craig was sentenced.

328
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:47,285
Changing her name, the pitiful girl
seduced by a cold-blooded murderer,

329
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:49,318
left these shores forever.

330
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:54,077
'My daughter shall grow up
happy and innocent,' she said.

331
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:58,279
'Her life shall not be tainted by the past."'

"Lily Gamboll was too young
to be tried for murder.

But her conduct
during her years at approved school

337
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:22,046
is said to have been exemplary.

342
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:46,842
Mademoiselle Horsfall,
after writing an article such as this,

343
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,764
do you often receive the letters?

344
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:53,358
WOMAN: You bet. Some people have nothing
more constructive to do than write letters.

345
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:57,400
- Look! Let's make this snappy, can we?
- I will endeavour to be snappy.

346
00:22:57,447 --> 00:23:02,157
Tell to me. Do you remember receiving
a letter from a Mrs McGinty of Broadhinny?

347
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,402
McGinty? McGinty? I remember the name.

348
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:06,722
Conked on the head by the lodger, right?

349
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,758
Not a very noteworthy crime.

350
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:10,798
Non. A charlady merely.

351
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,838
I mean, no sex appeal.

352
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:16,766
OK, now I do remember,
McGinty from Broadway. Practically illiterate.

353
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,798
- No, Broadhinny.
- Broadway.

354
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,838
Atrocious handwriting.

355
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,878
So you may have mistaken it?

356
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:25,236
I didn't mistake it. She wrote from Broadway.

357
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:29,599
Something about a photograph. She knew
where there was a photograph like in the paper.

358
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:32,115
Would we pay her anything for it
and how much?

359
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,443
- And how did you respond?
- I sent back the standard reply.

360
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,478
- To Broadway.
- Broadhinny.

361
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,761
So she never received it.

362
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:46,642
But she did recognise a photograph
and that is most interesting.

363
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,759
Mademoiselle Horsfall,
I thank you very, very much indeed.

364
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,798
Pardon me, just one other thing,

365
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:56,443
this article that you wrote
on the individual cases, the tragic women,

366
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,478
is it accurate?

367
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:00,563
Accurate? Heck, who knows?

368
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,804
No. What I mean to say
is that the characters of your heroines

369
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,645
may not be quite as you represent them?

370
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:09,804
Look. It's romantic fiction for a Sunday paper.

well, I wouldn't let her anywhere near my cutlery.

374
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:23,677
Eva Kane went abroad, you know, to the New
World, to the Dominions, to start a new life.

375
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:27,402
And there is nothing to suggest is there,
Mademoiselle, that...

376
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:29,836
she did not return to this country?

377
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,525

My wife will want to know.

No. I seek fresh evidence in the McGinty case

385
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:27,324
and I understand that she was employed here.

386
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,962
Would you say
that she was a person who was truthful?

387
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,281
Truthful?

388
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,318
What do you mean, "truthful"?

389
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,200
I mean truthful in the way
most people mean truthful.

390
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,762
If she were to tell you something,
was she likely to be telling the truth?

391
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:44,356
Well, I really couldn't say.
You'd have to ask Mrs Scott the housekeeper.

- Yes, he consulted me once or twice.

Oh, he's a clever enough fellow, Robin.

405
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,924
Not quite as clever as he thinks he is, mind you.

406
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:44,724
And she, to my way of thinking, insulates him...

having skied the ten miles from the village.

- No, no, no.

431
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:59,043
But I've been writing books about him
for 30 years. He was at least 35...

432
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:01,601
Ariadne, darling, if he's 60,

433
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:05,765
then how can we have any sexual tension
between him and your young girl?

434
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:08,640
Your Ingrid?
That would just make him a dirty old man.

435
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,997
Well, then he can't be 60. He must be 35.

436

All the people who have read my books
know how old he is.

437

Ariadne, darling, I have explained this
several times now.

438
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:24,441
It's not a book, it's a play. We must have some
sexual tension between Sven and Ingrid.

439
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:28,526
You know how it is. They're antagonistic at first,
but secretly they like each other.

Oh, no, no, Ariadne,
you can't make him a pansy.

I mean, he's an outdoors sort of chap.

- He skis.
- He does not ski.

445
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,318
He's 60!

SPENCE: The date of execution
has been set for Monday fortnight.

507
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,759
Have you any ideas?

508
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,798
Anything at all?

509
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,478
Here are the photographs.

510
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:13,280
The ones the Sunday Comet used.

511
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,000
You'll never make an identification from them.

512
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:18,845
You recall the Craig case, Poirot?

513
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:22,596
Oui, d'accord.
Alfred Craig, the town clerk of Parminster.

514
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:25,719
And Eva Kane, 19 years of age.

515
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,836
She it is who falls in love with Craig.

516
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,878
And Craig with her.

517
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:37,358
And one day, the neighbours, they hear that
the wife has been ordered abroad for her health.

518
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:42,037
But... her health it declines and in time she dies.

519
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,885
But she does not die on the French Riviera.

520
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:46,883
Non.

521
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:48,997
She dies in the cellar in Parminster.

522
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:51,038
Poisoned.

523
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:55,000
Enfin, Craig, he is executed
and Eva Kane, who is expecting a child,

524
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:57,481
flees from the country.

525
00:33:57,527 --> 00:34:01,042
SPENCE: Yes, she went to Australia
and I can tell you the name she took.

526
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,884
It was Hope. Evelyn Hope.

527
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:07,596
Colleagues of mine think that Eva Kane
was a clever little actress.

528
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:10,241
That she did the murder
and Craig swung for it.

529
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,357
But if it is true...

530
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:16,366
- There's no evidence...
- No, but if it is true that Eva Kane is a killer,

531
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:19,046
then peut-etre she may kill again.

532
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,725
Then there's Lily Gamboll.

533
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,758
POIROT: Lily Gamboll.

534
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:27,198
She is rescued from a tenement that was
overcrowded in the East End of London.

535
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:30,762
She was placed
in the care of her aunt in the suburbs.

536
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,798
Wimbledon.

537
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:36,157
And one evening,
Lily Gamboll wished to go to the pictures,

538
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,198
but her aunt, she said, "Non."

539
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:42,957
So Lily Gamboll picks up the meat chopper from
the table, swings it at the head of her protector,

540
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,521
and because her aunt, she is weak and small...

541
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,637
the blow it killed her.

542
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,962
Lily Gamboll used a chopper on her aunt

543
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,443
and McGinty was dispatched
with a similar instrument.

544
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:57,799
If Mrs McGinty saw the photograph,
it was in one of her regular houses.

545
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,839
And if Eva Kane is still alive,

546
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:05,039
she must have more than 60 years
and her daughter would be in her 30s.

547
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:10,319
We have only met one person in Broadhinny

548
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,518
who has the right age to be Eva Kane.

549
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,797
And that is Madame Upward.

550
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:20,362
But she suffers from the arthritis,
she is confined to the wheelchair.

551
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,921
Also she does not have a daughter,
only a son.

552
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,435
Whom she adores.

553
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:28,762
But if Mrs Upward was Eva Kane,

554
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:33,323
mightn't her son kill Mrs McGinty
for the sake of his mother's reputation?

555
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:37,280
Non. I think he might use it
for publicity for one of his plays.

556
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:44,679
But there are three women who have
the right age to be the daughter of Eva Kane.

557
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:49,275
Shelagh Rendell, the wife of the doctor.

558
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,041
Maureen Summerhayes from Longmeadows.

559
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,123
And Eve Carpenter.

560
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,560
Let us first consider the daughter of Eva Kane.

561
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:08,720
Maureen Summerhayes, she does not strike me
as a "clever little actress",

562
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,759
even though she has been away
for many years in India.

563
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:18,285
Shelagh Rendell, she is afraid of something,
but of what I cannot discover.

564
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,318
But Eve Carpenter,

565
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:25,999
a woman who wears... what is the word,
maquillage... the make-up most expensive.

566
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,641
Married to a man with the ambitions political.

567
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,076
Who has a great sense of his own importance.

568
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:34,199
And there is also something else
about Eve Carpenter.

569
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:37,922
She is so vain
that she will not wear the spectacles

570
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:40,037
or only those that have a tint.

571
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:43,602
And without the spectacles,
she cannot even see to cross the room.

572
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:46,923
But, you know, from the point of view of age,

573
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,596
- any one of these three women could also be...
...Lily Gamboll.

574
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:55,004
At the time of the death of Mrs McGinty,
Madame Carpenter was not Madame Carpenter.

575
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,038
She was a young widow.

576
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,078
Very badly off.

577
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:01,118
Living in the cottage of a labourer.

578
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,523
Engaged to the rich man of the neighbourhood.

579
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:09,118
If only Guy Carpenter had discovered
he was about to marry a woman of low origin,

580
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,955
who had bludgeoned to death
her aunt with a meat chopper...

581
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,601
You do think it's Eve Carpenter, don't you?

582
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,280
I do not know.

583
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,959
Peut-etre she has the skeletons in the armoire.

584
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:29,997
Mais, certain, there must be some reason
that she tells to me that Mrs McGinty was a liar.

585
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,038
The whole thing is damned thin.

586
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:37,285
Does anyone really commit murder
for the reasons we've been considering?

587
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:38,919
Ah.

588
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,880
The passion for respectability,
it is very strong, Superintendent.

589
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,202
These are not artists or bohemians.

590
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:48,319
No, very nice people live in Broadhinny.

591
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,358
They tell to me so themselves.

592
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:54,845
(TYPING)

593
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:59,638
(PHONE RINGS)

594
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:08,525
I think that you do not originate from Kilchester.

595
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,046
No.

596
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,204
Moved here about a year ago.
I was in London before that.

597
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,238
Tired of it.

598
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:18,484
Tired of London?
May I ask what was your employment?

599
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,518
I worked in publicity.

600
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,762
And now you work for Breather & Scuttle?

601
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:24,798
I fancied a change.

602
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,759
But do you make progress,
that's what I want to know?

603
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:33,484
No, no. Mademoiselle, we do not have any suspects.
We do not have the murder weapon.

604
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,315
And we do not have any evidence
that James Bentley did not do it.

605
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:41,201
So to speak truly, non,
we do not make the progress.

606
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:44,717
But there are only two weeks
until they hang him.

607
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,758
(KEYS RATTLING)

608
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,402
(SQUEAKING)

609
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,481
Argh!

610
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,438
(SCREAMING)

611
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,558
Thank you. Thank you very much.

612
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:50,598
My pleasure.

613
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:01,004
Superintendent Spence, if you please.

614
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:04,119
Superintendent!
I have some very good news for you.

615
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,158
Non, non, non, non.

616
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:09,199
It is that someone has attempted to kill me.

617
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,238
(LAUGHTER FROM INSIDE)

618
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:18,998
(DISTORTED CONVERSATION)

619
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:28,166
(DISTORTED) The golfer turns to his caddy and
says, "Why do you keep looking at your watch?"

620
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:31,358
(DISTORTED CONVERSATION
AND LAUGHTER)

621
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:38,922
ARIADNE: It's him.

622
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,319
It's him.
I've had a look at everybody, and it's him.

623
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,720
It's always the doctor.

624
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,998
Thank you so much
for coming to my little soir?, Monsieur Poirot.

625
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:49,765
Madame.

626
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:53,595
I wish I could have found
some more intellectual company for you both.

627
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:55,956
- But...
- (BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER)

628
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:59,124
She's not as bad as she makes out,
in my opinion.

629
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:02,637
If only she'd make a little more effort,
she'd be up on her pins in no time.

630
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,678
She lets young Robin do everything.

631
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:07,995
I hear she gets about when she wants to.

632
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:16,560
You know, yesterday somebody
tried to push me under a train in Kilchester.

633
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,122
- Good gracious.
- I think they intended to kill me.

634
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:24,160
That Dr Rendell had a surgery in Kilchester
yesterday. So that settles it.

635
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:28,678
No, no, no, not quite. Monsieur and Madame
Carpenter, they were also there.

636
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:32,845
He was speaking at the meeting political.
She was doing... the shopping.

637
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:35,003
Major Summerhayes, he was there also.

638
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:38,441
Buying the pig feet.

639
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:44,642
Robin Upward's in the clear. He and I were
at work all day on that wretched dramatisation.

640
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:48,803
Now he wants Sven having sex in a sauna.

641
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,680
Sven's never had sex in his life.

642
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:54,446
You don't know how I suffer.

643
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,478
For I too suffer.

644
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:59,917
The cooking of Madame Summerhayes,
it is beyond description.

645
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:01,958
It is not cooking at all.

646
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:05,363
And the currents of the cold air,
the long hairs of the dogs,

647
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:08,922
the chairs, the terrible, terrible bed
in which I try to sleep.

648
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,958
And the coffee?

649
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:16,000
Words cannot describe to you
the fluid they serve to you as coffee.

650
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:19,005
I do like parties. Such lots of lovely gin.

651
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:22,562
And it's all thanks to you, Mrs Oliver.

652
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,679
I wish I could write books.
I can't do anything really.

653
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:29,640
There was a woman writing in the paper
the other day, the Sunday Comet.

654
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:34,602
A very, very silly woman. Horsfall or something.

655
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:40,119
She was asking whether it's better to let your
child be adopted and have every advantage -

656
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:46,037
every advantage - or whether you should
keep it, whatever your circs.

657
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:47,964
Idiot.

658
00:42:48,007 --> 00:42:51,204
I was adopted. I had every advantage.

659
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,442
It's always hurt.

660
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,719
Really sodding hurt.
To know that my mother didn't want me.

661
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:02,158
I was so cruelly abandoned.

662
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,324
Well..Just be thankful someone took you in, darling.
It's cold out there.

663
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:09,758
Well, I wouldn't give up my children,
if I had any...

664
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,798
for all the advantages in the world.

665
00:43:11,847 --> 00:43:14,725
- Come along, old girl.
- I feel so alone.

666
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:17,645
- (MIMICS) I feel so alone.
- Let's get you home, dear.

667
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:19,678
No.

668
00:43:21,327 --> 00:43:25,115
So er... Monsieur Poi... Poi... Poirot,

669
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:29,160
I suppose you have reason
for thinking James Bentley didn't do it.

670
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:32,995
- Oh, tell us, please.
- If he didn't kill her, who did?

671
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:36,084
- Haven't you got any clues, Poirot?
- That's it, clues.

672
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,517
Clues that mean everything to the detective
and nothing to you

673
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:43,162
- until at the end you kick yourself.
- I usually kick myself at the beginning.

674
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:48,076
Come on, Poirot, give us a glimpse
of the workings of your colossal brain.

(ALL CONCUR)

676
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:51,919
You wish for clues?

00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:00,484
- Voila
- (EXPRESSIONS OF SURPRISE)

678
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:04,602
- What frightful frumps.
- Who are they?

679
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:07,638
Who's that awful child?

680
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,404
My dear, that hat.

681
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,597
But why are they clues?

682
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:16,158
Who are they?

683
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:18,926
You do not recognise these photographs?

684
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:20,366
Recognise?

685
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:24,605
You do not, shall I say, remember having
seen one of these photographs before?

686
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:25,875
No.

687
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:27,360
Madame Carpenter?

688
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,685
Madame Rendell?

689
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:35,686
- Madame Rendell, you perhaps?
- Oh, I...

690
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:39,602
Ah, yes. Madame Upward.

691
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:43,639
You recognise one of these photographs,
do you not?

692
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:45,405
MRS UPWARD: Yes.

693
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,324
I think so.

694
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:52,645
Which one?

695
00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:01,085
So you have seen this photograph before?
When?

696
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,846
Oh, I can't...

697
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:05,525
Shh, Madre.

698
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,398
Quite recently.

699
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:10,881
I can't remember where.

700
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:16,365
But I'm sure I've seen that photograph before.

701
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,001
Mrs McGinty also recognised the photograph.

702
00:45:25,047 --> 00:45:27,038
And now Mrs McGinty, she is dead.

703
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:31,477
You must tell me anything you know, Madame.
Anything at all.

704
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:37,717
You are a woman who is secretive, Madame.

705
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:41,762
When I come to a decision,

706
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:43,798
I act.

707
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:47,886
Knowledge is power.
Power must only be used for the right ends.

708
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:53,756
You'll excuse my suggesting
that you don't perhaps appreciate...

709
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:58,077
...the pattern of our English country life.

710
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,318
In other words,

711
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:05,439
you say to me,
that you are only a damn foreigner, huh?

712
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,798
Be careful, Madame.

713
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:12,884
There is danger.

714
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:23,275
BESSIE: Where is it, Joe, where's the money?

715
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,397
Woman, mind your business, all right?

716
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:27,438
You're doing it again.

717
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:29,478
Just like before.

718
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:32,121
We don't pay rent now, so they can't kick us out.

719
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,078
We own the bloody place!

00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:52,765
I think I'll smoke.

00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,759
Good night.

Shh.

MAJOR SUMMERHAYES:
I've never been so humiliated.

727
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,561
You embarrassed me in public,
you stupid woman!

728
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,679
MRS SUMMERHAYES:
You embarrassed me! You lost all our money!

729
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:39,276
MAJOR: At least I had something to inherit
which is more than you did!

730
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:41,636
(SHE ARGUES BACK)
- For God's sake, shut up!

731
00:47:41,687 --> 00:47:44,679
MRS SUMMERHAYES:
Don't speak to me like that! I'll kill you!

732
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:46,479
I'll kill you with my own bare hands!

(PHONE RINGS)

734
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:58,116
It's the telephone for you.

735
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,725
Merci, Madame.

736
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:03,965
Madame! There is also
a new current of cold air in my room.

ARIADNE: I've got a another theory. Joe Burch.

739
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,958
Married to that niece of McGinty.

740
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:24,716
They had money troubles.
Joe fritters it. They can't pay the rent.

741
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:26,837
Joe leaves the cinema in Kilchester,

742
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:28,957
cycles the four miles to Broadhinny,

743
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,886
clobbers the old girl, then pedals back
just in time for the credits.

744
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:34,918
Then they inherit the cottage.

745
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:36,958
Got it? See you later.

746
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,677
MRS SUMMERHAYES: Here, boy! Come on!

747
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,241
Where have you got to? Come on!

748
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,358
S'il vous pla?, Madame.

749
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:00,198
What is this utensil?

750
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:03,045
- Oh, you've found that, have you?
- Oui.

751
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:06,397
It's a sugar cutter or sugar hammer
or something.

752
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:09,245
For chopping up sugar. It's rather fun, isn't it?

753
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:12,359
- Oh, my head.
- You brought it back perhaps from India?

754
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,398
Oh, no.

755
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:17,041
We bought this at the jumble sale at Christmas.

756
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,078
It came from Baghdad.

757
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,516
At least that's what Shelagh Rendell said.

758
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,683
In one of her more loquacious moments.

759
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:26,718
Merci, Madame.

(SHE WHISTLES FOR THE DOG)

761
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:32,206
Come on, boy.

762
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:52,675
A sugar hammer?

763
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:55,844
Oui, Madame, it is an instrument of brass
with a handle of wood.

764
00:49:55,887 --> 00:50:00,961
And there is on it a bird.
And there is also inlaid the stones blue and red.

765
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:02,963
Oh, yes.

766
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:04,565
Oh.

767
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,520
Madame?

768
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:10,558
Oh, um...

769
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,598
Yes, we bought it in a bazaar.

770
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,638
On holiday last year.

771
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:20,404
But it looked out of place,
so I took it to the jumble sale.

772
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:26,280
So you kept it here in this house until Christmas
and then you took it to the jumble sale?

773
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:30,206
No, it wasn't the Christmas sale,
it was the one before that, harvest festival.

774
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:32,363
The harvest festival? So when is that?

775
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:36,603
- September, October?
- It's the end of September.

776
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:41,926
Are you sure you took it
to the jumble sale in September

777
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:43,878
- and not at Christmas?
- Yes.

778
00:50:48,207 --> 00:50:52,519
Why... why are you really here in Broadhinny?

779
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:55,639
- To enquire into the death of Mrs McGinty.
- Nonsense.

780
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:59,680
It's absurd! No-one believes that for a moment.
She was a char.

781
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:04,043
I know what you're actually after.

782
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:05,964
And it's not true.

783
00:51:06,007 --> 00:51:08,157
None of it's true. He wouldn't.

784
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,004
- I just know he woul...
- Madame.

785
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:13,244
And you, you a professional!
A so-called professional.

786
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:16,404
I'd have thought it beneath your dignity
to come down here

787
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:19,325
and hound a man,
to harry him like a dog, like a beagle.

788
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,039
- It's the most...
- Madame.

789
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:24,159
Those letters were written by cowards.

790
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,084
Cowards and liars.

791
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:28,163
Traitors.

792
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:30,402
Filth.

793
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:32,438
Don't you believe a word!

794
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,038
Madame?

795
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:47,758
It is not glamorous, it is not fashionable.
It's cheap.

796
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:52,198
Sven Hjerson is a vegetarian.
Sven Hjerson has always been a vegetarian.

797
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:57,526
- He's got a little machine for chopping carrots.
- Yes, yes, Ariadne, precious, yes. But why?

798
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,798
I don't know.
Why, the thought of the revolting man!

799
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:03,520
I must have been mad.
These things just happen.

800
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:07,082
You try something and people seem to like it,
and then you go on,

801
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,118
and before you know where you are,

802
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,285
you've got someone like
that maddening Sven Hjerson tied to you for life.

803
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:17,286
Shouldn't you spend some time on casting,
Robin?

804
00:52:17,327 --> 00:52:20,763
- Hm?
- Didn't you think Cecil Leech was a good idea?

805
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:24,277
Oh, that is very shrewd, Madre.

806
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:27,239
You know, Cecil Leech could do it.

807
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:29,278
Now...

808
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,887
Why don't we motor over to Kilchester tonight?

809
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:35,317
He's in my touring production at the rep.

810
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:41,638
To London, if you please. Express.

811
00:52:41,687 --> 00:52:43,678
- Ooh, Scotland Yard.
- Oui.

812
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,126
Fancy.

813
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:49,240
Mademoiselle Sweetiman, from your accent,
I suspect you are not from these parts.

814
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,278
No, I'm a blow-in.

815
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,921
May I ask where the wind,
it has blown you from?

816
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:55,958
I grew up abroad.

817
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,998
Never mind where.

818
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:01,038
Hello, Joe.

819
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:03,078
Monsieur.

820
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:15,605
Oh, Madre, I'm so sorry, I just don't want you
to feel lonely. We can cancel it.

821
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,639
You'll do no such thing.
Go out and have a lovely time.

822
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:20,678
You'll enjoy it, Mrs Oliver.

823
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:23,116
If I'm lonely,

824
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,727
I'll ring up one of the neighbours.

825
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,281
- Well, if you're sure.
- Of course, I'm sure.

826
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:30,602
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

827
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:35,518
Oh, damn, hang on a minute.

828
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,558
Sorry, darling.

829
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,598
Almost forgot your coffee.

830
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:44,764
Now, are you sure
you're going to be all right, precious?

831
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:46,798
I'll be fine.

832
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:04,077
I've something for you.
Something that might help the investigation.

833
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:09,804
Mrs Carpenter, Eve Carpenter, used to be
an exotic dancer at The Cactus Club in Soho.

834
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,838
How do you know this?

835
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:14,878
I've been scouting around.

836
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,724
And?

837
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:20,237
She's still got the publicity stills.
Pretty audacious, actually.

838
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:23,597
Mademoiselle, are you telling to me
that you have broken and entered?

839
00:54:23,647 --> 00:54:25,638
Certainly not!

840
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:30,158
I was conducting a survey
for the Estate Agents Guild.

841
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:34,803
I simply asked the burghers of Broadhinny
if I might peep inside their lovely homes.

842
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:37,964
They invariably give me a tour.

843
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:42,801
I also noticed something at Dr Rendell's house.
His wife was...

844
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,838
Dinner!

845
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:55,636
Well, that was incredibly well received,
wasn't it?

846
00:54:55,687 --> 00:55:00,807
I think that Cecil is going to be just perfect for us.

847
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:02,838
Look, let me sign your programme.

848
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:04,878
Oh, so kind of you.

849
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,918
- A pleasure.
- Thank you.

850
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,958
- There you are.
- Marvellous.

851
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:11,282
- I'll just put the car away.
- Jolly good.

852
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:14,518
We're home, Mrs Upward.

853
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:18,198
It was terribly sad.

854
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:21,477
But he's ever so talented, I suppose.

855
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,518
Well, I'm going to bed.

856
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:33,478
Mrs Upward?

857
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,405
Mrs Upward?

(GASPS)

859
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:53,086
Neat, quick, efficient.
The Thuggees did it that way in India.

860
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:55,118
Victim doesn't cry out or struggle.

861
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:58,398
Pressure on the carotid artery.

862
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:00,438
I'd wager it was someone she knew.

863
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,478
They had a coffee together.

864
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:05,837
There are no prints on the cup,
but there's lipstick, look.

865
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,482
And there was a strong smell of scent.
A very expensive scent.

866
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:12,644
You say Mrs Upward
recognised one of your photographs?

867
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:15,678
So many think of murder as a game.

868
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:19,037
It is not a game. I told this to her,
but she would not listen.

869
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:25,398
There's a woman outside to see you.
Mrs Summerhayes. She says it's important.

870
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:33,044
Come in, Mrs Summerhayes.
I think you know these people.

871
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:34,805
Yes.

872
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:37,838
So...

873
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:41,880
MRS SUMMERHAYES: I was here last night.

874
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:43,838
SPENCE: At what time?

875
00:56:43,887 --> 00:56:45,878
I don't know.

876
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:48,316
She telephoned me. She was lonely.

877
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,398
She spoke to Johnny actually.

879
00:56:53,487 --> 00:56:54,556
Hello.

880
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:56,598
Come and have coffee, she said.

881
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,605
Well, Johnny was working as usual.

882
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,320
And their coffee is a lot better than ours, so...

883
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:05,484
- So you had coffee with her?
- I rang the bell.

884
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,518
Mrs Upward! Hello.

885
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,558
But nobody answered.

886
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:13,486
I called out, but there was no answer.

887
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:18,484
You've hit the bull's-eye
with that sugar hammer thing.

888
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:21,564
People don't realise
that even a microscopic amount of blood

889
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:23,723
will show up under analysis nowadays.

890
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,042
And it fits the head wound rather snugly.

891
00:57:27,087 --> 00:57:30,363

893
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:37,280
It has some illustrations that are splendid,
but please to take a look at the flyleaf.

894
00:57:40,007 --> 00:57:43,238
- Evelyn Hope.
- Eva Kane.

895
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:45,243
But how did you...

896
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,757
The Great Barrier Reef, mon ami,
it is situated where?

897
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:50,479
Australia.

898
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,998
Mrs Upward.

899
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:00,795
You have not told to me, Madame,
about your visit to Kilchester.

900
00:58:00,847 --> 00:58:04,726
It was like going to see his family.
He's more at home in the theatre than at home.

901
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:09,158
And yet he has feelings so strong for his mother.
And cares for her so diligently.

902
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:11,926
So perhaps he made to her
a telephone call that evening.

903
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:14,401
- To his mother? Oh, yes, absolutely.
- Indeed. At what time?

904
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:17,200
About 7:15, I suppose.
Just before we got to the theatre.

905
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:19,363
And how was Madame Upward?

906
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:21,398
She was fine.

907
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:24,200
You know, it's not very nice to discover a body.

908
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:26,238
Non.

909
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:29,359
I shall have to write
a lot less screaming in future.

What friends?

916
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:56,317
- Maude Williams.
- What's it got to do with her?

917
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,483
She's convinced that you are not guilty.

918
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:05,158
Ma foi! Is it a crime to like a pretty girl?

919
00:59:05,207 --> 00:59:07,846
Tell to me.

920
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:11,355
We went for a walk together once.

921
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:14,198
It was nice.

922
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,358
She's nice.

923
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:19,965
I liked her hair.

924
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,961
She had lovely dark hair.

925
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:26,157
And her clothes.

926
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:29,324
Mother's were old-fashioned,
but hers were nice.

927
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,924
And she's kind.

928
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:36,846
- So she came to Broadhinny?
- Yes, on estate agent business.

929
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:40,482
And you what, you took her
to the pictures or perhaps a meal?

930
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,124
No.

931
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:44,919
No, sir, I didn't have any money.

932
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:47,958
We just walked.

933
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:52,044
- Bumped into that writer chap.
- Mr Upward.

934
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,362
Maude said
I should talk to him about my poems.

935
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:56,398
- Your poems?
- Yeah.

936
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:59,438
I write these little poems.

937
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:04,559
She asked for his autograph.
She said he was famous.

938

- Robin Upward.
- That's him, yeah.

939
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:13,285

if I stick at it.

before Mrs McGinty was killed?

I wish to ask you something else,
Monsieur Bentley.

943
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,759
Mrs McGinty, she took the Sunday Comet?

944
01:00:25,807 --> 01:00:28,321
- That's right.
- Did you ever read her Sunday Comet?

945
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:30,119
No. I...

946
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,078
I was brought up to believe it was trash.

947
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,403
- So you did not see it that week?
- No.

948
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:39,326
And Mrs McGinty, did she speak
of anything that she read that Sunday?

949
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:43,837
She did, yeah. Yeah, she was full of it.
She went on and on.

950
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:47,482
All right, now, this is very important,
so please to be careful.

951
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:49,757
What did she say?

952
01:00:53,727 --> 01:00:56,560
It was about some ancient murder case.

953
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,878

954
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:01,406

955
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:03,438
No, I can't recall.

956
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:07,275
She said someone connected with it
is living in Broadhinny now.

957
01:01:07,327 --> 01:01:09,318
- Did she say who?
- Well...

958
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:11,835
It was his mother, wasn't it?

959
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:13,286
Whose?

960
01:01:13,327 --> 01:01:16,319
The chap we were just talking about.
The writer chap.

961
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:17,846
Madame Upward?

962
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,718
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

963
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,758
Or was it someone else?

964
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:24,963
I wasn't really listening to her.

965
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:29,597
It is disheartening to reflect, Monsieur,
that if you are hanged,

966
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:34,163
it is because you do not pay the proper attention
to the people with whom you converse!

967
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,846
I... I don't want to be hanged, sir.

968
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:38,605
I haven't done anything.

969
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:41,478
It's my mind, it wanders, all right?

970
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:44,246

Please.

972
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:54,317
Why, Superintendent, should a woman keep
a photograph of herself when she is young?

973
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:55,561
Vanity.

974
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:56,926
Oui.

975
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:01,164
She has been a pretty girl,
so she keeps a photograph of herself

976
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:03,482
to remind her what a pretty girl she used to be,

977
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:06,724
when the mirror, it says to her
things most distressing.

978
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:09,837
If Eve Carpenter or Shelagh Rendell,

979
01:02:09,887 --> 01:02:11,878
both women who are most attractive,

980
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,918
had a photograph such as this,

981
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:18,438
they would tear it into pieces very quickly
for fear someone should see it. Non.

982
01:02:18,487 --> 01:02:21,160
Your reason of vanity we may discount.

983
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:24,878
Let us take another reason.

984
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:28,360
Sentiment. The memory of someone you love.

985
01:02:30,527 --> 01:02:34,566
Did anybody love Lily Gamboll at that age?

986
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:40,283
Surely the whole point about Lily Gamboll
is that she was a child that was not loved.

987
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:42,318
This child of the slums.

988
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:45,677
So I conclude it was not sentiment either.

989
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:49,845
Look here, Poirot, what you're saying is
that nobody would have kept that photo?

990
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:51,843
Exactement, mon ami.

991
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,799
But someone did.
Mrs Upward admitted she'd seen it.

992
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:57,680
- But had she?
- Dash it all, Poirot, you said she had.

993
01:02:57,727 --> 01:02:59,604
Yes, but I believe that she was lying.

994
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:03,196
She knows the photograph, yes,
but she pointed to the other one.

995
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,078
For to create a screen of smoke.

996
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:07,482
Why? Was she being blackmailed?

997
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:10,758
- She was a wealthy woman.
- Madame Upward had seen something.

998
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:14,277
She intends contacting the person concerned
at the first opportunity.

999
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:17,797
And the first opportunity was
when Robin Upward went to the theatre.

And you have met him

1017
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,358
I was just having a little break.

1018
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:08,875
Well, I must persist.

1019
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:12,078
I feel it's what poor old Madre
would have wanted.

1020
01:05:12,127 --> 01:05:14,800
By the way, I hope my typing
is not too noisy for you.

1021
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,838
- Pardon?
- My typing!

1022
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:19,003
- I hope it's not too noisy.
- Non, non.

1023
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:21,925
It's just I can't stay at Laburnums on my own.

1024
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:26,398
Where is it?

1025
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:30,398
What is it you look for, Madame?

1026
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:33,644
It's the Ministry of Agriculture form
about the bloody pig.

1027
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:35,678
Got it.

1028
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,198
(TYPING)

1029
01:05:55,807 --> 01:05:57,798
Madame Rendell.

1030
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:03,798
S'il vous plait, Madame.

1031
01:06:03,847 --> 01:06:05,838
May I ask of you something?

1032
01:06:05,887 --> 01:06:08,959
Did Madame Upward telephone to you
on the day of her death?

1033
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,599
Yeah.

1034
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:12,638
At what time?

1035
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:16,316
Mrs Scott, the housekeeper, took the message.

1036
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,358
Ask her.

1037
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:22,605
And what was the message? Was it perhaps
to ask you to go there that evening?

1038
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:24,638
Yes.

1039
01:06:24,687 --> 01:06:26,678
But I'm ashamed to say, I...

1040
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:31,395
I took my medication
and I fell asleep after dinner.

1041
01:06:31,447 --> 01:06:33,039
Um...

1042
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,282
When I woke, it was too late.

1043
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:37,318
It was dark.

1044
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,358
I should have gone.

1045
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:43,206
Merci, Madame.

1046
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:55,402
Doesn't this take the pressure off James?
He can't have killed Mrs Upward. He's in prison.

1047
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,002
What is it that you want, Mademoiselle?

1048
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:05,326
I believe in James Bentley.

1049
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:10,725
He's a troubled soul, but I believe he can do
great things. I want to clear his name.

1050
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:14,884
Tell to me what you discovered
at the house of Dr Rendell.

1051
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:21,036
On reflection, it may have been nothing,
but... his wife was burning letters.

1052
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:25,558
There was a pile of letters
in the grate in her sitting room, still smouldering.

1053
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,598
Now, what might she be up to?

1054
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,320
She hardly looks the type to be having an affair.

1055
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:36,322
Does the name Evelyn Hope
mean anything to you?

1056
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:38,358
Evelyn Hope?

1057
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:40,401
I see you know the name.

1058
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:42,039
Yes.

1059
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:45,762
It was the name Eva what's-her-name took
when she went to Australia.

1060
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:47,877
It was in that paper, the Sunday Comet.

1061
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,999
The Sunday Comet said many things.
It did not say that.

1062
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:55,165
Evelyn Hope is a name that I discovered
in a book at the house of Madame Upward.

1063
01:07:55,207 --> 01:07:56,526
What?

1064
01:07:56,567 --> 01:07:59,286
Why did you want
the autograph of Robin Upward?

1065
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:02,205
Why did you come to this part of the world
in the first place?

1066
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:05,920
How do you know Eva Kane went to Australia?

1067
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:09,435
Sorry. I've got to go.

1068
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:12,763
- Where to, Mademoiselle?
- I've got to go, I'm sorry.

1069
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:15,844
- Goodbye.
- Mademoiselle.

1070
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:28,439
I'll pay you whatever you want.
You're a private investigator, aren't you?

1071
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:30,478
I'll pay you whatever you ask.

1072
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:32,518
Get the police off my back.

1073
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:36,116
- They think I killed the Upward woman.
- And did you, Madame?

1074
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:39,762
No, I was at home listening to the radio.
Guy was at a meeting.

1075
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:45,039
Croft took the message from Mrs Upward
asking me to go down and see her.

1076
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,476
- Did you go?
- Why the hell should I?

1077
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:49,757
Damn, dreary old woman.

1078
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:52,765
Thought she was a bloody movie star.

1079
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:57,842
Why do you not wear your spectacles,
Madame?

1080
01:08:57,887 --> 01:08:59,559
Oh, I do sometimes.

1081
01:08:59,607 --> 01:09:01,279
I had to as a child.

1082
01:09:02,327 --> 01:09:05,637
- Also the plate for the teeth?
- Yes.

1083
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,678
I was a sad little thing.

1084
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,116
I'm sure your mother, she did not think so.

1085
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:13,000
I couldn't tell you. She left pretty sharpish.

1086
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:16,119
What the hell are we talking about, anyway?
Will you take the job?

1087
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:18,601
Je regrette que non, Madame.

1088
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:22,796
A question of money, is it?

1089
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:25,281
How much?

1090
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,318
That is your great mistake, Madame.

1091
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:31,155
To think always in terms
of the question of money.

1092
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:34,801
Ooh, scissors.

1093
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:20,761
SPENCE: I've been making enquiries in Dublin.

1094
01:10:20,807 --> 01:10:22,798
There's a woman called Lily Brogan

1095
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:27,159
serving life in Mountjoy Gaol for chopping up
her spouse with a meat cleaver.

1096
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,198
She's the right age.

1097
01:10:29,247 --> 01:10:31,044
She wears thick glasses.

1098
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:33,078
Has a vile temper.

1099
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:36,199
And is said to have
originally come from Wimbledon.

1100
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:38,761
Hardly conclusive.

1101
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:41,116
Fixed.

1102
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:43,681
So, this woman in Dublin,
she could be Lily Gamboll?

1103
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:46,287
Yes. Which leaves us with Evelyn Hope.

1104
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:48,363
Formerly Eva Kane.

1105
01:10:48,407 --> 01:10:50,875
Who reportedly died in Australia 20 years ago.

1106
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:54,522
Eva Kane was the governess to the Craig family,
n'est-ce pas?

1107
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:55,602
Yes.

1108
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:59,720
And where there is a governess,
il y a des enfants. Were there children?

1109
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:04,397
Yes, two. They went to live
with relatives when the mother was killed.

1110
01:11:06,807 --> 01:11:08,798
Wait one little minute.

1111
01:11:10,327 --> 01:11:12,477
Confirm for me this, mon cher Spence.

1112
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:16,564
Eva Kane leaves the country
before Craig is executed. Right?

1113
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:17,801
Yes.

1114
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:21,442
- And at this time she is expecting a child?
- Yes, like it said in the paper.

1115
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,478
Mon Dieu.

1116
01:11:23,527 --> 01:11:25,518
How stupid is Poirot!

1117
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:31,483
Do you know, mon ami,
what is a secret de Polichinelle?

1118
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:33,882
I don't speak foreign, Poirot.

1119
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:37,363
Ah. Then quickly, Superintendent, into the car!
Vite!

1120
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:51,243
Mesdames et Messieurs,

1121
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:56,516
I will not make for you the history
that is long and complicated.

1122
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:01,765
But it is necessary
that I should start at the very beginning.

1123
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:05,446
Mrs Abigail McGinty.

1124
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,759
A woman who is simple, hardworking,

1125
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:14,436
down on her knees scrubbing your floors.

1126
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:19,004
Alas, Mrs McGinty, she is killed.

1127
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:24,041
And a young man, James Bentley,
he is tried and convicted.

1128
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:28,000
But my dear friend Superintendent Spence
from Scotland Yard

1129
01:12:28,047 --> 01:12:31,642
had doubts that Bentley was truly guilty.

1130
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:33,678
And so he approached me,

1131
01:12:33,727 --> 01:12:35,718
Hercule Poirot,

1132
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:39,679
to confirm his suspicions or not...

1133
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:41,718
as the case may be.

1134
01:12:42,687 --> 01:12:45,759
And so the first question for Poirot to ask,
it is this.

1135
01:12:45,807 --> 01:12:48,196
Why did Mrs McGinty die?

1136
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:56,127
By now you know about the photograph
that was published in the Sunday Comet.

1137
01:12:56,167 --> 01:13:00,718
Mrs McGinty has recognised
one of those photographs.

1138
01:13:03,607 --> 01:13:06,201
In fact, James Bentley told me so himself

1139
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:09,603
that she saw this photograph
at the house of Madame Upward.

1140
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:14,118
But when I produced my two photographs
at her house that night,

1141
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:21,198
Madame Upward pointed to the photograph
of the child killer

1142
01:13:21,247 --> 01:13:23,238
Lily Gamboll.

1143
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:28,246
But Madame Upward pointed to
the wrong photograph quite deliberately.

1144
01:13:28,287 --> 01:13:30,005
To shake me from the scent.

1145
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:34,398
But one person was not deceived.

1146
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,038
The murderer.

1147
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:44,641
And here I will not beat around the shrubbery.

1148
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:48,236
The photograph that Madame Upward
recognised was the other one.

1149
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:53,917
That of Eva Kane,
the accomplice in the Craig murder case.

1150
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:57,084
And the following evening,
Madame Upward, she is killed.

1151
01:13:57,127 --> 01:13:59,357
(CHOKING)

1152
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:02,240
But before she died,

1153
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:04,517
three women received a telephone call.

1154
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:06,717
(PHONE RINGS)

1155
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:10,043
Madame Eve Carpenter,
Madame Shelagh Rendell,

1156
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:12,838
Madame Maureen Summerhayes.

1157
01:14:12,887 --> 01:14:15,640
We must now look to them.

1158
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:21,441
Madame Upward made this call herself,

1159
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:26,236
asking each of these women
to come and see her that evening.

1160
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:29,757
Now...Had these women anything in common?
Nothing it would seem except their age.

1161
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:32,401
Each has the right age

1162
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:35,439
to be the daughter of Eva Kane.

1163
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:40,596
But when these summonses were received,
what actually occurred?

1164
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:44,075
Madame Summerhayes went to the Laburnums.

1165
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:46,118
Mrs Upward!

1166
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:48,681
She could not make herself heard
and so she departed.

1167
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:53,243
Madame Carpenter and Madame Rendell
for different reasons, they did not go.

1168
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:55,278
And yet...

1169
01:14:55,327 --> 01:14:58,080
there were traces of lipstick
on the cup on the table.

1170
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:05,879
There is also another witness...
who shall remain incognito,

1171
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:08,919
who saw a woman walking up to Laburnums.

1172
01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:22,922
Et aussi we have the evidence of a scent.

1173
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:24,958
A scent that is strong,

1174
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:26,998
exotique, expensive.

1175
01:15:28,407 --> 01:15:30,398
And exactly the same...

1176
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:35,921
...as is used by you, Madame Carpenter.

1177
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:39,322
I never went near the place. Guy, do something.

1178
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:43,440
We already know certain things about your
wife's past, things she'd rather keep hidden.

1179
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,682
- You bastard!
- Perhaps she has further secrets.

1180
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:49,242
Let me inform you, Poirot,
we have laws of slander in this country.

1181
01:15:49,287 --> 01:15:53,075
Is it a slander to say that your wife
wears a certain lipstick or perfume?

1182
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:55,925
You utter bastard! This is ridiculous.

1183
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:59,846
- Anyone can go splashing my perfume about.
- Exactement.

1184
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:03,516
Anyone could and someone did.

1185
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,202
Clumsy and crude.

1186
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:10,238
But it made me to think,

1187
01:16:10,287 --> 01:16:13,996
scent, lipstick on a cup.

1188
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:18,757
But surely lipstick can be removed very easily,
every trace, but it was not. Why not?

1189
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:23,835
And it seemed to me that there was
an emphasis most deliberate on femininity.

1190
01:16:23,887 --> 01:16:27,482
An underlining of the fact that it was
a woman who committed the murder.

1191
01:16:27,527 --> 01:16:30,997
And so Poirot, of course, he begins
to suspect that it was not.

1192
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:35,359
The telephone calls that these women received,
they were only messages.

1193
01:16:35,407 --> 01:16:37,875
None of them spoke to Madame Upward herself.

1194
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:42,323
She communicated with Monsieur Croft,
your butler.

1195
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:46,680
Madame Scott, your housekeeper.

1196
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,160
Hmm.

1197
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:50,198
And, of course,

1198
01:16:50,247 --> 01:16:52,044
with you, sir.

1199
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:54,999
Major Summerhayes.
What did she say to you, in fact?

1200
01:16:56,047 --> 01:16:57,560
Hello.

1201
01:16:57,607 --> 01:17:00,440
She said, ask Maureen to pop round for coffee,
if you would.

1202
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:03,320
- Just so?
- Just so. What are you implying?

1203
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:07,758
No, no, nothing, Monsieur. Did she sound
to you normal? Or was she under any stress?

1204
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:10,116
Well, I wasn't really listening, damn it.

1205
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:15,285
I put the receiver down and called for my wife.
I was hard at work on my book.

1206
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:20,957
Well, I suppose her voice sounded strained.
Do you think someone forced her to do it?

1207
01:17:21,007 --> 01:17:24,602
I only know, Monsieur, that someone
was most anxious to involve a woman.

1208
01:17:24,647 --> 01:17:28,322
Any woman. I asked myself, why?

1209
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:32,406
And the only answer
it seemed to me could be this.

1210
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:36,326
That it was not a woman
who killed Madame Upward, but a man.

1211
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:39,564
And so we arrive to here,
a man killed Madame Upward.

1212
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:41,757
And from the evidence that we now have,

1213
01:17:41,807 --> 01:17:46,835
it is conclusive
that this same man killed Mrs McGinty.

1214
01:17:49,887 --> 01:17:51,878
What kind of man?

1215
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,438
A man they knew?

1216
01:17:56,487 --> 01:17:58,557
A man to whom they would open the door?

1217
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:02,680
A man who would, how do you say,
pop around by foot?

1218
01:18:03,807 --> 01:18:05,604
By car?

1219
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,000
By bicycle?

1220
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:12,123
Both of these murders hinge on a photograph.

1221
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,840
And after the second murder...

1222
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:18,283
I'm sure you'll all agree with me

1223
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:22,320
that the very presence of this photograph
for the murderer, it is very dangerous.

1224
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:24,961
It should be destroyed, eh? But it was not.

1225
01:18:25,887 --> 01:18:27,684
How do I know this?

1226
01:18:27,727 --> 01:18:33,359
I discovered this photograph
only yesterday in a drawer in this room.

1227
01:18:38,367 --> 01:18:39,959
Eva Kane.

1228
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,958
And on the reverse...

1229
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:51,320
"My mother."

1230
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,921
I don't understand, I never saw th...

1231
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:02,199
You told to us that you were adopted.
You never knew your parents, but someone did.

1232
01:19:02,247 --> 01:19:04,636
Someone knew, someone discovered.

1233
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:08,077
Someone has all the ancestral pride
of the family

1234
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:12,006
and someone who rather than let the world
know his wife was the daughter of Eva Kane,

1235
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,720
would rather die or in this case, would rather kill!

1236
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:18,476
Now, look here, you filthy swine,
I've just about had enough.

1237
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,802
Anyone can put a photo in a drawer!

1238
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:22,485
You're quite potty.

1239
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:26,156
I've never seen that picture before in my life.
Except at the Upwards... at the night.

1240
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,562
Who's that awful child?

1241
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:32,797
You're fortunate that Poirot
knows he is telling the truth.

1242
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:38,445
Because this photograph was only placed in
the drawer only a little while before I found it.

1243
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:42,082
How do I know this? Because I replaced
the contents of this drawer earlier.

1244
01:19:42,127 --> 01:19:46,245
And it was not there then. So it must have
been placed there during that interval.

1245
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:48,357
And so...

1246
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:51,604
both crimes were committed by a man.

1247
01:19:51,647 --> 01:19:55,003
And for the simplest of reasons.

1248
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:57,038
Money.

1249
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:01,683
In a flyleaf of a book
that I discovered at Madame Upward's

1250
01:20:01,727 --> 01:20:03,718
is the name written "Evelyn Hope".

1251
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:09,841
Now, Hope was the name given to Eva Kane
when she left England to go to Australia.

1252
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:11,878
But if her real name was Evelyn,

1253
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:15,840
then it is quite natural to suspect
that she would give this name to her child.

1254
01:20:15,887 --> 01:20:19,482
After all, Evelyn is a name that can be given
to a man as well as to a woman.

1255
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:22,724
But why did we suspect
that the child of Eva Kane was a girl?

1256
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:26,203
Because the Sunday Comet, it told us so.

1257
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:29,444
In an article written
by Mademoiselle Pamela Horsfall.

1258
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,876
But, mes amis, this article was a work of fiction.

1259
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:36,125
How could Pamela Horsfall possibly know
the sex of a child that was unborn?

1260
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:39,000
Accurate? Heck, who knows?

1261
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,038
Non!

1262
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:44,478
Evelyn Hope...

1263
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:47,518
...was the son...

1264
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:49,558
of Eva Kane.

1265
01:20:51,007 --> 01:20:53,441
He left Australia, came to England, found work.

1266
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:56,763
He attracts the attention
of a widow who is rich, lonely.

1267
01:20:56,807 --> 01:20:59,844
And little by little, she grows to adore him.

1268
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:03,926
He changes his name to hers by deed poll
and they come to Broadhinny.

1269
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:07,721
But your real name, Monsieur,

1270
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:10,718
it is Evelyn Hope.

1271
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:14,238
N'est-ce pas?

1272
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:20,525
What are you talking about?

1273
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:26,483
The name "Evelyn Hope" that I discovered
in the flyleaf of the book is in your handwriting.

1274
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:28,119
As are the words...

1275
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,158
..."My mother"...

1276
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:34,882
...on the back of this photograph.

1277
01:21:34,927 --> 01:21:39,443
And it was this photograph that Mrs McGinty
found when she was tidying your room.

1278
01:21:39,487 --> 01:21:44,845
She assumed that it was the photograph
of Laura Upward when she was young.

1279
01:21:46,487 --> 01:21:51,322
She could have no idea
that Madame Upward was not your real mother.

1280
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:54,882
But your real mother, Monsieur,
it was Eva Kane!

1281
01:21:55,807 --> 01:22:00,403
And you know that if your Madre, she knows,
she would throw you out, out on your own,

1282
01:22:00,447 --> 01:22:02,438
to fend for yourself.

1283
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:08,523
It is not easy to make a living as a playwright
without the help of a generous banker.

1284
01:22:09,727 --> 01:22:13,800
So Mrs McGinty, she is silenced.

1285
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,838
You ridiculous little man.

1286
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:18,765
Where do you get these absurd ideas from?

1287
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:21,196
Ah, I will tell it to you. From the beginning,

1288
01:22:21,247 --> 01:22:24,045
I thought there was something unnatural
at the Laburnums.

1289
01:22:24,087 --> 01:22:27,966
Your attitude to Laura Upward,
it was not the attitude of a son to a mother.

1290
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:32,319
It was rather the attitude
of a prot??to a patron.

1291
01:22:32,367 --> 01:22:37,157
And Laura Upward, even though she adores
you, she treats you as an object of luxury,

1292
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,198
for which she has bought and paid.

1293
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,238
But all goes well, eh?

1294
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:42,925
For Robin Upward.

1295
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:46,606
Soudainement he is the successful playwright.

1296
01:22:47,607 --> 01:22:51,725
Until comes along... the McGinty.

1297
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:56,322
What are you to do? You steal
the sugar hammer from the Summerhayes.

1298
01:22:57,567 --> 01:23:00,286
You can steal anything from the Summerhayes.

1299
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:02,682
You drive your car to her cottage.

1300
01:23:03,727 --> 01:23:07,879
Mrs McGinty, she is expecting...
le petit cadeau, eh?

1301
01:23:08,847 --> 01:23:10,644
A little present.

1302
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:12,837
Perhaps even the pay-off.

1303
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:18,124
Instead you smash in her skull.

1304
01:23:20,727 --> 01:23:22,922
Next you fake a burglary.

1305
01:23:26,607 --> 01:23:29,963
You mean Monsieur James Bentley
to be fingered.

1306
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:35,558
You met him only a few days before.
You found him to be a man of little intelligence.

1307
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:39,122
So he will discover the body,
he will panic, he will incriminate himself.

1308
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:41,158
Et voil? he does.

1309
01:23:41,207 --> 01:23:44,483
He is tried and convicted.

1310
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:46,518
And all goes well...

1311
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:51,124
...until I produce my two photographs
at the house that night.

1312
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,518
And at that very moment,

1313
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:57,127
you know that your mother, she knows.

1314
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:04,401
And so you prepare your mise-en-sc?e.

1315
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:08,804
Damn, hang on a minute.

1316
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:11,361
You leave Madame Oliver sitting in the car.

1317
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:13,398
Almost forgot your coffee.

1318
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:17,076
Now, are you sure
you're going to be all right, precious?

1319
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:19,118
I'll be fine.

1320
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:33,158
And you kill her.

1321
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:39,565
And the murder, it takes... a matter of seconds.

1322
01:24:41,607 --> 01:24:44,963
And now to make it look as though
a woman committed the crime,

1323
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:49,319
you smear the cup with lipstick, lipstick you had
taken from the handbag of Madame Carpenter.

1324
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:53,201
You even brought along a bottle of her scent
most favourite.

1325
01:24:54,527 --> 01:24:57,405
Now for the final act of incriminating a woman,

1326
01:24:59,407 --> 01:25:04,481
you make a telephone call... to your mother.

1327
01:25:04,527 --> 01:25:07,041
On your way to the theatre with Madame Oliver.

1328
01:25:07,847 --> 01:25:10,361
From Kilchester. Is that not right, Monsieur?

1329
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:11,999
Yes!

1330
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:14,242
Yes, I did, and she was fine.

1331
01:25:14,287 --> 01:25:17,040
Now, that is enough!

1332
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:24,479
I shall certainly
be contacting my lawyers immediately.

1333
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:27,564
This lawyer had better be an expert, Monsieur!

1334
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:31,121
Because you did not telephone to your mother.

1335
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,443
Because at that time,
Laura Upward, she was already dead.

1336
01:25:34,487 --> 01:25:36,603
You made the telephone call to three women.

1337
01:25:36,647 --> 01:25:40,765
Madame Eve Carpenter, Madame Shelagh
Rendell and Madame Maureen Summerhayes.

1338
01:25:42,007 --> 01:25:44,919
You employed
all the skills of the actor that you once were.

1339
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:47,720
(FEMALE VOICE) Hello. This is Laura Upward.

1340
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:50,804
I wonder, would you please give
Mrs Rendell a message?

1341
01:25:50,847 --> 01:25:56,160
And now you wanted to place any one
of these three women at the scene of the crime.

1342
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:59,802
And once you had discovered that
Maureen Summerhayes, she had been there,

1343
01:25:59,847 --> 01:26:01,963
it was then that you conceived the idea

1344
01:26:02,007 --> 01:26:04,680
of placing this photograph
amongst her possessions.

1345
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:06,797
After all, the sugar hammer was hers.

1346
01:26:06,847 --> 01:26:10,556
And because she had been adopted,
she would find it very difficult

1347
01:26:10,607 --> 01:26:14,202
to prove that she was not the child of Eva Kane.

1348
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:21,556
But you forgot to observe one little fact,
Monsieur.

1349
01:26:23,207 --> 01:26:28,281
The fact that Madame Maureen Summerhayes
never at any time wears the lipstick.

1350
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:32,398
Is that not so, Madame?

1351
01:26:32,447 --> 01:26:34,085
No.

1352
01:26:34,127 --> 01:26:35,765
I never wear lipstick.

1353
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:37,798
Non.

1354
01:26:38,847 --> 01:26:40,838
See, Monsieur,

1355
01:26:40,887 --> 01:26:43,321
when I tidied the drawer,

1356
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:47,485
I knew that the person
who had placed this photograph there...

1357
01:26:48,527 --> 01:26:50,518
...was typing above my head.

1358
01:26:51,327 --> 01:26:54,717
And then I remembered
what you said to Maureen Summerhayes,

1359
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:57,235
when she admitted to being adopted,
that night.

1360
01:26:57,287 --> 01:27:00,962
Just be thankful someone took you in, darling.
It's cold out there.

1361
01:27:02,007 --> 01:27:06,125
And then I remembered the title of your play
as told to me by Madame Oliver.

1362
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:10,122
Abandoned.

1363
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,518
And then I knew that you...

1364
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:17,479
- Please...
- Monsieur Robin Upward...

1365
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:19,995
Or rather, Monsieur Evelyn Hope,

1366
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:23,119
you were also adopted, is that not so?

1367
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:25,601
Is that not so?

1368
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:30,799
Yeah.

1369
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:42,478
Yeah.

1370
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:49,558
Don't look at me.

1371
01:27:51,807 --> 01:27:53,718
Please!

1372
01:27:56,087 --> 01:27:58,078
Don't look at me.

1373
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:10,158
(CHURCH BELLS PEALING)

1374
01:28:21,847 --> 01:28:23,838
Hello, there.

1375
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:29,041
- Not late, am I? We said four o'clock, didn't we?
- I believe we said three o'clock, madam.

1376
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,884
Oh, well, never mind.

1377
01:28:30,927 --> 01:28:32,883
So, it was Robin Upward.

1378
01:28:33,847 --> 01:28:35,838
Whilst I was sitting in the car.

1379
01:28:35,887 --> 01:28:40,039
I must confess I'm astonished.
I was certain it was the doctor or Joe Burch.

1380
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:44,205
I am afraid, Madame, that your female intuition,
it has taken the day off.

1381
01:28:44,247 --> 01:28:47,364
Nonsense.
My mind was on other things, that's all.

1382
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:50,126
I am so sorry that your play
will not now be written.

1383
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:53,125
You can be sorry if you like, Poirot.
Personally, I'm overjoyed.

1384
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:56,045
Now, hop in. I'll take you back to London.

1385
01:28:57,687 --> 01:29:00,201
I'll just move these. Give you some room.

1386
01:29:11,007 --> 01:29:15,523
So, who was it who tried to push you
under a train? Robin Upward?

1387
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:18,718
Non, non, non, non. Let me explain it to you.

1388
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,998
Over a period of years,
in the town of Stoke-on-Trent,

1389
01:29:22,047 --> 01:29:25,039
a number of people who were terminally ill

1390
01:29:25,087 --> 01:29:31,196
are assisted in their suicides by taking drugs
that are prescribed by a local doctor.

1391
01:29:31,247 --> 01:29:33,238
A crime,

1392
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:35,278
mercy killing.

1393
01:29:35,327 --> 01:29:38,399
- Dr Rendell?
- Oui, d'accord.

1394
01:29:38,447 --> 01:29:41,723
Enfin, the gossips, they begin
to write letters of malice.

1395
01:29:41,767 --> 01:29:46,761
But I could not find any evidence
that the doctor benefited financially.

1396
01:29:47,807 --> 01:29:51,163
But the tongues, they will flap, n'est-ce pas?

1397
01:29:51,207 --> 01:29:54,563
The doctor has a wife with a neurosis.

1398
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:56,598
So they have begun a new life in Broadhinny.

1399
01:29:56,647 --> 01:29:58,558
(SCREAMING)

1400
01:30:00,087 --> 01:30:02,806
Tout va bien.

1401
01:30:02,847 --> 01:30:05,645
Until comes along the meddling little Belgian.

1402
01:30:07,287 --> 01:30:09,755
Oui. C'est moi.

1403
01:30:10,807 --> 01:30:12,798
But Poirot, you know he is immortal.

1404
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:16,522
And what is more, he knows everything.

1405
01:30:16,567 --> 01:30:18,558
Par exemple,

1406
01:30:18,607 --> 01:30:21,405
he knows it was you that night at Laburnums.

1407
01:30:21,447 --> 01:30:23,278
You were the girl.

1408
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:27,236
And Poirot, he also knows your real name.

1409
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:30,956
It is Craig, n'est-ce pas?

1410
01:30:34,407 --> 01:30:36,398
And Eva Kane was your governess.

1411
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:41,202
She killed my mother.

1412
01:30:43,007 --> 01:30:46,397
I went there that night to take my revenge.

1413
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:49,438
I was going to kill her.

1414
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,478
But...

1415
01:30:52,527 --> 01:30:54,518
she was already dead.

1416
01:30:55,767 --> 01:30:59,282
And now I know it wasn't her after all.

1417
01:31:02,607 --> 01:31:04,598
Thank God I didn't pull the trigger.

1418
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:10,278
So,

1419
01:31:10,327 --> 01:31:13,558
do you intend to charge me or something?

1420
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,963
It is time to go.

1421
01:31:30,967 --> 01:31:33,117
So go.

1422
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:43,518
Bonne chance.

1423
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,677
Whitehaven Mansions, if you please.
