The detective is not given a full explanation for his assignment, but he soon observes the palpable animosity, suspicion, and resentment among the three Lee sons. Also in attendance is the beautiful Pilar Estravados, the only surviving child of Lee's daughter, who recently passed away after living in exile in Spain. The ruthless Senior Lee, who made his fortune in the South African diamond fields, sadistically treats his progeny with deliberate cruelty and obviously relishes pitting one against the other. It comes as no surprise when the old man's throat is mysteriously cut in an apparently locked room, and although he was frail and wheelchair-bound, there appears to be evidence of a great struggle. Poirot is aided in his quest for a solution to the baffling mystery by Chief Inspector Japp and local Superintendent Sugden.\u2014duke1029", "Poirot had hoped for a quiet Christmas at home but two events put an end to that. The first is that the boiler in his apartment building breaks down and there is no chance of its repair until after the holiday. The second is a call from the wealthy Simeon Lee asking Poirot to come and stay at his estate as he feels his life is in danger. Lee had made his fortune in diamonds in South Africa and will be hosting a bevy of guests over the holidays. They include his three sons, including Harry Lee who hasn't been in England for may years and is the black sheep of the family and his granddaughter, Pilar. When Lee is found murdered in his study, Poirot rescues Inspector Japp from a Christmas with his in-laws and they investigate. Lee was universally disliked by all of his relatives but as our detectives learn, it is equally important to learn the identities of unknown relatives.\u2014garykmcd", "Four days before Christmas, Hercule Poirot receives a phone call from Mr Simeon Lee, a mining magnate. He is inviting all his family over to his mansion in Shropshire for Christmas and needs Poirot around, as he fears someone will try to kill him. With nothing significant planned for Christmas and his central heating broken, Poirot agrees. Upon his arrival at the mansion, it is immediately apparent that Lee and his family don't see eye-to-eye at all. Lee calls a family meeting in which he mentions that he is about to change his will. That night he is murdered. Poirot is immediately on the case and enlists the help of Chief Inspector Japp, who is on holiday in nearby Wales with his family.\u2014grantss"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0110014", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 2825, "number_of_episodes": 70}
