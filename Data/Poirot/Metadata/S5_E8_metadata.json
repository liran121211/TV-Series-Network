Poirot is staying at the Metropolitan hotel, as are Mr. Opalsen, a theatrical producer, and his wife who is an actress starring in a play at a local theatre. A set of valuable pearls which Mrs. Opalsen wears in the play is stolen from her room, and suspicion falls on her maid Celestine, who was in the room next door. Celestine loves Andrew, the impoverished young author of Mrs. Opalsen's play but they cannot afford to get married and she is accused of taking the jewels to finance their marriage. Poirot solves the case and unmasks the real culprit, being rewarded by Opalsen and getting a bonus when he identifies the real Lucky Len.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "Under doctor's order to take a rest, Poirot heads to the seaside for a stay at the Grand Metropolitan hotel. Across the hall from him is a theatrical producer, Ed Opalson and his actress-wife Margaret. Something of a showman, Opalson has recently purchased an extremely valuable string of pearls to be used in his new play about theft of just such a piece of jewelry. When the jewels go missing, Opalson would like Poirot to investigate but with Captain Hastings reminding him of his doctor's instructions, he refuses. Unfortunately, a local newspaper is running a contest where anyone who finds \"Lucky Len\", whose image is printed in the paper and who bears a striking resemblance to Poirot, will receive \u00a310. Unable to get any peace, he takes on the case.\u2014garykmcd", "Hercule Poirot is suffering from fatigue so his doctor recommends he leave London and have a holiday.
