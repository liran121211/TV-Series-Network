1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,961
Let me tell you about the Swift family.

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:04,959
We're not nerds. We're Black nerds.

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:06,628
Oh, and billionaires

4
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:09,172
with the fastest whips
that money can buy.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:10,256
And swag.

6
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:13,009
That's me, and here's my family.

7
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,011
My parents and my cousin Lino.

8
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:17,013
We're not the Obamas, we're not ballers.

9
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:19,641
Nobody won a championship.
We're inventors.

10
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:22,185
And for the past 80
years, if it has an engine,

11
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,187
me, my grandfather
or my dad are the ones

12
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,397
who gave you the keys.

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,942
And today, we're going to Saturn.

14
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,151
Want to come?

15
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,337
Has anyone seen Tom?
Has anyone seen Tom?

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,047
Barton is starting his speech.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,848
I'll take your questions
about the launch.

18
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,642
Mr. Swift, you stake the fate
of your company on this venture.

19
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:03,977
Why now?

20
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:05,895
Why Saturn?

21
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:07,939
A successful mission to Saturn

22
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:10,066
will usher in a new era

23
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:13,528
of commercial space travel
for Swift Enterprises.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,654
Can your chief

25
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:16,364
of special projects engineering

26
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,907
tell us about the ship?

27
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,993
You mean my son, Tom.

28
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:24,706
Tom... I...

29
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:26,207
Tom...

30
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm Claire Cormier,
SVP of Special Projects.

31
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:29,169
I'll take the question.

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,628
You're asking about the ship.

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,797
As with everything with
Swift Enterprises...

34
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,718
My word, Zenzi! Zenzi!

35
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,179
- Oh!
- Hi. When did you get in?

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,805
- Two hours ago.
- Oh.

37
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,640
- Not a bag, not a wrinkle.
- Ugh.

38
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:45,393
Uh! I need your nighttime
routine immediately.

39
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:46,787
I will tell you later, Aunt Lorraine.

40
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,771
They need Tom at the press conference.

41
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:51,733
We're not the Obamas,
we're not ballers...

42
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,443
Lino, do you know where Tom is?

43
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:55,296
Your uncle's press conference
already started, and...

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,071
What are you doing?

45
00:01:57,113 --> 00:02:00,074
Tom and I built these jump shoes
to help me with my vertical.

46
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,869
They're not finished,
but I'm not waiting.

47
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,038
Oh, there's Isaac. He
must be on his way to Tom.

48
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,456
Don't walk away!

49
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,416
Goodbye, Lino. Isaac?

50
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,501
Isaac? Tom is late

51
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,670
for the most important
press event that we've...

52
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,841
Welcome back.

53
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,094
Careful. They just waxed.

54
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,227
Tom, you're late!

55
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:37,946
It's done.

56
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,739
Barclay, start the propulsion system.

57
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,449
Outstanding. Your best friend is here.

58
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,617
Hi, Zenzi.

59
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,410
Hi, Barclay. How's my favorite AI?

60
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,037
I'm well.

61
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,332
Ooh, I'm impressed.

62
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,174
You spent a full year
playing house in Atlanta

63
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,169
and didn't get thick.

64
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,505
You know the press conference
started ten minutes ago.

65
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,215
Come on. They're looking for you.

66
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,967
You know this is unnecessary.

67
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,760
You're safer when you're alert.

68
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,763
I'll make sure the transport for
the propulsion system is secure.

69
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,599
Maybe I can just hire a man to treat me

70
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,226
as good as your bodyguard treats you.

71
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,021
Barclay, search for
candidates for Zenzi's new man.

72
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,399
Do not search, Barclay.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,401
We have to go.

74
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:18,903
Tom.

75
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,532
- Uncle Barton.
- Zenzi.

76
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:24,367
Welcome home.

77
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,409
Thank you.

78
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,869
I heard great things

79
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:28,955
- about your work for us in Atlanta.
- Well...

80
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,790
Well.

81
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:32,667
Would you excuse us?

82
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,086
Um...

83
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:38,464
- Sure.
- Thanks.

84
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:45,596
You pulled the propulsion
system without notifying me?

85
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,598
I upped the reaction rate to make sure

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,976
you get to Saturn and
back in one year's time.

87
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,853
It's ready for Mission Control now.

88
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,981
Boy, have you lost your damn mind?

89
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,824
While I'm gone, you need to grow up.

90
00:03:57,865 --> 00:03:59,784
Be a man.

91
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:02,995
A man meets his deadlines.

92
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:06,290
A man doesn't prance around half naked

93
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,792
and wear pants that are

94
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,377
- vacuum-sealed to his ass.
- Got it.

95
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,172
- Be a man. Will do.
- You look at me

96
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,049
while I'm speaking to you,

97
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,009
and you watch your tone.

98
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:21,597
You will have more
responsibility heaped upon you

99
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,267
than you even know.

100
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:30,273
You're just not ready yet.

101
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,359
And your sensitivity...

102
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:39,157
is why I'm making Claire
interim CEO instead of you.

103
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,200
What?

104
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,995
I'm the one who found a meteorite

105
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,413
and turned it into the fuel

106
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:47,415
that will get you to outer space.

107
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:50,168
My sensitive ass and
tailored pants are the reason

108
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,086
you can even go on this journey at all.

109
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,588
And my last name is the reason

110
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,229
why you have an
observatory to play with.

111
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:59,802
You can learn a lot from how Claire
runs the company while I'm away.

112
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,304
I taught her everything she knows.

113
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,811
Well, if being CEO means
being like you and Claire,

114
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,563
then I'm good.

115
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:16,152
Well, if you feel that way, then...

116
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,905
there's no reason for
you to come to the launch.

117
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:53,523
Bye, Dad.

118
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:13,084
Make sure that you
mention in your speech

119
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,086
- _
- that the company is not overextended,

120
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,255
and after your father
returns from Saturn

121
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,465
our stock value will skyrocket.

122
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,759
Tom? Hi, honey.

123
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,971
Tom, Justin is about to
become the youngest partner

124
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,515
at my favorite IP firm.

125
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:30,726
I wanted you two to meet
sooner, but Tom has been so busy.

126
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,937
He was on the cover of Vanity Fair.

127
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,356
I saw the Complex video
on your shoe collection.

128
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,691
It's my crowning achievement.

129
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:37,960
Not revolutionizing space travel?

130
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,485
Doesn't everyone do that?

131
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,946
Well, I'll let you two
get better acquainted.

132
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,864
I need to go freshen my lipstick

133
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:46,134
- before my husband turns his spaceship around.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,619
And if I may be so bold,

135
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:52,248
"Thomas and Justin Chase-Swift"
would be an excellent monogram.

136
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,420
Sorry. She's very extra.

137
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,589
Yeah. She's not wrong, though.

138
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,134
- I'd put you on main.
- Ooh.

139
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:05,469
I'd maybe give you a story.

140
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,806
So, what does a genius inventor do

141
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,808
when he's not inventing or genius-ing?

142
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,811
I have been known to eat and also drink.

143
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,229
Okay.

144
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,439
We could maybe go do that.

145
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,109
Oh...

146
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:22,236
I just need to make a quick rescue.

147
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,157
Excuse me. You dropped this.

148
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,370
Thanks.

149
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,249
- Congressman Eskol.
- Hey, Tom.

150
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,626
- Hey.
- Hi.

151
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,294
Are you trying to steal our hottest,

152
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,755
- youngest, singlest executive?
- Oh.

153
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:44,842
Would you stop? He was
just offering career advice.

154
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:47,386
And I won't keep you. That
call's about to come in, I hear,

155
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,096
- so, good luck.
- Thank you.

156
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,518
I haven't talked to my dad
since he got on the ship, Zenzi.

157
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,022
- I think he's still too disappointed...
- Stop, stop.

158
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:01,400
You are the reason we went to space.

159
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,902
Ladies and gentlemen,

160
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,362
your attention, please.

161
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,030
The moment we have all been waiting for.

162
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:08,783
This is your victory lap.

163
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,879
Today, Swift Enterprises has proven

164
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:25,383
that the sci-fi dream of
long-distance space travel

165
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,385
is possible.

166
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,890
Barclay, take us to Saturn.

167
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:40,856
Hey, Dad, can you hear me?

168
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,403
Now this would be a bad time

169
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,004
to leave me on read. I mean, what's up?

170
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,496
Okay...

171
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:59,500
Uh, looks like we're
having some technical, uh...

172
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,626
Tom!

173
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:05,464
No! No.

174
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,258
No, no, no, no.

175
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:11,971
Dad?

00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,628
and without fear.

183
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,797
I was proud to call him a friend.

184
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,467
Thank you.

185
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,885
Son.

186
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:56,599
Thank you for being the man
your father taught you to be.

187
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,195
Sorry.

188
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:26,086
Barclay, run another simulation
of my father's flight path

189
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,088
with the variables that I wanted.

190
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,299
They're waiting for you.

191
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:43,145
Thank you all for coming.

192
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,815
I...

193
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:51,403
Well,

194
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:54,114
my father is...

195
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,413
My... my father...

196
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:03,099
You pulled the propulsion
system without notifying me?

197
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,248
While I'm gone, you need
to grow up. Be a man.

198
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,335
Tom!

199
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:10,381
He's dead.

200
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:15,052
And it's all my fault.

201
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,180
He's dead.

202
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:21,183
Uh, he's, uh...

203
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,604
We will miss your father, Tom.

204
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:29,900
I know you must be so shaken.

205
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,902
You know, my favorite
memory of your dad is from

206
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:34,530
when I used to visit
your house as a kid.

207
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:38,242
I would bomb around Swift
Manor on my little pink bike.

208
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:41,537
You know, the one with the
streamers on the handlebars.

209
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,416
And everyone would tell me
to slow down, or I'd crash.

210
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,170
And one day, I did.

211
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:55,175
And when your father
found me in the bushes

212
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:58,137
with my knees all scraped up,

213
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,180
he didn't yell.

214
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,601
You're just not ready yet.

215
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:07,730
And your sensitivity is
why I'm making Claire...

216
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,189
He walked me back

217
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,358
to my bike and taught
me how to ride faster...

218
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,986
safely.

219
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:20,743
I'll keep riding fast, Uncle Barton.

220
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,873
Goodbye.

221
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,634
Boy, have you lost your damn mind?

222
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,428
You want to get out of here?

223
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,473
Um... sure.

224
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:45,059
I need to go feel something else.

225
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:51,273
I am sorry Tom disappointed you.

226
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,653
Oh, that's not fair.

227
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,280
His father just died. He's grieving.

228
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:00,783
And he's in pain.

229
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,910
No. I understand that, but

230
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:06,205
from what I just saw,
he may not be ready

231
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:09,166
for what the Tubman
social group requires.

232
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,044
We need leaders for The Mountaintop.

233
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:17,216
Where is Tom, anyway?

234
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,513
My sensitive ass and tailored pants

235
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:24,658
are the reason you can even
go on this journey at all.

236
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,934
Tom!

237
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,501
Are you ready to go back to the repast?

238
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:56,505
My father was right about me.

239
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,217
I'm sensitive,

240
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,136
and I am weak.

241
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,437
I respectfully disagree.

242
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,956
Tom, I ran the simulation you wanted.

243
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:35,544
TL;DR, but the explosion
started outside the ship's hull.

244
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,088
Then it wasn't my fault.

245
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,673
My propulsion system didn't fail.

246
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,258
I didn't kill my dad.

247
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:46,388
I'm gonna find out what did.

248
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,148
I need to collect satellite
data for my dad's ship

249
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,233
as it passed through
its early flight plan.

250
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,611
I'm going to reconstruct what happened.

251
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:02,005
I'll put in a request
with the House Committee

252
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,490
on Science, Space and Technology,

253
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:06,075
but it's going to take time, Tom.

254
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:09,119
Congressman,

255
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,914
my parents bankrolled
your last campaign.

256
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:15,583
Right? So, unless you
want to go work the pole

257
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:16,603
for small-dollar donors online,

258
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,271
you're gonna get me what I
need, and you're gonna get it...

259
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,588
Watch your tone

260
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,465
when you're talking to the congressman.

261
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,009
Okay, bodyguard.

262
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,766
- Give your mother my best.
- Mm.

263
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,111
Got a prospective client for you.

264
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:43,779
Ward Chemicals.

265
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,989
They're requesting that
you engineer a good soap.

266
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,616
- Oh, like, soap soap?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,993
No. We build clean energy
systems and navigation tech.

268
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,638
If they want soap, they
can go to the corner store.

269
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,622
Listen, those clients are a lifeline.

270
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:56,208
Swift Enterprises' stock is in freefall.

271
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,001
We need a win to change the narrative

272
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:00,629
that we did blow all of our
assets on a project that...

273
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:04,716
didn't go as... planned.

274
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:12,307
Meanwhile, Claire

275
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:15,894
wants to make her interim
CEO position a forever thing.

276
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,855
She is trying to steal your company.

277
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,982
You are watching too
many Hamlet TikToks.

278
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,335
The board will name a permanent
CEO at the end of the year,

279
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,777
and it could still be you

280
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,196
if you would just stop
punishing yourself.

281
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:29,241
Zenzi, the only thing
punishing me is that eyeliner.

282
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:31,160
Goodbye. Bye.

283
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:33,287
Mm-hmm.

284
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,297
Rooibos or Earl Grey?

285
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,882
- Earl Grey.
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,761
I've been looking into what
happened to Dad's spaceship,

287
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,722
- and, um...
- Tom,

288
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,641
I just want to drink some tea, darling.

289
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,477
So,

290
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,814
did you have a chance to
talk to Justin at the repast?

291
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:03,066
He's a decent...

292
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:05,110
conversationalist.

293
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:07,070
He's perfect. No.

294
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:11,575
He's that Mayor Pete, but with
an upper lip and a better jaw.

295
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:18,832
I'm sorry about the speech, Mom.

296
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,378
And I know you were overcome with grief,

297
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,340
in front of all those people.

298
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:30,052
But there won't be crowds on Saturday.

299
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:33,222
The dedication of
your father's memorial.

300
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,100
I'll be there.

301
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:40,520
I promise.

302
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,523
I've analyzed all the data,

303
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,783
and there's no way that
explosion was triggered

304
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,110
from inside the ship.

305
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,630
I need to see if
anything hit my dad's ship

306
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,948
when it left the atmosphere.

307
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:54,284
Isaac, have you ever accessed
classified satellite data?

308
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,536
Yes, but not without a SCIF.

309
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,997
A sensitive compartmented
investigation facility,

310
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,758
like the retinal scan folder
where you keep all your porn.

311
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,034
Seriously, bro?

312
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,295
What-what about a lab?

313
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:07,422
Or a university.

314
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,967
Every MIT reject's
favorite safety school

315
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,635
is Windsor Polytechnic.

316
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:13,387
It's a half-hour from here.

317
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:14,845
And you think they'll just let
you borrow their SCIF thing?

318
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,306
No.

319
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:20,936
Barclay, compose an email
to Windsor Polytechnic.

320
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:26,024
"Dear Dean of Students, my
name is Tom Swift... yes,"

321
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,568
that Tom Swift...

322
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,654
and I'd like to endow a scholarship

323
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,447
for Black engineering students.

324
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,491
Would $20 million work?

325
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,827
We'd need to throw a VIP reception

326
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,162
announcing the gift by end of week.

327
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:42,291
Please respond by EOD.

328
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,759
"Thank you."

329
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,836
Send message.

330
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,587
They may not let me borrow the SCIF,

331
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,923
but they'll sure as
hell let me endow it.

332
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,842
Which car, Tom?

333
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,804
G-Wagen. We're gonna need space.

334
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:57,407
The SCIF room's covered
by an alarm system,

335
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,890
activated by sound.

336
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,225
Oh, I have something for that.

337
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,396
Dampeners. They'll keep us
from setting off the alarms.

338
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:11,194
Uh-huh. Barclay, put this on the screen.

339
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,991
It's like a selfie-steam.

340
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:17,385
It's a nano-polymer camera I developed

341
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:18,785
for taking better nudes.

342
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,370
So the steam is taking the photo.

343
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,514
We'll pipe it into the SCIF so I can see

344
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:22,765
what's on the screen inside it.

345
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,374
I'll take over the workstation.

346
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,917
Isaac, I want you to get us

347
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,502
into the restricted area,

348
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:29,212
kill the door alarm and pick the lock.

349
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:30,254
Lino, you will stay on
surveillance at the G-Wagen.

350
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:31,715
Look at me.

351
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:34,968
Stay focused. No Overwatch.

352
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,845
Come on! I want to go for real!

353
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:40,307
And... you get to disable
the cameras so I can break in.

354
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,642
Huh? Ah.

355
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:47,564
And now we just need
someone to distract the dean.

356
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:51,234
Somebody who asks a lot
of unnecessary questions.

357
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:54,404
No. No, absolutely not.

358
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:56,323
I'm not doing crime.

359
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,867
Girl, it's not crime. It's research.

360
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,137
Don't you want to find out
what happened to your godfather?

361
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:03,955
I also want to keep his company afloat.

362
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:08,794
So, I need the soap revolution we
promised Ward Chemicals by Thursday.

363
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,629
- Weekend.
- Friday.

364
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,381
Done.

365
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,549
I want a wardrobe budget.

366
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:52,421
Com-strips. Earbuds felt passé.

367
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,759
Wow.

368
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,387
Eskol came. I saw his
name on the guest list,

369
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,598
- but, I...
- Oh, is that why you wore that breakup outfit?

370
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,350
- Um...
- Tom.

371
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,978
- Dean Brooks.
- We're so grateful for your generosity.

372
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:10,063
Oh, it's my pleasure. My pleasure.

373
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:13,775
With your donation, we're gonna
be able to build the Swift...

374
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:29,875
the plan to sort of
help get us through this...

375
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,755
Coast is clear. Go now.

376
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,275
Yeah, yeah, he wouldn't let us do that.

377
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,675
Gonna get a drink.

378
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay.

379
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,446
- So, good talking to you.
- Uh, Dean Brooks,

380
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,096
have you met our congressman?

381
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,681
No, I haven't.

382
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:46,600
Please allow me to introduce you.

383
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,281
- Wow, Zenzi.
- Good evening, Congressman.

384
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:17,589
Running the footage back
three seconds, and...

385
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:19,382
looping it.

386
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:22,052
Like you were never there.

387
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,251
Barclay, you should be able
to begin the data transfer now.

388
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,387
Someone's coming, Tom. Get out!

389
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:07,764
He can't. There are
terabytes of data left.

390
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:09,391
75% there.

391
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,351
Hurry up, Tom.

392
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,447
See? There's no one here.

393
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:25,740
Our security system said

394
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:27,534
there was a breach on your watch.

395
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:29,744
I thought you were making
a lifelong commitment

396
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:32,289
- to the organization.
- I am.

397
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,249
Leadership knows that.

398
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,917
I've proven my loyalty.

399
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,460
Yes, I've spoken with them.

400
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:39,588
They've decided to
treat you with leniency.

401
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:56,896
I'll wipe the surveillance tapes.

402
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,649
Take care of this.

403
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:06,740
Tom, where the hell are you?

404
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:07,781
I don't have him.

405
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:08,992
Me, neith...

406
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,535
Oh, wait! Binary code!

407
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:11,995
"Leave without me..."

408
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:13,681
Barclay, you and Tom
have a secret language?

409
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:16,333
It's cipher code he
invented when he was nine.

410
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:20,712
Now he's says, "Seriously,
Isaac, get Z and leave."

411
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:25,300
Take off your clothes.

412
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,805
We need to leave here undetected.

413
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,853
I know D.C. has a lot to offer,

414
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:39,147
but I'm putting down roots in New York.

415
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:40,899
Ah, that'll be D.C.'s loss.

416
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,943
Lovely party, Congressman.

417
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,945
♪ You just lift your head up high... ♪

418
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,782
Tom says, "Don't make
a scene, act natural."

419
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:52,452
Didn't know you could dance.

420
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,996
My ex-girlfriend
insisted we take lessons.

421
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:56,998
- Girlfriend?
- What?

422
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,459
You don't think trans
guys have annoying exes?

423
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:02,045
I didn't think Army
Rangers could foxtrot.

424
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,965
You and I have never danced.

425
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:12,972
Something must've happened to Tom.

426
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:29,698
Where did that man in
the suit come from, huh?

427
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:32,009
A-and what organization is he
working for? The government?

428
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,969
A private group? And how did
you know I would need rescuing?

429
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:35,412
I was just a guest at the party

430
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:36,913
who saw something about to go down.

431
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,832
Oh, come on. Don't give
me strong silent top.

432
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:40,500
Somebody had to know we were in there.

433
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,502
- People are watching you, Tom.
- What people?

434
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,129
This way!

435
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:55,849
Nice nails, though.

436
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,393
The congressman into glitter?

437
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:02,772
Look, where I'm from,
nothing was pretty,

438
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:06,651
so I like to see something
beautiful every day.

439
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,326
If you would just answer my questions.

440
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,953
Why did you get involved at all?

441
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:18,955
You're Eskol's bodyguard.

442
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:21,833
And why did you risk your
actual neck to help me? Huh?

443
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,853
Because you deserve to know
what happened to your father.

444
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:25,170
How do you know my father?

445
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:27,046
- Wait. H... how do you... Wait.
- I... I...

446
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:30,383
Wait. Wait. Wait! Wait!

447
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:33,386
All right? Isaac, he helped me.

448
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:35,722
He's a friend.

449
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:40,268
I hope you find what you need, Tom.

450
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,145
Thank you.

451
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:43,271
I don't know your name.

452
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:45,356
- Rowan.
- Rowan,

453
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:47,984
have a good day.

454
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:52,423
Where have you been all night?

455
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,782
I got detained.

456
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:54,967
Did you get the data? What happened?

457
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,576
Okay, I-I need to work on this.

458
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:58,512
No time for the Zenzi show.
I... I'll explain later.

459
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,663
Uh, I-I think you
mispronounced "thank you."

460
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,457
I just helped you with
an illegal mission?

461
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,584
Okay, Zenzi, thank you for helping me.

462
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:08,463
I got what I needed, and
I'm okay. Are you good?

463
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,800
- You done? All right.
- Gonna ignore that.

464
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,302
You need to stop treating
us like the hired help.

465
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:16,638
Uh, by "us", you mean the
people who work for me?

466
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,140
I mean your brother, who loves you,

467
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:21,518
your mom, who's done
literally everything for you,

468
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,312
me, who is constantly
picking up your slack.

469
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:26,189
Girl, everything you have, you have

470
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:29,192
because you're my playmate,
so maybe stop right there.

471
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:32,195
Oh, okay. Well, as
your business colleague,

472
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,197
I put everything on the
line for you tonight while

473
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,900
all you've done is embarrass
me with Ward Chemicals.

474
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,719
No. You're asking me to do
soap in the middle of all this?

475
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:40,703
I am telling you that
while you're on your quest

476
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,705
for justice, people's
lives are on the line,

477
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,749
but you're too selfish to see that.

478
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,167
- Excuse me?
- Your father

479
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,378
never would have blown off this project.

480
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,648
Your father would have made
sure his thousands of employees

481
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:52,382
- kept their jobs.
- Yeah. Uh, uh...

482
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:54,551
And that's why your dad
chose Claire to be CEO

483
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:58,721
and not you, because
you are a spoiled brat

484
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:00,807
who would rather play
fix-it with his stupid toys

485
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,851
than to lift a finger
to help anyone else.

486
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,894
You're right.

487
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:07,564
I don't stop trying to fix things,

488
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,566
because I will never fix me.

489
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,872
Uncle Barton loved
you. No, no, no, no, no.

490
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:15,572
He never would have said otherwise

491
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,615
because it wouldn't
be socially acceptable

492
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:21,286
for him to admit that he was
embarrassed to have a gay son.

493
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:24,581
So I will never be the man
my father wanted me to be.

494
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:28,126
Now he's dead.

495
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:35,717
I've analyzed all the data
you stole from the SCIF,

496
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,011
and I found something interesting.

497
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,263
When your dad's ship
left Earth's thermosphere,

498
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:41,490
it passed right by a satellite

499
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,474
- that took a shot at him.
- "Shot"?

500
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,184
C-can you show me

501
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,145
what you compiled from
those satellite images?

502
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:51,399
Whatever they shot at Barton's ship,

503
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,026
it was very sticky.

504
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:55,486
And then, six months later...

505
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:00,533
It killed my dad.

506
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,869
Which satellite fired the projectile?

507
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,538
I couldn't find any info on it. Okay.

508
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,957
Go through your visual memory
cache in the past two weeks.

509
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,709
Have we seen that symbol anywhere?

510
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,711
Is it in any graphic database online?

511
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:13,296
I need to give you a tune-up.

512
00:29:13,338 --> 00:29:14,881
You're skipping.

513
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,842
Found it in the selfie-photo steam.

514
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:20,136
Phone should be ringing,
'cause you called it.

515
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:22,639
Barclay, text Justin:

516
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,058
"You up?"

517
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:28,978
He already texted you back.

518
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,817
Barclay, send text:

519
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,694
"Can you use your lawyer
connects to find out

520
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:37,737
who owns this satellite?"

521
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:38,863
Sent.

522
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:40,657
I think he was disappointed

523
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:42,659
that you didn't text a selfie back.

524
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,327
How do you know he's disappointed?

525
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:46,329
The dots go slower when he types.

526
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:48,331
Sad boys type slow.

527
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,751
Oh, wait, he sent an audio text.

528
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:54,170
This logo doesn't exist
in any corporate register.

529
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:57,590
But the launchpad belongs
to a private company.

530
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,592
You know its founder.

531
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,679
Your good friend, the congressman.

532
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,348
So Eskol is allied with neck-breakers

533
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,850
and he murdered your dad.

534
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:10,728
- Ready to send your reply?
- No.

535
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:19,195
Is this paper?

536
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:20,863
How timeless.

537
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,008
I couldn't say it over the
phone, but Eskol's company,

538
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,718
- Stone Corporation...
- Okay, could he have tried

539
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,160
to call it something less evil?

540
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,495
They're rumored to be a front

541
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:28,997
for an Illuminati-scale group

542
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,540
called The Road Back.

543
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,378
Supposedly, The Road
Back wants to prevent

544
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,964
the technological
advancement of humanity.

545
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,679
My father was murdered

546
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:47,306
by a group working to undermine

547
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,726
everything Swift Enterprises stands for.

548
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,894
Hey, hey.

549
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:54,022
I'll help you find more info.

550
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,651
Lorraine will kill me

551
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,528
if I get her favorite young lawyer

552
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,655
wrapped up in this mess.

553
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:06,993
Crap.

554
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,537
- Lorraine. I... I have to go.
- But...

555
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,461
Mom.

556
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,172
I'm sorry I missed the dedication.

557
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,798
But I've been trying...

558
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,818
Reverend Jones said your
absence proved you're not ready

559
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,469
to move up in the Tubman social group.

560
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,071
I-I don't care about the
reverend's dinner club

561
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:27,865
for old people. I've
been trying to tell you...

562
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:29,891
That is quite enough, Tom.

563
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:33,478
I'm just happy your
father isn't here to see

564
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,230
the trifling behavior of his only son.

565
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:42,236
You know, I-I have shielded you

566
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:44,363
from more than you will ever know.

567
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:47,617
I thought someday you would grow up

568
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,118
and realize your potential.

569
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,245
I see now it was a mistake.

570
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,294
Your father's gone.

571
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:02,715
Now it's up to me to
pick up where he left off.

572
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,702
If I can't fix my life,
I'll fix these shoes.

573
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,463
Make some soap for Zenzi.

574
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,453
I designed a nano-hydraulic
system to work

575
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:40,122
with the compacted bioethanol
I threw together last night.

576
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,334
Whoa.

577
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,253
It's spotless.

578
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:47,421
Bro, the biofuel just cleaned this tank.

579
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:50,049
I multi-tasked.

580
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:57,139
Meet the state-of-the-art soap

581
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,475
that we're licensing to Ward Chemicals.

582
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:01,978
This non-flammable liquid
dissolves surface particles

583
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:05,815
while purifying air on contact.

584
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,650
Oh, you're welcome.

585
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:09,610
I just saved the company.

586
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,821
I know what my father thought of me.

587
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,448
That I'm too "sensitive"

588
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,534
to be CEO, but that's only

589
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,327
because he thought in order to lead,

590
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,162
you had to be boring...

591
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:23,416
and basic and ordinary.

592
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,753
Like you, Claire.

593
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,008
But I know that having an imagination,

594
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,678
a willingness to learn and
the balls to try new things

595
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,346
will take you much further

596
00:35:37,388 --> 00:35:39,473
than kissing the right asses will.

597
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,518
So...

598
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,854
I'm not giving up my company.

599
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,234
I'm coming for the crown.

600
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:54,488
Then you better not miss.

601
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,889
That file size doesn't make sense.

602
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,017
It says there are ten
terabytes of data there,

603
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,144
but it's only a few seconds long.

604
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,906
Barclay?

605
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,910
What if this data can't
be accessed by newer means?

606
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:44,080
What if we got to go retro and use

607
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,706
an old-school method instead?

608
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:47,458
Pull up a command-line interface.

609
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,543
I'm gonna do this manually.

610
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,424
Tom, listen to me.

611
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,718
My ship has been destroyed.

612
00:36:58,803 --> 00:37:02,014
I escaped into the
starboard bay that broke off

613
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,183
and sealed itself during the explosion.

614
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,894
This is timestamped three
hours after the explosion.

615
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,772
When he should've been dead.

616
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:12,024
I have one working research pod left.

617
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:15,027
It's where I'll be hiding.

618
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,546
I'm sending a hypervelosic
capsule back to Earth

619
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:21,450
that will give you everything
you need to find me.

620
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:26,747
It cannot wind up in
anyone's hands but yours.

621
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,500
And, Tom...

622
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,043
one other thing.

623
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,842
I want you to know...

624
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,261
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

625
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,388
Recover the rest of that message!

626
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,348
I can't. It's gone.

627
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,351
But the capsule is on its
way through the atmosphere.

628
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,063
Call Zenzi. We're going for a ride.

629
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,613
Barton's message capsule
is headed for splashdown

630
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,049
in the Hudson River, 12 miles away.

631
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,658
You got this, Tom.

632
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,164
Now you've got a vantage point

633
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:10,291
on the landing spot that I projected.

634
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:13,419
The capsule should be incoming shortly.

635
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,337
So your dad's alive.

636
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,839
He sent you a capsule.

637
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,967
And Eskol is very bad?

638
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:22,178
Hmm, yeah, well, I
guess all the good ones

639
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,639
are married, gay or
criminal masterminds.

640
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,518
Thanks for looping us in.

641
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,605
I know I was harsh... on you.

642
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:35,691
And I was a dick.

643
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,151
Yeah.

644
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:39,195
Sometimes I forget that I don't...

645
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,071
I don't do anything alone.

646
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,823
Mm.

647
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,159
And it's not "the Zenzi show."

648
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:49,288
It's that I can't do this without you.

649
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,543
Is that self-awareness and
humility from the Tom Swift?

650
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,212
Are you sure we're looking for a capsule

651
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,838
- and not a flying pig?
- Okay.

652
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,465
Glad you worked it out.

653
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:02,927
But now I suggest we call
NASA and ask them for help.

654
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,905
We don't know if NASA has been
infiltrated by The Road Back.

655
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,555
And Uncle Barton will ration

656
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,599
his supplies until we find him.

657
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,351
Uncle Barton climbed
Everest with no oxygen

658
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:13,229
and a broken foot. Saturn is light work.

659
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,813
Uh-oh.

660
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,733
The capsule's signal
just broke up into pieces.

661
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,693
It must have shattered upon re-entry.

662
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,238
Fragments are spreading out as we speak.

663
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:25,324
Closest one is now headed
for the South, maybe Georgia.

664
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,909
Others will drop down in Oklahoma,

665
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:29,495
Utah, California.

666
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,247
The message got destroyed?

667
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:32,665
Wait.

668
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,917
Not destroyed.

669
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,919
Disassembled.

670
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,004
Each piece should survive re-entry.

671
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,774
Those fragments are scattering
across the entire country.

672
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:42,925
Oh, no, if only we had the resources

673
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,718
to go out and find them. Barclay,

674
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,137
track the pieces of the
capsule as they fall to Earth.

675
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,472
Tracking now.

676
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,475
I've been wanting to take a road trip.

677
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,644
Zenzi, Isaac, pack your bags.

678
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:55,771
Wheels up in an hour. Gonna
find the capsule pieces,

679
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:57,773
and reassemble the message
that my father sent.

680
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:58,941
Come on.

681
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:00,943
That's how we'll rescue him.

682
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:03,445
We can't let anyone
know what we're doing.

683
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,239
We can only trust each other.

684
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:16,083
Isaac...

685
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,836
I owe you an apology.

686
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,964
I know I can be a touch self-absorbed,

687
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:24,866
but Zenzi read me down,

688
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:27,386
and... I'm so glad

689
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:29,388
you're in my life.

690
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,849
I can't do this without you.

691
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,769
Also, your refusal to wear

692
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,063
anything other than black is enraging.

693
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,940
So...

694
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,609
I have a slightly more stylish

695
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,819
monochrome fit waiting
for you on the jet.

696
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,530
32 waist, right?

697
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,490
Thank you.

698
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,335
Look, I'll be home as quick as I can.

699
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,021
And you let me know if that
Claire person is with Mom.

700
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:02,421
Yeah.

701
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,344
Let us not depart in silence.

702
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,096
How about this one?

703
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,932
I think it says adventure.

704
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,996
I'm pleased we were able to compromise

705
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,873
the AI network undetected.

706
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,292
Barclay, he calls it?

707
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,960
Once our spyware works its way

708
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,420
through the AI's operating system,

709
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,631
we'll have full control.

710
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,176
I can count on you all to

711
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:51,553
keep Tom Swift from
discovering our plans?

712
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,180
Yes, sir.

713
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,141
