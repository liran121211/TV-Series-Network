1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,351
I'm Tom Swift, inventor, billionaire,

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,269
shoe collector extraordinaire.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:08,271
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:10,440
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

5
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:11,775
I could earn his love,

6
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:14,319
but his mission ended tragically.

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,363
Or so I thought.

8
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,239
Turns out, he was sabotaged.

9
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,034
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

10
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,036
with the data I need to
rescue him from space,

11
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:26,122
but it exploded when it
entered the atmosphere.

12
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,725
Now I have to find the
pieces of that capsule

13
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:30,794
and reassemble my dad's message.

14
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:32,712
A global conspiracy called The Road Back

15
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:35,340
is standing in my way, so
I can only trust my squad:

16
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,801
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

17
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:41,972
my adopted brother
Lino, and my AI Barclay.

18
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:43,765
Together, we're going to find my father

19
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,058
and bring him home.

20
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:55,318
Tom, we're 100 yards from
the capsule piece I found.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,153
We'll have to go on foot.

22
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,531
Zenzi, you didn't wear heels, did you?

23
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:01,282
No, but you did.

24
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:02,927
- Jodhpur boots have a natural lift, okay?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

25
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,285
How much of your father's message

26
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:05,620
is in each capsule piece?

27
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:07,998
We won't know until we reassemble it.

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,334
Wait, that's a capsule piece?

29
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,920
No, it's just wreckage.

30
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,606
Putting this capsule
back together is gonna be

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,924
more difficult than I thought.

32
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:37,569
The capsule piece we're
tracking is the "brain," right?

33
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,571
Yeah, and it unlocks the other pieces.

34
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:41,239
Without it, we're screwed.

35
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,782
I don't understand what happened.

36
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,826
I-I don't think Barclay messed up,

37
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:47,495
but I did build him when I was eight.

38
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:48,747
I'm running a defrag

39
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:50,415
and a source code analysis just in case.

40
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,584
Oh, could you translate
that out of nerd?

41
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,420
Okay, think day spa but for an AI.

42
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:56,755
A software mani-pedi,

43
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,798
then recalculating the
landing vectors by hand.

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,401
I'd translate, but you'd only understand

45
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,177
if you hadn't gotten a four on AP calc.

46
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,263
Oh, did I get a four, or
did I tell you I got a four

47
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:07,098
to make you feel cool?

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,726
Don't come for me. I'll
hack your test scores.

49
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:11,728
And I'll post your
eighth grade school photo.

50
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,981
Ooh, remember when you
tried the one-brow look?

51
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,584
O-okay, okay, you cannot
let Isaac see that.

52
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:18,985
- I have a reputation to protect.
- Oh, ooh.

53
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:24,574
Speaking of Isaac, he
mentioned an ex-girlfriend.

54
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:25,950
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:28,036
I thought he was gay.

56
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,956
He watches your shirt
move when you yawn.

57
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,792
I can't help it if
he enjoys the ab show.

58
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,251
Many people do.

59
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,212
Yeah, I know. I've seen the IG comments.

60
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:39,422
Okay, a lot of those
people need to pray.

61
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:42,801
Yes. So he's trans and bi...?

62
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:45,095
No, he's not bi. He's pansexual.

63
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,572
He's open to falling in love with people

64
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,139
across the gender spectrum.

65
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,226
Hmm, well, judging from
how he brings you coffee,

66
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,228
he's Tomsexual.

67
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,231
And I don't date men who
are interested in Tom Swift.

68
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,943
Operating level:

69
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:01,486
Beyoncé Formation Tour.

70
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,654
What did I miss?

71
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:03,947
Thank God you're back.

72
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,257
I used the satellite
data I got from Justin

73
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,826
to model the size of each capsule piece.

74
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,619
Yeah, to show how all the missing pieces

75
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:11,121
will eventually fit back together.

76
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,414
Now, Barclay, remind
us what it looked like

77
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:14,791
when the capsule broke apart.

78
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,543
The heat of the reentry

79
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,419
threw off my ability to lock on.

80
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,798
Okay, I did some vectoring
to recalculate a landing point

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,508
for the actual capsule.

82
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,177
Ooh, Zenzi, shame about that four.

83
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,346
Sorry, we're gonna have a
couple more math words here.

84
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,681
Stream to map.

85
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:30,890
If you hadn't been so busy

86
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,100
flirting with the proctors

87
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,185
that got you that two on AP geography,

88
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,980
you'd know that's the Darby estate.

89
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,440
- Chris Darby?
- Mm.

90
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:40,859
I hate that family.

91
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,571
They are pretentious and rude and...

92
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:45,905
Kind to us all the time.

93
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,866
- Isaac, they're lovely people.
- I'll reserve judgment.

94
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,702
The Darby estate was built in 1937

95
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,120
when the family discovered oil.

96
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,164
They are literally oil barons.

97
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:56,708
How cliché. Look, who even uses gas?

98
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,084
Your private jet.

99
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,711
The resources are protected

100
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:02,589
by a state-of-the-art security barrier.

101
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,799
30 feet tall, steel and concrete,

102
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,467
countermeasures unknown.

103
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,720
Why would your father send it there?

104
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,806
Couldn't it just land here?

105
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,391
He needed to protect it.

106
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,077
If he sent it here, it could
end up in the neighbor's pool

107
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,728
or smash through a coffee shop.

108
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,565
Yeah, the Darbys have over
200 acres for it to roam.

109
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,066
Should I DM Chris?

110
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,819
No. Look, we can't tell anyone.

111
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,071
We don't know who's been
compromised by The Road Back,

112
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,824
or what they'll do to us if
they know my dad is still alive.

113
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,827
What are the angles, Isaac?

114
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:33,869
It looks impenetrable.

115
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,413
How about explosives?

116
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,958
Can we try asking nicely?

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,295
A dinner? An expensive bottle of wine?

118
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,008
Are we saving your dad or not?

119
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,348
I am out of shape.

120
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,617
- Are you kidding?
- I'm serious.

121
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,518
Hey, Mom. Hi, interloper.

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,354
I need to talk to my mom.

123
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:02,273
Can you go sweat through
a shirt somewhere else?

124
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:05,902
Thomas Alexander Winston Swift,
apologize to Claire at once.

125
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,655
You're full-government-name mad?

126
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,785
I'm sorry, Claire.

127
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,066
Can I get you a glass of water?

128
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:18,373
You know, as always,
you look parched, girl.

129
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,959
Tom, I am only here to help.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,420
I'd be a great mentor
if you would let me.

131
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:26,547
Thanks, Claire.

132
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,092
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. See you, dear.

133
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:35,515
Mm. I do not understand
your distaste for her.

134
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,891
You know, she's my friend.

135
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:40,687
She plays tennis in track
pants and a headband.

136
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,813
Is she 12?

137
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:44,607
You are incorrigible.

138
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,986
I try. So, I need a favor.

139
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,822
Plan a dinner with the Darbys.

140
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,157
There's a mineral on
their property that I think

141
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,410
could be a powerful fuel source.

142
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,469
But you know them.

143
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:58,929
They won't let me explore
without kissing their asses first.

144
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:02,223
Well, they did tell us
they'd love to see us

145
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:05,477
after the funeral, but people
never mean those things.

146
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,770
Well, pretend they did.

147
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:09,147
We'll have a casual,
somewhat boring meal,

148
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,441
you'll help me out, and...

149
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:15,195
What's wrong?

150
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:20,617
It's my first social
event since your father.

151
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,118
You know, he was always...

152
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,454
he always made these things so easy.

153
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:28,750
Well, I guess I can plan
a menu and wear black,

154
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,294
and try not to slap someone

155
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:33,088
if I hear "everything
happens for a reason."

156
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,799
No, I don't want you to go through that.

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,175
I'll take care of it.

158
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:38,468
No, no, no, no. If you need me

159
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,471
to arrange this dinner, I'll do it.

160
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,765
Thank you.

161
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:46,142
And after the dinner,

162
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,770
there are some things
that we need to discuss

163
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,313
about the Tubman Social Group.

164
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:52,524
I will be your attentive student.

165
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:54,109
Right after we charm the Darbys.

166
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,986
And I expect you to be
on your best behavior.

167
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,030
And wear something respectable.

168
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,991
Like your father's cuff links.

169
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:12,085
August 30, 1983.

170
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,545
The day Guion Bluford,

171
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:16,589
the first Black man to
go to space, took off.

172
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,634
Remember how we cracked
this open when we were 15?

173
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,052
Uh-huh.

174
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,304
I got in and out so
easily, my dad never noticed

175
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,973
that his watches went missing on Friday

176
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,850
and didn't come back until Sunday night.

177
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,519
This would make Jay-Z feel broke.

178
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,147
Actually, I heard he came
to a fundraiser here once,

179
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,483
stopped rapping, started buying stocks.

180
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:37,902
Mm-hmm.

181
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,202
It's in my memory cache,

182
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:47,871
but I can't find the creation metadata.

183
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:51,041
I've been trying to figure out
why this photo is here at all.

184
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,418
It's the congressman's bodyguard Rowan.

185
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,253
Wait. Wait, this is from last week,

186
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,796
when you spoke to the congressman.

187
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,840
Watch your tone

188
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,092
when you're talking to the congressman.

189
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,969
Rowan put his hand on your shoulder

190
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,679
during that meeting, as I recall.

191
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,014
Tom didn't seem to mind.

192
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,557
What if Barclay

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,810
held onto his image because
Rowan used that moment

194
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,562
in the office to compromise him?

195
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:13,897
We need to shut down your...

196
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,982
I fixed him. It's fine.

197
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,943
A-and Barclay is not a
device. He's my friend.

198
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,071
We need him to locate that capsule.

199
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:22,173
And his internal audio and camera

200
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,615
are on a closed loop anyway,

201
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,200
so nobody can eavesdrop on us.

202
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:27,702
Everything's gonna be okay.

203
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,537
I tracked the location
of the capsule piece.

204
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:30,579
It's in their drill mines.

205
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,623
Oh, that...

206
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,041
is supposed to be dangerous.

207
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,919
Something about acid and vines.

208
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,629
Did you ever go in them?

209
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,774
Portions of the property were
corrupted by drilling runoff...

210
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,342
Okay, we don't need to hear any more.

211
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,512
I'm not going in those mines.

212
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,446
Uh... you're not going into the mines?

213
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:57,739
We'll find another way.

214
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,616
And if we can't?

215
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:00,867
Wow.

216
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,411
You look wonderful.

217
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:06,080
Your father would be proud.

218
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,542
So excited to see you.

219
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,835
Oh.

220
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,670
- Zenzi.
- Hmm?

221
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,672
What text has you smiling like that?

222
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,466
Oh, it's from Chris Darby.

223
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,552
I wonder if he's still
with that Delta from UPenn.

224
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,396
Barclay, when was the last time

225
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,317
Chris posted a simple-looking
girl with a flea market purse?

226
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,693
Ten weeks ago.

227
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,071
And it looks like she's
deleted him from hers.

228
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,656
Oh, he's single.

229
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,600
- That's interesting.
- Yeah, Chris is smart.

230
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,985
He's Black. We grew up together.

231
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,738
It could be, as Aunt
Lorraine says, interesting.

232
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,782
Chris "trifling and
also bucktoothed" Darby

233
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,385
- is interesting?
- He is not bucktoothed anymore.

234
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,910
He's pretentious. He's rude.

235
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,954
And he thinks he's the
smartest person in the room.

236
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,914
Oh, so you don't like
him because he's you?

237
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,332
Now, now, Zenzi, Tom,

238
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,626
the Darbys are just a little extra.

239
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:56,505
You know, it's the constant
one-upsmanship I can't stand.

240
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:57,974
- Mm.
- And they are obsessed

241
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,276
with keeping up with the Joneses.

242
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,760
Or the Swifts.

243
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,386
Remember when Dad special-ordered

244
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,054
- that blue Maybach?
- Oh.

245
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,515
And Mr. Darby hired a private detective

246
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:07,933
to find him one in the same color.

247
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,395
- People buy blue cars.
- Mm.

248
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:12,772
Maybe he just liked it.

249
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,816
Or maybe they're tacky,

250
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:18,194
thirsty and pressed.

251
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,655
Ooh.

252
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,990
Okay.

253
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,492
I got that out. Yeah.

254
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,243
Let's go kiss some Darby ass.

255
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:34,752
A toast to our most gracious friends

256
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,253
Mr. and Mrs. Darby...

257
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:37,797
and Chris. We are so moved

258
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,883
that you'd join us for
dinner on such short notice.

259
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:42,843
We're happy to be here, Tom.

260
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,136
I thought you invited us here

261
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,638
instead of coming to dinner

262
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,140
at our house because you still
thought our ancestral home

263
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,185
was a tacky tract house
that smelled like feet.

264
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,937
Did I say that?

265
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:54,206
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh, you know what?

266
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,564
I just needed to mature

267
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:58,818
before I could appreciate
sophisticated design.

268
00:10:58,859 --> 00:10:59,860
Oh, uh-huh.

269
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,196
Zenzi, are you back permanently?

270
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:03,531
Mm. Yes.

271
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,115
- All done with Atlanta.
- Mm.

272
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:07,159
And done with that Marcus, I hope.

273
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,494
See, I never understood you two.

274
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,830
It never seemed like a, a good fit.

275
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,832
So this is, uh...

276
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,041
this is good news for me.

277
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,086
How are you holding up?

278
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,213
You know, everything
happens for a reason.

279
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,548
Mm-hmm.

280
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:26,006
And with friends like you all

281
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,967
to support us through
this difficult time,

282
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:31,804
I'm sure we'll be able
to manage this weight.

283
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:36,266
Zenzi, I thought that
your speech at the memorial

284
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,352
- was absolutely beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,354
It was touching. It was moving.

286
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,022
It was everything a eulogy should be.

287
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:43,774
Yes, yes, it was.

288
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,567
Yes.

289
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:48,445
Well, words sometimes fail us.

290
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:52,196
But Tom's actions to build the
company speak for themselves.

291
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:53,867
Mm-hmm.

292
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:57,371
I used to love your
pool parties so much.

293
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,377
- The giant, giant ice cream trucks.
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

294
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,796
- Ice cream sandwiches. Yes.
- Yeah.

295
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,465
You loved those, Tom.

296
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,218
Yeah. Yeah, I sure did.

297
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,220
My favorite.

298
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:14,763
Thank God for cardio, right?

299
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,515
Look at your boy now.

300
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,368
Remember you used to
follow the lifeguard around?

301
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,227
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah, he was about 20.

302
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:21,854
He went to Sarah Lawrence.

303
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:24,189
Oh, you were obsessed with him.

304
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:28,318
Zenzi, uh, didn't Tom
steal one of his, um...

305
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,528
his Speedos?

306
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,405
Wait, uh, you... you did what?

307
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:34,700
- A lifeguard? I... I did not do anything.
- Yes.

308
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,326
He had to drive home in a towel.

309
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:37,554
Your dad found it in your backpack.

310
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,455
Yeah, no,

311
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,873
I-I think I remember this.

312
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,875
Well, I certainly remember.

313
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,418
Remember we had to pay him double.

314
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,254
A little boy-crush fee.

315
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,717
Hey, guys, he-he left it

316
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,278
in the bathroom and I
just brought it back.

317
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:55,137
It was... No towel involved.

318
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,597
It's okay, Tom.

319
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,473
I looked at a few bras myself.

320
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,600
Mm. I never,

321
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,518
uh, took any home with me,

322
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,312
but, you know...

323
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,149
Oh. Wait, your dad was so upset.

324
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,777
He was yelling his son had, um...

325
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,528
sugar in his tank.

326
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,906
Yes.

327
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:16,617
You see, I'm just so glad you
guys got to a place of acceptance.

328
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:18,285
That...

329
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:20,079
never... happened.

330
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,205
Oh.

331
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,792
You know, we're having

332
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,961
such a lovely time
laughing at my expense.

333
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:30,589
But you know what I think is funny?

334
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:34,134
My parents and I have
always had big laughs

335
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,596
over how every time we
buy something... mm-hmm...

336
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:40,015
the exact same thing

337
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,768
ends up at your place after you see it.

338
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,810
Hmm?

339
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,522
Hmm? It-it's almost like...

340
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,066
you guys are so desperately insecure

341
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,777
that you have no choice
but to copy and paste...

342
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:54,530
yourself a life based on ours.

343
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,281
And I think that's...

344
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:57,699
hilarious.

345
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,263
It's just, it's Tom. Tom.

346
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:20,514
You know,

347
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:24,101
Tom, you-you've got all of my humor...

348
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,228
and-and none of my tact.

349
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:30,440
Barclay,

350
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:32,025
thanks for doing this drone flyby

351
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,569
to scope out the Darby wall.

352
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,571
My pleasure. I love secret recon.

353
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:38,740
The security fence seems to be
modeled on classified technology.

354
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:40,450
I wasn't able to access blueprints,

355
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,078
but it has motion
sensors, heat tracking...

356
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,538
And sound, right?

357
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,583
Exactly. How did you know?

358
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,753
I've seen one of these before.

359
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,965
Hello, old friend.

360
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,720
Thank you.

361
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,639
You need to go deal with that.

362
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:05,224
I...

363
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:07,269
am so sorry, Mr. Darby.

364
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,189
The wine got the better
of me, and I just...

365
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,735
We are aware of your limitations, Tom.

366
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:17,404
And I am grateful for your patience.

367
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:21,366
Swift Enterprises is looking
for a special mineral,

368
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:22,868
which only occurs in your area,

369
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,369
for some conductivity experiments.

370
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,747
Since they're no longer in use,

371
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:30,626
could Zenzi and I perhaps
explore the drill mines?

372
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,840
Absolutely not.

373
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,690
You have got to learn to
think before you speak, Tom.

374
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:55,692
I'm sorry.

375
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,027
I couldn't help it.

376
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,820
You never can.

377
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:02,866
You wanted to talk to me about
my Tubman responsibilities?

378
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,619
I'm tired. Not tonight.

379
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:10,892
You don't belong here, Rowan.

380
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,144
- Wait, what... what's going on?
- Mrs. Swift,

381
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,496
I've been trying to reach you all day,

382
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:17,498
and your staff told me to come back.

383
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,958
I work for Congressman Eskol,

384
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,876
and he asked me to
bring you an invitation

385
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,503
to his spring fundraising dinner.

386
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,547
Mm. He makes you be a human e-vite?

387
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:28,342
Well, you thank the congressman for us

388
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,636
and tell him that we will be happy

389
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,222
to continue to support his campaign.

390
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,530
He saved my life, Isaac.

391
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:50,990
He's harmless.

392
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,867
Of course he is.

393
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:57,037
Can I talk to you about
business for a second?

394
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:03,419
I worked with Barton for ten years.

395
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:06,630
And... and now I'm spearheading

396
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,382
a new consumer-facing model

397
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:09,884
that will bring Swift Enterprises

398
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,594
into its next 50 years of dominance.

399
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:14,054
And Tom is leading the engineering.

400
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:17,141
Tom is doing wonderful
things with the company.

401
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,309
But as you said,

402
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,144
he needs guidance.

403
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:23,272
Swift Enterprises needs a
leader who is ready on day one.

404
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:26,233
So when my term as interim CEO is up,

405
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:30,488
I'd appreciate your support
in becoming permanent CEO

406
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:31,947
of Swift Enterprises.

407
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:39,789
Lorraine, I didn't mean to...

408
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,081
It's okay.

409
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,541
It's all right. It's just...

410
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,045
You're right.

411
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,964
You're right. Tom isn't ready.

412
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:53,177
He behaved so poorly
last night at dinner.

413
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,846
He insulted our guests.

414
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,727
But I can't take this away from him.

415
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,691
He's wanted this since
he was a child, and...

416
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,697
I'd break his heart.

417
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:18,077
Just like he's breaking mine.

418
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,870
I understand.

419
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,539
I'm sorry I get emotional.

420
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,625
Um, it's just I've
barely slept in weeks.

421
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,210
I think we can help you with that.

422
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:29,646
I'm sure there's something in our
pharmaceutical department that...

423
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,424
can help you get the rest you need.

424
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,135
Thank you, Claire.

425
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,846
Of course.

426
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:40,641
♪ Work, let's work, work, work... ♪

427
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,311
Want to go for a round?

428
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:46,146
Wouldn't be a fair fight.

429
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:47,940
Question...

430
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:49,668
- what's going on with Zenzi?
- She's just her usual

431
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:52,403
high-strung, rule-following,
fabulous self.

432
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:53,946
Why?

433
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,674
She's been going on about
that Chris guy since dinner.

434
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,658
- Mm.
- But she's smart.

435
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,785
She's beautiful. She's well-connected.

436
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,620
I don't see what she'd see in him.

437
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:06,000
Zenzi's weakness is Black
Harvard alums with bad lineups.

438
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,712
She sees a guy like Chris
and... she can't help herself.

439
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:12,214
They fulfill her Black
love TikTok dreams.

440
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:15,676
Meet me at Swift Enterprises, please.

441
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,428
Marked urgent.

442
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:19,346
Don't keep her waiting.

443
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,140
Got it.

444
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,272
What is this reanimated
sweater doing here?

445
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:33,569
I thought that maybe if the
two of you had a chance to talk

446
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:35,571
without your parents,

447
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:38,866
you could work something out.

448
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,427
I'm open to hearing what you
have to say if you're going

449
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:41,952
to be... reasonable.

450
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,038
See?

451
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:47,374
- He's open.
- Mm.

452
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:52,129
And I think he'd be particularly
open if you apologized...

453
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,173
For insulting his entire life.

454
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,258
Yes, Tom.

455
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,551
Apologize.

456
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:58,928
Humbly.

457
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:00,054
From the heart.

458
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,183
Nah.

459
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:06,060
I'm good.

460
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,522
Same old Tom. Emotional, as always.

461
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:13,025
Same old Chris. About to
get slapped, as always.

462
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,235
I mean, it's not my fault
you insulted my family

463
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:17,172
- when you needed a favor.
- But it is your fault

464
00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:20,199
- your breath smells like ass and hot chips.
- You know what?

465
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,868
You're just mad I dared you
in the mines ten years ago

466
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,912
and you came back crying
like a little bitch.

467
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,247
You were a coward then,

468
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,083
and you're a coward now.

469
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:32,270
I'm calling my security
and letting them know

470
00:20:32,294 --> 00:20:35,130
if you come anywhere near my family's
property again, it's your ass.

471
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:38,342
Zenzi, you're always welcome.

472
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,177
I'll text you.

473
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,443
I was at the Darby estate one summer,

474
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:59,113
bored out of my mind.

475
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:04,451
Chris was always a dick to me.

476
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:08,038
But that day, he was nice.

477
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,125
He told me that we were going to do...

478
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,752
a "man test."

479
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:19,299
Don't touch it. The
mine runoff is acidic.

480
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,884
It'll burn you up.

481
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:32,104
He told me, if I closed my eyes

482
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,481
and-and waited in there
for five minutes...

483
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:35,983
I'll come back and get you,

484
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,152
and then we can play video games.

485
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:39,862
And don't be a bitch about it.

486
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:41,613
Actually wait.

487
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:53,959
I waited for what felt like hours.

488
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,296
And Chris never came back to get me.

489
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:01,759
So I ran out and got lost.

490
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,554
I got these cuts everywhere and, uh...

491
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:08,432
burned off my right eyebrow.

492
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:12,144
Don't you remember how crazy
I looked in eighth grade?

493
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:13,520
Yeah.

494
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:15,898
You said you overshot a brow slit.

495
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,736
What did he say about it after?

496
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:25,741
He told me he did it
because I was acting too gay.

497
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:29,870
So, yeah,

498
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:32,206
I'm not exactly excited
about apologizing to Chris

499
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,124
or going back into those mines again.

500
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,126
Yeah, Tom, why didn't you tell me?

501
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,630
- I have been friends with these people...
- I am done

502
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,715
talking about this.

503
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,301
We need to get that capsule portion.

504
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,307
But how do you solve a
problem like a drill mine?

505
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,976
Barclay, have the roof rack and
the lights put on the G-Wagen.

506
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:56,230
We'll need four-wheel
drive and the winch.

507
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,003
The farthest mine entrance

508
00:22:58,004 --> 00:22:59,942
is one mile from the Darby residence

509
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:02,236
and will put you within
100 yards of the location

510
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:03,529
of the capsule piece.

511
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,905
What about the giant fence?

512
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,907
I did a little recon on the Darby estate

513
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:08,408
while y'all were having dinner.

514
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,618
It's handled.

515
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,744
We'll go in stealth.

516
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,621
That's a pretty steep fence.

517
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:14,915
This opening can only
be accessed from above.

518
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:17,417
It opens to a 50-foot vertical drop

519
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,587
and has the highest concentration
of acidic fumes and runoff.

520
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:21,839
May I suggest gloves?

521
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,801
So, I'll rappel out of the truck.

522
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,427
But what about that runoff?

523
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,139
I feel like you're gonna
need sunscreen or a wet suit.

524
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,101
I wish I still had mine, but
this is a no-heat natural.

525
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:35,780
It does not get wet.

526
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,272
Wait, do you still have
that leave-in conditioner

527
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:39,940
I made for our St. Bart's trip?

528
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,403
Ah, this leave-in is like shea butter

529
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:45,863
that did some pushups.

530
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:48,448
The synthetic bonds to
your hair and seals it.

531
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,242
If I could up the concentration...

532
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,786
Then it could seal you.

533
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:55,789
Barclay, run a polymer
sequence at a concentration

534
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:58,834
of four moles instead of .63.

535
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:03,589
At one concentration, this
polymer protects a 4B natural.

536
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,218
But at a higher concentration,

537
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,555
it's an impenetrable barrier.

538
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:15,017
How will you see through that mask?

539
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:18,145
Let's cut some eye
holes. Uh, non-starter.

540
00:24:18,187 --> 00:24:20,397
Beyoncé wore this on...

541
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,441
Fine.

542
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:23,650
May the Hive forgive me.

543
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:26,181
Which shoe, Tom?

544
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:27,807
Dior.

545
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,684
Nature, but make it fashion.

546
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:31,228
Let's go for a hike.

547
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:45,825
You might want to put these earplugs in.

548
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,831
Okay, Olivia Pope.
You said it's handled.

549
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,584
So, do you need a white
coat and some red wine,

550
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,794
or just a ladder?

551
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,380
Not exactly.

552
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:05,020
This isn't a fence, it's a system.

553
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:08,357
Cameras. Sound. Motion detectors.

554
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:09,817
I had to go through one of these

555
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:10,858
when I was in the Special Forces.

556
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,152
So, let me guess.

557
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,363
You're going to cover yourself in mud

558
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,490
to hide your body temp
from the motion sensors.

559
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,492
Oh, take out the cameras
with an infrared array

560
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:19,868
and find the kill switch?

561
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,787
Nah.

562
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,887
Did you put in your earplugs?

563
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,639
Of course I did.

564
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:43,350
Targeted the localized EMP.

565
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,245
Killed the fence's power
source in this section.

566
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:48,105
A lot easier than
covering yourself in mud.

567
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:01,076
- You shouldn't go alone.
- It's a tight fit already.

568
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:03,579
It's the only way we're
gonna make it down.

569
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,876
I've got this.

570
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,641
Call us if you need any help.

571
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,406
The suit is protecting
you from the acid.

572
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,954
Chris, where are you?!

573
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:49,082
Chris! Chris! Chris?

574
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:54,437
Oof. Ah!

575
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:57,716
Seems the acid is eating
away at that rip in your suit.

576
00:26:57,758 --> 00:27:01,887
And don't be a bitch
about it. Actually wait.

577
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,348
Ah! Ah!

578
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,225
Fix your wig, Tom.

579
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,951
Oh, crap, I'm stuck.

580
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,171
How's it going down there?

581
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:40,509
Uh, fine! Totally fine.

582
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,592
How are you?

583
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,346
You never knew about Tom in the mines?

584
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,793
Nope. My best friend let
me think everything was fine

585
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,712
so he could save face.

586
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,381
It's how we were raised.

587
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,509
All people care about it is
what will our friends say?

588
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:00,764
Everyone's just lying, and I hate it.

589
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,058
What about you?

590
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,310
Are you a liar?

591
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,815
I used to be.

592
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:16,279
Tom and I grew up the same,
but in 2008, my dad went broke

593
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,073
when the market crashed.

594
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,741
And unlike normal people,

595
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:23,620
my parents lied their
way through everything.

596
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,790
They maxed out their credit cards

597
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:30,293
on $10,000 tables at
the Tubman cotillion

598
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,462
and couldn't pay my tuition.

599
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,440
And they never let me or my
sister say a word about it

600
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,008
because they were afraid
of what people would think.

601
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,846
Uncle Barton paid for me
to stay in private school.

602
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:47,102
And Tom... has no idea.

603
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,436
So he's not the only one telling

604
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,231
a redacted version of the truth.

605
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,443
Is that why you go for guys like Chris?

606
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,654
Because they let you keep up the lie

607
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,989
your parents wanted you to tell.

608
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,866
No.

609
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,621
They make me feel like I belong.

610
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,416
Chris wants you to
think that he's the prize

611
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:12,544
and you're lucky to have
him, but someone like you

612
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,505
should never be waiting to get chosen.

613
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,717
Then why is someone
as cool as you waiting

614
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,468
to be chosen by Tom?

615
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,222
I'm-I'm stuck.

616
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,557
I need you to cut through

617
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,434
a steel beam down here.

618
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,203
There's another suit in
the back of the truck.

619
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,729
Zenzi, you'll have to do it.

620
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,897
I brought a spare just in
case intermittent fasting

621
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,065
had got me too snatched.

622
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,984
And you guys?

623
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,944
Hurry.

624
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,667
Give me the word and I'm down there.

625
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:56,671
I won't let you fall.

626
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,468
I got this.

627
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:19,360
My line is stuck and I
can't cut it to free myself.

628
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,614
Wait, did you put on
hair to come down here?

629
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,967
Oh, you're not the only one
that keeps a backup in the car.

630
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,327
This is Camille.

631
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,913
Oh, hey, Camille.

632
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,956
Camille, could you tell
Zenzi to cut this beam

633
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,249
and skip the attitude?

634
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,959
- Oh, are we skipping attitude?
- Yeah.

635
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:39,214
Will we also be skipping quips
for the remainder of the day?

636
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,437
And now you say...

637
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,815
Thank you, Zenzi.

638
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:12,372
My nanobots will latch into the
mining lanterns and give us...

639
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,417
The capsule piece.

640
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,920
Okay, let's grab this and get out.

641
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,463
Okay.

642
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,107
He added a security layer in
case someone else found it.

643
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,592
We need to disarm this or
it's going to self-destruct.

644
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,428
Okay, a raised fist and the sun.

645
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,640
Maybe the power of sunrise.

646
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,309
Okay, um...

647
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,187
Oh, oh, try "From the rising of the sun"

648
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,647
to the place where it sets,

649
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,691
"the name of the Lord is to be praised."

650
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,945
Uh...

651
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,864
Uh, your mom's birthday?

652
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,869
Oh, one attempt remaining.

653
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,829
Of course he couldn't make this easy.

654
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,591
- It had to be one of his stupid lessons.
- Look, I'm sure he thought

655
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,434
- that you would be able to...
- Would you stop?

656
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:01,629
I can be right about
my own father and Chris

657
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,631
without you poking holes
in everything that I say.

658
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,568
Yeah, well, if I had been
given all the information

659
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,552
I needed, I wouldn't
need to question you.

660
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,971
And you can't get mad at
me for asking questions

661
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,956
when you're the one
who's been keeping secrets

662
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,474
- for ten damn years.
- Oh!

663
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,643
So I'm supposed to humiliate myself

664
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,896
so you can ask me if it's true.

665
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,441
Secrets aren't always bad.

666
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,612
I know that my dad paid your tuition.

667
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,572
I never said anything because, Zenzi,

668
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,741
I didn't want you to be embarrassed.

669
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,330
Tom Swift doesn't get
bullied or called too gay.

670
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,749
And I didn't want to
be embarrassed either.

671
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,337
Well, I can't have your back
if you keep things from me.

672
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,714
Even if they are embarrassing.

673
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,513
I'm sorry.

674
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,641
Okay, look, let's just
get this capsule piece,

675
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,810
and then never speak
to the Darbys again.

676
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:02,565
Okay, a Black Power fist and the sun.

677
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:06,527
To be kept safe, um...

678
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:10,323
Wait. To be kept safe,

679
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:13,076
like the watch safe.

680
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,870
Whoo!

681
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,039
- First Black astronaut in space.
- Yes!

682
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,126
I guess my dad knew
about the missing watches.

683
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,280
I thought I told you two to
stay off my family's property.

684
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,278
Is there some jackass quota
you have to meet every day?

685
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,613
You broke in. You're stealing.

686
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,007
I could literally be
doing anything, Chris,

687
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,701
and you would still come for me.

688
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,662
I-I was... I was nice to you,

689
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:59,789
and you were a dick.

690
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:00,975
And now I'm not nice, and surprise,

691
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,959
you are still a dick.

692
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,962
You know, in the cliché
version of this story,

693
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,297
this is where the bully
reveals that he's gay.

694
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,299
So let's get to you on your knees

695
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,593
so I can get something good out of this.

696
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:16,723
That's what I thought.

697
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,559
Do you have any idea what it's like

698
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,021
to be compared to Tom Swift?

699
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:27,734
My family owns rocks.
You build rocket ships!

700
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,695
I've spent my entire life
hearing my parents say,

701
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,863
"Why can't you be more like Tom?"

702
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,410
You're... jealous.

703
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,748
Not... not no.

704
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,461
Your father was so proud of you.

705
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,839
And he left you this... this legacy.

706
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,216
I don't have that.

707
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:56,637
My dad said that he's proud of Tom?

708
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,390
Aloud?

709
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:07,190
This is our parents' mess,

710
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,358
not ours, Chris.

711
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,777
They pit us against each other,

712
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,571
and now we're just
playing out their fight.

713
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,615
We don't even know each other for real.

714
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,661
I am sorry for adding to that.

715
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,873
But we can stop it.

716
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:27,627
Look, I'll make Darby Minerals

717
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,587
an official Swift vendor.

718
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:34,383
That way we share a legacy.

719
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,738
I'm sorry about that.

720
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,490
All right, let's have dinner.

721
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,576
Next week? Soho House?

722
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,788
I can... I can sponsor you to get in.

723
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,917
I would rather trim my eyelashes

724
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,838
with a weed whacker than to
ever go to dinner with you again.

725
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,767
This is the capsule's brain.

726
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,894
The other pieces split
off, but we can find them

727
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,355
using this copper alloy signature.

728
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,442
Barclay, export.

729
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,951
Chris said that my dad was proud of me.

730
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,370
That's insane, right?

731
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:47,498
You are the only one who
could have solved that puzzle.

732
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,961
He chose you for this
because he knew that...

733
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:55,756
knows that you can bring him home.

734
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,554
And now we know exactly
where we're going.

735
00:37:01,826 --> 00:37:05,037
I'll ask Claire for some PTO.

736
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,333
Oh, and before I forget,

737
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:13,002
- here is the sleep gel we talked about.
- Oh, yes.

738
00:37:13,003 --> 00:37:15,840
I sourced a prototype from
the chem division archives.

739
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,591
It's a nitrous oxide substitute.

740
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:19,427
I tried it on myself after work.

741
00:37:19,468 --> 00:37:22,763
It resulted in the
most blissful power nap.

742
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:28,477
You apply it in places with
sensitive nerve endings.

743
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,480
- May I?
- Mm.

744
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,574
Mm.

745
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,831
Pass me your wine glass.

746
00:37:52,877 --> 00:37:55,921
You can just put it down.

747
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:57,840
I'll put it down.

748
00:37:58,632 --> 00:37:59,842
Lorraine?

749
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,178
Are you okay?

750
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,055
I did what you asked me to.

751
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,313
Set the thermostat to 65.

752
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:30,372
What's your ATM pin?

753
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,586
Uh, it's, uh, six-seven...

754
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,087
Stop.

755
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,673
No wonder the trial stalled.

756
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:42,134
The gel makes the wearer...

757
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:45,930
suggestable.

758
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:57,233
What will it take for you
to make me permanent CEO?

759
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:03,155
You will never be CEO
of Swift Enterprises.

760
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,741
I'm Barton's number two.

761
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:09,453
I've given my life to this company.

762
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,374
You're a caretaker.

763
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:17,878
Barton would never leave
our Black family's legacy

764
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,422
to someone who isn't Black.

765
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:30,891
What are you up to, Rowan?

766
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:37,273
Congressman Eskol requests
the pleasure of your company

767
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:39,858
for a private dinner on Friday.

768
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:44,905
I've never received a hand-delivered

769
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,825
dinner invitation before.

770
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:51,036
It's better than a 2:00 a.m. text.

771
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:52,830
Thank you.

772
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,930
Yes!

773
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:11,056
You did it.

774
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:13,225
You did it.

775
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:15,519
You don't sound right.

776
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,939
Show me your source code.

777
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:31,869
Isaac, I just figured out
what's wrong with Barclay.

778
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,454
It's a tracking algorithm.

779
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:36,415
It's sending all of our data
to an unknown destination.

780
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:40,209
So far it can only access incomplete
blips of video and text exchanges.

781
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,756
But if the spyware
breaches Barclay's firewall,

782
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:47,384
it can start to relay
full video and audio, too.

783
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:49,720
All right, quick, use Barclay to send me

784
00:40:49,762 --> 00:40:51,930
your protein shake recipe.

785
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,432
20 grams powder,

786
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,184
two grams sexy.

787
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:08,197
Tom, Barclay was compromised
by Eskol's body man Rowan.

788
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:10,282
I'm close, man. I can
handle this right now.

789
00:41:10,324 --> 00:41:12,910
No. Stand down.

790
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm gonna handle this a different way.

791
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,046
Hey, Rowan.

792
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:26,882
You up?

793
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
