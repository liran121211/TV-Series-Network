1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:04,062
I'm Tom Swift.
Inventor, billionaire,

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,172
shoe collector extraordinaire.

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,383
But none of that was good enough
for my dad.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,265
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,513
I could earn his love,
but his mission ended tragically.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,515
Or so I thought.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,767
Turns out it was sabotage.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,394
My father survived the attack

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,979
and sent me a message capsule

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,981
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,984
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
Now I have to find the pieces

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,779
of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,546
A global conspiracy called The Road Back
is standing in my way,

15
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,385
so I can only trust my squad:

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,953
my best friend, Zenzi,

17
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,289
my bodyguard, Isaac,
my adopted brother, Lino,

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,249
and my AI, Barclay.

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,001
Together, we're going to find my father

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
and bring him home.

21
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
Isaac.

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,267
Isaac, please stay with us.

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,477
He can't hear you.

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,230
The thallium-based toxin I detected
is causing swelling in his brain.

25
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,025
No response from
the Swift family doctor yet.

26
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,238
I am going to find an antidote
for this poison.

27
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,284
Barclay,
what did the GPS on Isaac's car say?

28
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,287
Last night, Isaac drove
to a parking garage in Flatbush,

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,776
then to his own residence at midnight
and then to Swift Manor.

30
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,580
Well, um,
could someone have poisoned him

31
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:25,946
right before he got here?

32
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,056
Not necessarily.

33
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,282
Thallium is notoriously slow.

34
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:32,092
The poisoning could have happened
any time within the last few days.

35
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,969
Or last night. Uh...

36
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,138
What was so important in Flatbush?

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,307
It was Rowan's parking structure.

38
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,188
He went to Rowan's apartment?

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,065
It was probably because Rowan's DNA

40
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,733
was on the packaging
of the capsule piece

41
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,027
- he anonymously sent.
- Wait.

42
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,814
Rowan sent the capsule piece?

43
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,903
How does Rowan know about
the capsule piece in the first place?

44
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,093
IDK, but the last person
who questioned Rowan

45
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,702
ended up with thallium poisoning.

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,956
Dr. Kay is returning your call.

47
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm an hour away. How are his vitals?

48
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,294
Blood pressure 145/95.

49
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,939
- Respiration shallow.
- Well, should we...

50
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,798
- Should we take him to the hospital?
- No.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,508
Any movement could cause a stroke.

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,135
Besides,

53
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,512
The Road Back might have people
at the hospital, too.

54
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,930
Isaac will need

55
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,473
potassium chloride and Prussian blue

56
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,315
- to flush the thallium from his body.
- Okay,

57
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,519
I can get those in the lab
at Swift Enterprises.

58
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,312
I'll see you there, Dr. Kay.

59
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:29,173
Incoming call from Quinn. Urgent.

60
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:31,334
Hey. This is not a good time,

61
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,487
- Quinn.
- I think you mean "thank you."

62
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,156
And you have a visitor.

63
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,324
Congress guy. Eskol. He's asking

64
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,685
about the Hudson
River clean energy project.

65
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,714
Wait.

66
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,950
- Is-is Rowan with him?
- If by "Rowan"

67
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:46,957
you mean "the baddie
with the earring..."

68
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,961
Hello?

69
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,338
You know, it's hard to understand

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,340
why Quinn feels so underappreciated.

71
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,010
Look, we don't have time
for Eskol right now.

72
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,928
We have to save Isaac.

73
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,097
The Hudson River project
is huge PR for us.

74
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,442
We need to go to the office
and keep up appearances.

75
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,227
Okay. Okay.

76
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,021
Um...

77
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,607
We need to put on an outfit
that says "business"

78
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,860
instead of "our friend is dying."

79
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,320
You take care of Eskol.

80
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,779
I'll go to the lab

81
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,240
and then get what we need.

82
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,700
Okay.

83
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,085
I got you. Okay?

84
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,383
Barclay, text Lino.

85
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,261
"Isaac needs you.

86
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,930
And bring Mom."

87
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,809
Tell Reverend Jones our
timetable needs to accelerate.

88
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,145
I can't say more. I...

89
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,956
I received some information
that makes me believe

90
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,149
our project is in danger.

91
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,568
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

92
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,685
Aunt Lorraine,

93
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,822
- something happened.
- Before you say anything else,

94
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,342
there are secrets being kept
in this house.

95
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,202
How long have you known
Barton was still alive?

96
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,996
Tom told me a few weeks ago.

97
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,831
I'm glad he finally told you.

98
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,250
Aren't-aren't you happy?

99
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,461
Yes, happy can't even begin
to describe it.

100
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,298
But I am afraid of what might come next

101
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,592
from the people
who wanted my husband dead.

102
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,261
That's what I came to tell you.

103
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,263
They hurt Isaac.

104
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,639
Wait, what?

105
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,182
Zenzi found him in the observatory.

106
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,935
Wait a minute. What
was Isaac doing here?

107
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,929
I let him go after the cotillion.

108
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,118
What?

109
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:35,108
Lino, he wanted to tell you himself.

110
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,986
You fired him
because he found my real mom?

111
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,738
- He was helping me!
- Angelino Kareem Swift,

112
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,950
you better take that bass out of
your voice when you speak to me.

113
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,453
I do not have to explain myself to you.

114
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,581
Did we just lose power?

115
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,918
Isaac's blood pressure is 190/130.

116
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,601
Heartbeat is abnormal.

117
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:58,464
Uh, maybe we climb up the outside wall

118
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,985
- and break in through a window?
- No. If the electricity's out,

119
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,885
the observatory becomes a panic room.

120
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,071
The windows can withstand
a missile strike, and this fire door

121
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,724
is impenetrable.

122
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,809
The lift is our only way to reach Isaac.

123
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,731
- So, if we can't open this, we are f...
- Uh, language.

124
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,858
But yes.

125

126
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,545
Hippocampus swelling has put stress

127
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,839
on the brain's memory center.

128
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:01,957
Keke's like a sister.

129
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,655
After my girlfriend, Marissa, died,

130
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,908
Keke helped me get through it.

131
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,286
But last week,

132
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,497
the cops came to break
up a party she was at,

133
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,207
and someone dropped coke in her bag.

134
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,418
She can't make bail, so she's
locked up until her hearing.

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,962
Could be months away.

136
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,507
The wind is really picking up.

137
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,051
Aah! Hold down the picnic blanket.

138
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,426
Barton! Barton Swift!

139
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,171
Barton, watch out!

140
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,489
Watch out!

141
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,402
What the hell was that?

142
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,534
Are you okay?

143
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,896
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

144
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,283
Thanks.

145
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,661
I'm Barton Swift.

146
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,496
Isaac Vega.

147
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,748
Army Ranger.

148
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,333
- Where'd you serve?
- Afghanistan.

149
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,460
Honorably discharged two years ago.

150
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,797
You ever consider being a bodyguard?

151
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,383
You know someone looking for one?

152
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,828
- How's Isaac doing?
- Getting worse.

153
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,074
Let's deal with Eskol.

154
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,932
Now, are you ghosting or busy with work?

155
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,517
I need to know for when he asks.

156
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,495
Listen, you worry about
Isaac's antidote and Rowan,

157
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,728
I'll worry about Nathan.

158
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,605
Nathan?

159
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,023
I mean Congress.

160
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,109
I mean Congressman. Eskol.

161
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,861
- Nate-Nate.
- Shut up.

162
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,529
Ah, just the man I've been looking for.

163
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,366
Nice to see you again, Tom.

164
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,909
Ms. Fullington.

165
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,204
So, uh, about that Hudson River
clean energy project.

166
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,373
My constituents
are hounding me for updates.

167
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,791
And I want in.

168
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,293
Susannah Robb.

169
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,621
- Tom Swift.
- You're looking snatched

170
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,314
and unannounced.

171
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,175
Thank you. Claire said
I should stop in here,

172
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,010
check in on things
while she's in Boston.

173
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,637
Oh... So thoughtful of her.

174
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,806
Congressman Nathan Eskol,

175
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,141
this is Susannah Robb.

176
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,642
- Hi.
- The funding genius

177
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,936
who has almost as many followers as me.

178
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,646
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

179
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,271
I appreciate what you're doing
for your district.

180
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,340
Thank you.

181
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,042
I saw your name in the public
disclosures for the energy project.

182
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,488
Speaking of that, I need to step away

183
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,490
to set up the conference room
for a meeting,

184
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,452
and I could use a hand
moving around some furniture.

185
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,245
Rowan.

186
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,165
You're... good with your hands.

187
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,083
Huh?

188
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,252
Got permission? Okay.

189
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,379
Meanwhile, my excellent colleagues

190
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,006
will update you on our progress.

191
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,674
Great.

192
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,552
If you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna take this quickly.

193
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:33,235
- Shall we?
- Absolutely.

194
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,074
Hmm. Waiting for him to text you back?

195
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,267
No.

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,686
Um, just checking on my incubator.

197
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,730
Just trying to decide
which young innovator

198
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,190
is gonna represent us

199
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,874
at the Black Tech and
Engineering Conference.

200
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,185
Yeah. And waiting
for him to text you back.

201
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,487
I get it.

202
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,715
Just remember, the good ones,
they don't leave you on read.

203
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,032
Excuse me.

204
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,659
Love the nails.

205
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,935
- Trans rights, baby.
- Very that.

206
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,038
Um, so,

207
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,557
allow me to show you
the rest of the office.

208
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,918
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Claire's office is beautiful.

209
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,299
Isaac went to ask you
why you sent that capsule piece.

210
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,002
You poisoned him.

211
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,362
Now, you're gonna fix it.

212
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,556
- Calm yourself.
- Or what?

213
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,892
Your boss will notice?

214
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,271
Maybe I should let him know
you've been playing both sides.

215
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,607
Or you can give me some answers.

216
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,901
I didn't poison anyone.

217
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,488
But from what I gathered
in Eskol's conversations this morning,

218
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,658
Isaac wasn't the target. You were.

219
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,141
Blood oxygen level below 85%.

220
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,587
- Hypoxemia warning.
- Four to six hours?

221
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,464
No, I don't care
that the entire grid is down.

222
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,300
There's someone in need...

223
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,220
He did not just hang up on me.

224
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,222
Some people don't like being yelled at.

225
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,762
Yeah, well, I wasn't yelling.
I was trying to help Isaac.

226
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:02,622
Oh, now you care about him.

227
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,805
I've always cared.

228
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,125
He was just an employee, right?

229
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,912
Ah. There she is.

230
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,748
You must be our new hire.

231
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,641
Mm. Hi, darling.

232
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,628
- Allow me to introduce my bride.
- Ah.

233
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,702
Ma'am.

234
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,674
Darling, you need to return
the book from Reverend Jones.

235
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,568
- You left it in the study.
- I... Mm.

236
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,094
Lorraine is protecting me.

237
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,556
The reverend is particular
about her lending library.

238
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,850
That she is.

239
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:48,616
Uh, headed to church?

240
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,893
- Oh, yes. Every Sunday.
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,809
You'd be welcome to join us sometime.

242
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,170
Let's just say it's not for me.

243
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,910
Okay.

244
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,953
Okay. We'll be back this afternoon.

245
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,290
In the meantime, please
acquaint yourself with our son.

246
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,542
The lift at the end of the hallway

247
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
will take you directly
to Tom's workshop.

248
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,130
He told me he's busy

249
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,842
on some kind of special
project. Confidential.

250
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,871
Tom Swift?

251
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,210
Why do you still have your clothes on?

252
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,962
I'm your new bodyguard.

253
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,044
Your full-time vibe killer has arrived.

254
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,110
Isaac Vega starts today. Whomp, whomp.

255
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,304
Another bodyguard? Okay.

256
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,888
Let's see how long this one lasts.

257
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,515
I'll be over there if you want

258
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,517
to guard my body.

259
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,312
Oh, damn.

260
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,565
Somebody stole my watch.

261
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,906
All right! All right! Party's over!

262
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,450
Yeah.

263
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,701
Come on, you got to get out.

264
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,095
- Let's go.
- Yo, who invited Stacy Adams?

265
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,246
Et tu, Parker?

266
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
Hey, hey, hey. Wh-Where y'all going?

267
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,559
Y'all, don't listen to
him. I'm Tom Swift.

268
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,376
Go on home, man. Put
some damn clothes on.

269
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,035
- It's called fashion.
- It's Sunday.

270
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,338
You should be praying
instead of twerking.

271
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,465
Bye, Rashad.

272
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,341
The hell you got on?

273
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,055
Setting aside the fact that
The Road Back wants me dead,

274
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,475
we're looking for Prussian
blue and potassium chloride

275
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,720
to help Isaac.

276
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,828
My physician says those
should flush the poison out.

277
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,563
I checked the lab's stock report,

278
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
but somehow nothing's in the lab

279
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,169
even though the inventory
was just there this morning.

280
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,821
- Barclay, get an ETA from Dr. Kay.
- I got you.

281
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,532
In the meantime, Prussian
blue and potassium chloride

282
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,909
are the best chemicals,

283
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,328
but they're not the only
ones that we can use.

284
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,288
The lab has no supplies, though.

285
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,708
Then we need to clear
out the offices instead.

286
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,670
Look inside the employees'
personal medicine cabinets.

287
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,469
Tom's been working on a
prototype called Swiftsight.

288
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,222
It will be his most
cerebral invention yet.

289
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,934
AUTOMATED
VOICE: New voice mail from Lino.

290
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,520
Hey. Isaac's getting worse,

291
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,605
and we still can't open the fire door.

292
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,774
We could really use you and Tom.
Get to Swift Manor

293
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,442
- as soon as you can.
- Ms. Fullington.

294
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,944
Could I have a moment?

295
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,028
Yeah.

296
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,033
Look, uh, the way our dinner
ended the other night was, um...

297
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,451
not ideal.

298
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,411
But I must say
that I haven't been ghosted

299
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,122
since Jane Vasquez in high school.

300
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,542
I think I like Jane.

301
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,669
Can we move past this?

302
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,963
I've always found that the second date

303
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,130
is the true barometer.

304
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,298
Your persistence is noted.

305
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
So is your hesitation.

306
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,011
Look, how can I put your mind at ease?

307
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,848
What have you been up to
these past few days?

308
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,642
Uh, Congress.

309
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,979
But I-I must say that I am skilled
at balancing work and pleasure.

310
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,107
Mm. With all your trips
outside of D.C. and New York?

311
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,609
Look, I-I conduct business
for my district when I travel,

312
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,152
but I'm seeing family.

313
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,113
I mean, I-I have a cousin in Dallas,

314
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,656
- an uncle in Portland...
- Yeah.

315
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,361
So you're visiting
family when you take trips.

316
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:31,912
Yes. Family is very important to me.

317
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,914
This world

318
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,252
doesn't value human connection
as much as it should.

319
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,641
Could I borrow Zenzi? I'm having
some issues with the presentation.

320
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,712
Her passwords are a lot
more complicated than mine.

321
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,183
Isaac's running out of time.

322
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,811
I have a plan, but I need
this building to be empty.

323
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,646
It's the middle of the workday.

324
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,982
Do I need to explain work to you again?

325
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,818
Okay, tell everyone
there's a heating emergency

326
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,612
and that they need to evacuate now.

327
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,739
Barclay, commence
Operation "Hot in Herre."

328
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,001
Temperature rising.

329
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:09,884
I am getting so hot

330
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,039
Wait till you hear him sing Ashanti.

331
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,470
Quinn. What are you doing?

332
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,697
Did you not hear the announcement?

333
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,681
The heating system is in overdrive.

334
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,683
Well, I actually kind of like it warm.

335
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,270
Uh, BT dubs, I'm totally allowed
to be in here.

336
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,316
I'm actually working on that clean
energy press release in Canva.

337
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,737
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

338
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,030
Okay.

339
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,409
Okay. Uh...

340
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,329
- Thank you.
- Yes, you're welcome.

341
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,173
Okay, Barclay. Turn the heat off.

342
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,264
Barclay, turn the heat off!

343
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,484
Somebody!

344
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,528
Quinn?!

345
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,279
Quinn!

346
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,949
Barclay, why can't you hear me?

347
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,205
Barclay!

348
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,333
Barclay!

349
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,853
Zenzi.

350
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,564
Zenzi!

351
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,315
Zenzi!

352
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,747
Can I get a doctor?

353
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,832
Need a doctor over here, please.

354
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,043
Hey. You okay?

355
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,253
Yeah, you're gonna be okay.

356
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:28,345
- All right.
- Barclay,

357
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,487
why can't we get
this temperature back to normal?

358
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:33,802
The building's thermostat
hasn't responded to my attempts.

359
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,804
It's odd.

360
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,016
We're looking for anything
that shares ingredients

361
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
with Prussian blue and
potassium chloride.

362
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,519
To create a stopgap antidote.

363
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,730
It's the best I can do
until Dr. Kay shows up.

364
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,530
Ooh!

365
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,619
Look, I can't do this
if I get a heatstroke.

366
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:04,972
Per the auto-attendant,

367
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,728
Isaac is on the brink of organ failure.

368
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,713
Hurry!

369
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,799
You've been here for two whole weeks,

370
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:58,137
and you still haven't taught
me any self-defense moves.

371
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,765
I'm dealing with the insurance claim
for your stolen watch.

372
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,119
Wouldn't it make your job easier

373
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,480
if I knew how to fight?

374
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,570
Fine.

375
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,197
Come on. Okay.

376
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,375
All right. Shift your hips to one side,

377
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,029
- giving an opening to the groin.
- Okay. Okay.

378
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:33,864
Focus.

379
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,433
Just getting my footing. That's all.

380
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,555
Now raise your opposite elbow to turn.

381
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,726
All right. And then I...

382
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,436
All right. Like this?

383
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,772
Oops.

384
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,108
Uh, no.

385
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,738
No, I don't mix work and... this.

386
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,066
Ugh. Hang on a second.
There's something in the couch.

387
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,541
Huh. I guess it wasn't stolen.

388
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,252
I must have forgotten it here
before the party.

389
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,255
- My bad.
- Seriously?

390
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,633
That watch is worth 50 Gs.

391
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,094
- I know. I bought it.
- A year's income for most people.

392
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,512
More than a year.

393
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,224
Now you're mad because I'm rich?

394
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,311
My best friend Keke is locked up
for something she didn't even do.

395
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,756
If I had 50 Gs in my couch cushions,

396
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:33,498
I could bail her out.

397
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,485
But you'll never know a pain like that.

398
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,281
Okay, you need 50?

399
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,908
Got you, bro.

400
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,286
What's your payment app?

401
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,179
I don't want your charity.

402
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,708
Okay, I think I misheard "thank you."

403
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,711
I'm just trying to be a friend.

404
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,553
From what I can tell,
you don't have friends.

405
00:20:57,578 --> 00:21:00,331
Oh, baby, my place is packed
with friends all the time.

406
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,590
And nobody gets arrested.

407
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,494
News flash. Those people
are not your friends.

408
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,813
You surround yourself with
little boys in underwear

409
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:11,673
who just want to have some free drinks,

410
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:13,825
take a picture with Tom Swift, and maybe

411
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,435
steal a few souvenirs.

412
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,881
If you had a real friend,
they'd tell you that.

413
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,034
And maybe you wouldn't be
missing so many watches.

414
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:28,984
Also, this is my notice. I quit.

415
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,220
Okay, you're overreacting.

416
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:33,831
How can I make this up?

417
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,399
Uh, what about a raise?

418
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,635
- How much?
- I'm good.

419
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,704
Come on.

420
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:42,315
Why don't we...

421
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,135
I don't know, play spades?

422
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,719
Hmm? You like spades?

423
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:49,872
We already paid you for the day.

424
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,400
This way, I get my money's worth,

425
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:57,305
and you keep your word, Mr. Vega.

426
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:03,338
Well, looks like
you and me are partners.

427
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,074
I'll tell you, I haven't
lost a game of spades

428
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,535
in 20 years, and I'm not
losing one today.

429
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,580
Please. I came out the womb
with the ace of spades

430
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,040
in my back pocket.

431
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,144
Oh, okay.

432
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,129
I'll believe it when I see it.

433
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,920
I learned to play in church.

434
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,030
Hmm.

435
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,849
And I play spades
with the wrath of hell.

436
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,686
They wouldn't let me back into church

437
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,172
if they saw me like this. Uh...

438
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,807
Are you okay playing spades
with someone like me?

439
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:36,480
The church I was raised in
didn't respect my, uh, lifestyle.

440
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,693
Well, I won't apologize for
believing in a higher power,

441
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,572
but for those who
call themselves religious

442
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,408
while using that word to exclude others,

443
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,047
to justify being transphobic...

444
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:55,242
I believe those people are
missing the point of Jesus.

445
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,867
Girl, hurry up.

446
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:01,645
Bowleggedness is not
an excuse for tardiness.

447
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,108
I know knock-knees
is not talking about me.

448
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,927
Okay, let's go.

449
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,061
Hi, I'm Zenzi.

450
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,504
Hi, I'm Isaac.

451
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,613
Hi, I'm bored.

452
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,449
- Come on.
- Let's play.

453
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,601
All right. Nice shuffle.

454
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,413
The game is spades.

455
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,595
Barclay.

456
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,107
I know you did not just play that...

457
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,109
- Learn from the best.
- Damn!

458
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,821
You just learned how to play.

459
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,364
I told you.

460
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,324
No one spades like the Swifts.

461
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,992
You all might as well just give up.

462
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,661
Me and Isaac got this in the bag.

463
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,163
Yeah, we'll see
about that, Aunt Lorraine.

464
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,793
One more game.

465
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,397
If you win, Isaac keeps the watch

466
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,090
and leaves forever.

467
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,428
If we win, Isaac keeps working for us.

468
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,728
All right, bet it. Mmm.

469
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,314
What are you bidding, Tom?

470
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,567
Six books.

471
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,405
BP 220/150.

472
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,490
Patient is in hypertensive crisis.

473
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,868
Atrial fibrillation detected.

474
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,369
Imminent risk of stroke.

475
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:18,498
Sweetheart, I know you're worried,
but the truth is...

476
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,251
The truth? Since when
is that your thing?

477
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,595
You do not speak to me that way.

478
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,623
My whole life,
you made me believe a lie.

479
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,384
You told me my mom asked you to adopt me

480
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,595
when the truth is
you took me away from her.

481
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,264
Your mother was a danger to you.

482
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,658
Now, you saw her at the cotillion.

483
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,935
Maybe if you hadn't thrown her out,
then she would be okay.

484
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,813
Okay, because...

485
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,149
because I do not want you
to hate your mother,

486
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,359
I'm going to spare you the reality

487
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,070
of how I found you
and what she did to you.

488
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,530
She owned up to her mistakes.

489
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,118
She wasn't fake and weak, like you.

490
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,980
You think it's weakness

491
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,415
that holds this family together?

492
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,169
Do you think it's weakness
that handles every aspect

493
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,088
of your pampered, privileged
and coddled life?

494
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,757
I rescued you from a situation

495
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,384
where you would have died
if I had not intervened.

496
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,303
Right. Bring on the guilt.

497
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,222
You do not understand
what I've been through.

498
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,599
You're not the only one who's in pain.

499
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,228
The love of my life, the man
who helped me to raise you

500
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,355
is dying alone,

501
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,316
and he needs you right now.

502
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,653
I need you, too.

503
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,447
You can't imagine
what it's like to be me.

504
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,785
And you can't imagine what
it's like to be me!

505
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,451
Wait.

506
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,138
I think I can.

507
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
That shouldn't have been possible.

508
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,560
Thanks.

509
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,773
Hi.

510
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,567
Hi.

511
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,694
Hi. How are you?

512
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,029
Yeah.

513
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
Thank you.

514
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,286
Hey, it's not how I pictured

515
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,123
- having my arms around you, but...
- Stop it.

516
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,959
Just...

517
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,628
You know, first you threaten me
with your bodyguards,

518
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,381
and then you literally save my life.

519
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,675
I don't... I don't know
which side you're on.

520
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,804
I don't want to be your enemy.

521
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,101
Consider this a peace offering.

522
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,479
You and I do agree on this:

523
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,400
Jesmyn Ward is, uh,
not as bleak as Richard Wright.

524
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,319
You probably already have
a copy of this,

525
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,280
but my favorite essay is
"Cracking the Code."

526
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,005
"Cracking the code..."

527
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:23,004
You're scared of losing Isaac.

528
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,809
I get that.

529
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,270
But you can invent anything.

530
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,191
So what are you gonna do?

531
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,953
My PrEP will prevent further
infection from the, uh, poison.

532
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,956
Uh, let's contain this thing
to one major organ at a time.

533
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,130
Quinn's anti-inflammatory pills
for their carpal tunnel

534
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,717
will reduce the swelling
of Isaac's hippocampus.

535
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,552
All right. Hmm.

536
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,888
Never thought I'd thank
Claire, but her ginkgo

537
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,515
will help prevent memory loss,

538
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,768
and her activated charcoal
will flush enough thallium

539
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,228
to buy us a few more hours.

540
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,730
A Hail Mary. Better than nothing.

541
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,528
This antidote is only a halfway measure.

542
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,697
Just trying to slow down the poison

543
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:20,307
while we wait for the doctor to arrive.

544
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,133
I present Swift nanobots.

545
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,260
Organic polynucleotides.

546
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,053
They fly medicine into
the nasal cavities

547
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,596
and dissolve into the bloodstream.

548
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,475
Antidotes go in the vials,
but nanobots don't come out.

549
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,894
Like a good condom.

550
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,021
What's wrong with syringes?

551
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,481
Needles? No.

552
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,000
Let's just say I don't
like anything poking me

553
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,611
that's not six-three and good-looking.

554
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,734
How tall are you?

555
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,283
Look, every minute counts,

556
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,618
so we'll have to take
the fastest car in the world.

557
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,038
Isaac's gonna wake up in a new Bugatti.

558
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,250
As for the shoe, I went with something

559
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,378
a little more old-school:
Air Jordan 12s.

560
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,630
According to Lino, MJ scored 38 points

561
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,758
with food poisoning
while he had these on.

562
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,885
And right now, we have
our own poison to handle.

563
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,012
Come on.

564
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,266
Wait, there's a huge gridlock

565
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,809
due to rush hour traffic.

566
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,019
Okay, what if we...

567
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,645
The helicopter is with Claire.

568
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,065
Per my calculations, we won't
make it to Isaac in time.

569
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,156
We won't make it in time,
but you can, Barclay.

570
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,536
Isn't that Zenzi?

571
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,246
Is she okay?

572
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,628
Go ahead, Barclay.
I'll be right behind you.

573
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,380
- What are you doing?
- I need a moment.

574
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,966
I have to go save Isaac.

575
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:05,602
What happened? Are you okay?

576
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:07,096
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm fine, I'm fine.

577
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,265
I just...

578
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,101
Aren't you gonna ask how I'm doing?

579
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,190
- I apologize for all the chaos.
- Chill.

580
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,692
Your staff did an amazing job
of showing me your work.

581
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,028
And, um, well,

582
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,323
if your inventions keep
on changing the world...

583
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,492
Swift Enterprises can be
as chaotic as you want.

584
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,372
Let Claire be the boring one.

585
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,753
Let me go. Tom gave me an order.

586
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,215
Override command Alexandra 927.

587
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,301
Administrator override accepted.

588
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,627
Barclay, it's good to see you
at full strength.

589
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,379
Go.

590
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,765
Lino, get the dome open, please.

591
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm on my final approach.

592
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,935
Barclay's flying in with the antidote.

593
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:40,023
There should be a manual release
switch somewhere around here.

594
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,192
Hey, how were you able
to open the door like that?

595
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,153
It was like you had super strength.

596
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,701
When things get intense,
my body takes over.

597
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,287
It started happening
a couple of weeks ago.

598
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,664
Well, you should have told me.

599
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,625
You had enough going on.

600
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,670
Nothing gets in the way
of me taking care of you.

601
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,422
Understand?

602
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,303
Hey.

603
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,931
I said, do you understand?

604
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,692
Yes, Aunt Lorraine.

605
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:21,303
I call you my aunt...

606
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:26,901
but you are my actual mom.

607
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:28,800
You know I know that, right?

608
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,945
I know that, baby.

609
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,781
And we're gonna figure out
what's going on with you,

610
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,248
together.

611
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,335
Incoming.

612
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:51,338
I'll reboot the power grid.
Administer the antidote.

613
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,983
Let me help. Let me help.

614
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,521
My bad.

615
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,689
It's all good, man. Knicks or Nets?

616
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,173
Knicks. Come on, now.

617
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,425
- All right.
- I'm Lino.

618
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,592
You the new bodyguard?

619
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,596
Uh, not anymore. Didn't work out.

620
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,932
I won Tom's watch
in a game of Spades, though.

621
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,852
Tom is trash at spades. Always has been.

622
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,229
Why would he bet you his watch?

623
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,986
Because he knows I'll use it
to help a friend.

624
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,739
And he knows I won't take charity.

625
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,451
Not many people can bring
out that side of Tom.

626
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,577
Just saying.

627
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,038
Isaac.

628
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,458
Stay with us.

629
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,962
Stay with us.

630
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,882
Isaac.

631
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:22,134
I'm so happy that you...

632
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,075
Welcome back.

633
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,529
Um... I'm glad that
you're feeling better.

634
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,296
I was wrong to fire you.

635
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,299
I know you were only doing
what you felt was right,

636
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,344
and after you came through for Tom

637
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,304
during his trial yesterday,

638
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,032
it just reminded me that
you're part of the family,

639
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,809
so please stay. Stay on with us.

640
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,230
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

641
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,670
How you feeling?

642
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,281
Honestly? I'm starving.

643
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,368
Let's get this soldier some dinner.

644
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,203
Yeah?

645
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,379
So, uh, are we not gonna talk about
that moment

646
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,873
you just had with Isaac?

647
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,134
Talk about what?

648
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,055
Barclay, I just ran a DNA test on my

649
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,974
stopgap antidote to find out
why it worked

650
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,560
so much better than I expected.

651
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,728
It looks like something was added.

652
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,314
I compared it to everything
in our database,

653
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,525
and the new element...

654
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,026
was Rowan's blood.

655
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,195
Sorry, Tom, I have to power down now

656
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,530
due to an override command.

657
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,658
Wh-What?! No one overrides me.

658
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,577
Rowan.

659
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,620
I saw him.

660
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,790
While I was out, I-I had
these intense memories.

661
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,959
The day I met Barton, I-I saw Rowan.

662
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,253
Watch out!

663
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,675
I don't know why he was there,

664
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,594
but it wasn't a coincidence.

665
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,113
How can you be sure that it was Rowan?

666
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,139
The medical scan showed
that the poison inflamed

667
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,767
his hippocampus;
the brain's memory center.

668
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,269
Maybe that heightened your clarity.

669
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,563
I'm just glad I remembered.

670
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,040
We should thank whoever poisoned me.

671
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,234
Oh, my God. I have a lead on that.

672
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,445
Eskol gave me this book today,

673
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,238
and I took a picture of his markings,

674
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,824
and they spell out the word "cotillion."

675
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,524
Rowan said that The Road Back
tried to poison me.

676
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:46,637
At the cotillion.

677
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,666
While I was wearing
your face filter device.

678
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,963
Can you call up the
surveillance footage from the cotillion?

679
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,051
Stop. Next angle.

680
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,931
I've seen that man before.

681
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,437
I have, too. He works for Eskol.

682
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:15,374
And The Road Back.

683
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,781
So we find this man, then what?

684
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,641
Then...

685
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,991
we get payback.

686
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,104
I was able to slow down Tom's efforts

687
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,256
by causing a power outage
at Swift Manor,

688
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,008
and we delayed his search
for the antidote chemicals.

689
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,302
But we were still not successful.

690
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,222
Turns out it's for the best.

691
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:48,195
While I was in the offices today, I

692
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,174
was able to hack into the main system.

693
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:54,480
I learned that Tom is developing
a revolutionary neurotechnology.

694
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,401
He'll be much more useful to us alive.

695
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,319
Right.

696
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,197
I also learned...

697
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,075
you've grown very fond of your crush.

698
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,705
So I engineered a little number
on the heating and lock system.

699
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,212
Which proved to me
you'd be much more focused

700
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,881
if Zenzi were out
of the picture entirely.

701
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,135
No?

702
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,616
It's the Swift's family doctor.

703
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,270
I can provide safe passage for Zenzi

704
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,605
if you reaffirm your loyalty.

705
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,071
Her life or his.

706
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,704
Your choice.

707
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,202
Okay.

708
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,455
We're good.
