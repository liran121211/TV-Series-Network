1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:03,878
I'm Tom Swift. Inventor, billionaire,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,006
shoe collector extraordinaire.

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,299
But none of that was good enough
for my dad.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,260
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

5
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,221
I could earn his love, but
his mission ended tragically.

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,225
Or so I thought.
Turns out, it was sabotage.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,060
My father survived the attack,

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,812
and sent me a message capsule

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,814
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,734
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,569
Now I have to find

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,094
the pieces of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,414
A global conspiracy called The
Road Back is standing in my way.

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,511
So I can only trust my squad...
my best friend, Zenzi,

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,162
my bodyguard, Isaac,

16
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:41,399
my adopted brother, Lino,
and my AI, Barclay.

17
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:44,844
Together we're going to find
my father and bring him home.

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,632
Let's review.

19
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,177
Capsule piece retrieval mission
number three.

20
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,638
This time, no detours, kidnappings,

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,766
or rogue dates...

22
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,226
so we can rescue my dad
before The Road Back discovers

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,519
he's still alive.

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,271
He sent me a message capsule.

25
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,315
And the capsule exploded
in the atmosphere.

26
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,900
And once we reassemble it...

27
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,110
We can decipher the message
and rescue Barton.

28
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,737
We've got this, boss.

29
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,655
Scheduled touchdown: 1500.

30
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,083
In Utah's Snow Canyon State Park.

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,158
Look at us.

32
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,786
We are getting the hang of this.

33
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,141
Duh.

34
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,764
Incoming call from Usurper.

35
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,333
Hello, Tom.

36
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,752
Your access to the Swift Jet
has been revoked.

37
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,795
You can't ground me.

38
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,464
You don't have any authority.

39
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,508
No, but Lorraine Swift does.

40
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,468
What?

41
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,470
Why did business affairs

42
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,945
notify me you approved
a Swift spa resort

43
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,778
in Langstonville, Oklahoma?

44
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:41,893
Oh.

45
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,479
It's actually a funny story...

46
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,146
Our investors disagree.

47
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,982
Since the Saturn disaster, our stock

48
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,984
has plummeted. Now I'm fielding calls

49
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,362
asking if we're sinking millions
into travel wellness.

50
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,355
- Mm.
- What am I supposed to say, Tom?

51
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,823
That Oklahoma is the new Tulum?

52
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,258
Look, it might take a few years...

53
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:02,872
"Years"? The company is struggling now.

54
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,124
You're a mess.

55
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,751
You need a wake-up call.

56
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,214
And maybe losing your title
and resources will achieve that.

57
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,092
I'm suspending you from your
position at Swift Enterprises.

58
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,496
What?! I am working
on something right now.

59
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,565
I need access to the...

60
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,643
It's for the best.

61
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,353
Not everyone has a mind for business.

62
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,732
Then let me learn.

63
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,404
Not my old job.

64
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,945
Entry level.

65
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,739
Let me work my way up
and earn my old job back.

66
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,449
Hmm?

67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,204
If you're serious...

68
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,203
I'll see you tomorrow.

69
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:46,521
7:00 a.m.

70
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:49,341
Sharp.

71
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,722

- <font color="#0080ff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

72
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,566
Going to see Bio-Mom.

73
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,484
Don't be mad.

74
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,252
How do you know where she is?

75
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,612
Wait for me.

76
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,869
We need to finalize
the Tubman Group Cotillion plans.

77
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,398
Pastor, it has been difficult.

78
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:29,709
- Barton loved the cotillion.
- Yes.

79
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,879
This will be the first year
in 25 he isn't by my side.

80
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,256
The thought of being
at this celebration,

81
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,019
and then looking over
at his empty chair...

82
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,635
Mm.

83
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,678
I can attend cotillion with you.

84
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,805
So you can abandon me halfway through?

85
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,020
Why don't I leave you to talk?

86
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,487
These past few weeks
have been the hardest

87
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,697
our family has ever faced.

88
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,493
And every time I've needed you,
you disappear.

89
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,027
I don't know, maybe I did
something wrong raising you.

90
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:07,247
No.

91
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,250
I am so sorry.

92
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,416
I know that I've been distracted lately.

93
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,171
But I'll be there.

94
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:17,827
I promise.

95
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:19,687
By your side,

96
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,719
all night.

97
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,805
I hope so.

98
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:37,367
We said we'd talk with Lorraine first.

99
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,002
How did you even find her?

100
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:40,238
You said Newburgh.

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,490
I googled "Newburgh treatment facility."

102
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,098
I keep seeing weird things,

103
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,959
like my senses are bending.

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,001
Aunt Lorraine said
my mom used to see things.

105
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,169
Maybe she can help.

106
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,432
Well, you've got the Swift
flair for the dramatic.

107
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:59,899
Actually, it's a
distinctly Warren trait.

108
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:04,304
Barton wouldn't know
flair if you fired it up his ass.

109
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,476
Lino?

110
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,087
Oh, my Lino.

111
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,198
Oh!

112
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,026
You have such an appetite.

113
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,404
There's a great Ethiopian
restaurant nearby.

114
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,990
You can leave here?

115
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,075
I'm not a prisoner.

116
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,204
I-I just keep a room here for when...

117
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,206
I need... rest.

118
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,917
How come you never came to see me?

119
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,837
I never stopped wanting to.

120
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,682
But Lorraine, my sister,
she craves control.

121
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:44,726
And when I wouldn't submit,
she hit me with

122
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,863
- a restraining order.
- "A restraining order"?

123
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,327
One turbulent episode years ago,
she lost it,

124
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:52,448
using my setbacks against me.

125
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,990
Can I be here? I-I don't want
to get you in trouble.

126
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,731
You approached me.

127
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,192
So it's fine.

128
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,236
And your cotillion

129
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,406
means you're nearly... grown.

130
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,159
So Lorraine should let you
make your own decisions.

131
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:13,880
Lino, isn't there
something you wanted to ask?

132
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,417
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

133
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,212
This is gonna sound weird.

134
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,756
But when I get stressed,

135
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,133
it's like I feel energy around me.

136
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,303
Electricity crackling through things.

137
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,639
Has that ever happened to you?

138
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,391
It hasn't.

139
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,268
But it sounds...

140
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,437
beautiful.

141
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,399
There's nothing wrong with you.

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,275
You and I, we just...

143
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,611
we just deal with stress differently.

144
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,156
When I get overwhelmed when
I'm around too many people,

145
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,784
or in an unfamiliar place, I, um...

146
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,340
I calm myself by picturing

147
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,287
a setting that-that's peaceful.

148
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,751
Like...

149
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,628
this garden.

150
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,297
Can I, can I show you
a breathing exercise?

151
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,177
You trace your finger up

152
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,096
as you breathe in, and then...

153
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,046
down the other side as you breathe out.

154
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,282
In... out.

155
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,260
You don't get stressed?

156
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,867
Come see me again.

157
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,327
We need to loop in Lorraine.

158
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,038
I would love...

159
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,125
to be part of your life, Lino.

160
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,671
Hello.

161
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,631
It's my first day in the bullpen. I'm...

162
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,467
Tom Swift. I know.

163
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,968
Everyone knows.

164
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,095
I'm Quinn, Claire's assistant.

165
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
We've met multiple times.

166
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,393
Okay.

167
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,978
Your first assignment:

168
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,272
copy-edit blurbs
for your latest products

169
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,952
so I can import them into Canva

170
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:06,027
for Claire's investor presentation.

171
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,695
Cool.

172
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,322
But...

173
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,741
I'm a world-changing inventor.

174
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,493
This...

175
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,970
just feels like a waste of my talents.

176
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,580
Yeah, that's kind of what working is.

177
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,373
Zenzi, hey!

178
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,875
Girl.

179
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,002
What? Um, we were looking for somebody

180
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,379
- who enjoyed copy-editing and...
- Okay, well...

181
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,048
I thought of you.

182
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,817
You know I never
thought I'd see the day that

183
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,053
Tom Swift would have
to fix comma splices.

184
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,721
Comma...

185
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,279
spli-splices. I know what those are.

186
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,409
See, this is what happens
when you let Barclay complete

187
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,941
your MIT writing requirement.

188
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,106
Just... it'll be faster

189
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,417
- if I start it off for you.
- Okay.

190
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,109
Ah, ah, ah, careful.

191
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,404
Claire didn't want you just
falling back on Zenzi.

192
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,590
- How is Claire gonna know...?
- Zenzi!

193
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,074
Ooh! Mm-mm!

194
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,534
A word?

195
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,122
Tom's suspension has created
a power vacuum.

196
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,752
I'm in the market for someone to mentor.

197
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,881
You and I can lead SE into a new era.

198
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,342
I'm offering you a big step up.

199
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,719
Yeah, I can't stab Tom in the back.

200
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,401
He's been in the bullpen
for five minutes,

201
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,100
and already asking you to do his work.

202
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,802
You can't shine if you're always
cleaning up after someone else.

203
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,523
My offer expires in 24 hours.

204
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,943
You can go.

205
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,032
Okay.

206
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,826
There's something in the mailroom.

207
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,287
Unless it's Rome Flynn gift
wrapped, why are you telling me?

208
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,784
You asked for all
of Tom's mail to be monitored.

209
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,458
X-ray flagged a strange package
with a message written on it.

210
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,128
"Urgent. Tom, I believe
this belongs to you."

211
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,338
No return address.

212
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,716
Bring it to me.

213
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,510
Capsule piece scanners have found

214
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,512
a signature inside the building.

215
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,639
Inside the building?

216
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,897
Hacking into Swift security...

217
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:30,203
Claire has a capsule piece.

218
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,304
Got your morning chai.

219
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,975
- What's that?
- An anonymous package.

220
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,560
It has the same copper alloy used

221
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,187
on Barton's spacecraft, but...

222
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,147
I don't recognize the design.

223
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,358
Do you, Tom?

224
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:53,397
Uh... let me see it.

225
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,698
It's just some vintage Swift tech

226
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,734
- that I ordered.
- Oh.

227
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,827
It's my personal property, Claire.

228
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:06,103
It's a piece of unknown technology
that came addressed to the company.

229
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,393
Dr. Wilson...
please run a diagnostics check on that.

230
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:13,836
Yeah, sure.

231
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,968
That's lukewarm.

232
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,096
Try again.

233
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,225
Oh, you look so handsome.

234
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,893
Even if you won't cut your hair.

235
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm looking forward
to our mother-son dance.

236
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,735
Since it is rite of passage or whatever,

237
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,530
um, could my mom come?

238
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,910
Violet is not part of our family.

239
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,538
I'm old enough to decide...
Angelino Kareem Swift.

240
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,625
Your, uh, bow tie is too loose.

241
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,961
Thank you.

242
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,464
And while you're here...

243
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,758
You are a Swift now, and you deserve

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,177
to look fabulous. Look at that.

245
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,096
Thank you.

246
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,060
Why would someone mail us
a capsule piece?

247
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,104
Maybe it's some kind of trap.

248
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,898
Mm. We can solve that later. Right now,

249
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,608
we need to get it back from Claire's

250
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,445
poorly manicured clutches.

251
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,281
Meet the CEO vault.

252
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,992
Nine inches of reinforced steel

253
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,453
only accessible
from my dad's old office.

254
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,413
Designed by yours truly.

255
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,248
I'll disable the cameras,

256
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,750
bypass the biometric security,

257
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,209
and lift the capsule piece.

258
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,627
All on a Sunday.

259
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,045
Why the rush?

260
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,672
Claire recognized the outer casing

261
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,665
as the same unique alloy
used on Barton's spaceship.

262
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,777
Her head of tech is
already investigating.

263
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,637
Wilson's gonna find a creation timestamp

264
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,639
is dated after my dad's ship exploded.

265
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,069
Meaning they'll see it was created

266
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,762
after Barton supposedly died.

267
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:51,747
Anyone discovers
that my dad is still alive,

268
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:54,105
it's only a matter of time
before The Road Back finds out.

269
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,489
You two need to keep Claire

270
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:56,991
and Lorraine busy at the cotillion,

271
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,534
while I go get heisty with it.

272
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,202
"The cotillion"? So we're just gonna

273
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,580
conveniently forget
my past with the uppity

274
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,166
and myopic excuse
for Dubois' Talented Tenth?

275
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,710
They dropped me
like last year's outlet rejects

276
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,253
when my parents lost their money.

277
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:12,548
Those debutantes gossiped...

278
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,425
and spread rumors.

279
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,141
And Regina Jackson?

280
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,654
May her ankles ever be ashy!

281
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,264
Stole my escort.

282
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,308
It was hell.

283
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,978
This... is to save my dad.

284
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,690
Please?

285
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:32,443
Hmm? Okay!

286
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,528
That sounds like a yes sigh. Good, um...

287
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,697
let's prepare a vault heist, shall we?

288
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,021
Message from Quinn: "Where are you?"

289
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:41,469
"It's 3:00 p.m.
People still work at 3:00 p.m.

290
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:43,589
Unsure if you're aware."

291
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,324
Crap.

292
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:49,317
Do jobs just expect you
to be available at all times?

293
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,966
But I finished all my work
for today, so...

294
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:58,636
Yeah, that is the fun thing about work.

295
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:00,930
There is always more.

296
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:05,409
Looks like Claire lost
her reading glasses again.

297
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,354
50th time today.

298
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,940
A purse full of backups?

299
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,938
You must be really good at your job.

300
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,752
Yeah, tragically good.

301
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:16,695
You know, I...

302
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:19,615
joined Swift to be a
concept artist, but I was told

303
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:22,243
I had to "pay my dues"
as Claire's assistant first.

304
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:25,162
That was four years,

305
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:27,832
one week and... two days ago.

306
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:30,167
And I'm still handing out glasses

307
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,356
instead of improving designs.

308
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,549
Improving my company designs?

309
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,465
- Yes.
- Okay.

310
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:39,343
Show me what you got.

311
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,097
Come on.

312
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,432
Okay.

313
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,895
Your AR Monovision.

314
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,562
If you change the component

315
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:51,355
from a solid lens to a liquid polymer,

316
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,370
you could apply it
to windows, windshields

317
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:57,153
for an AR experience anywhere.

318
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:01,546
This is tremendously good... Q.

319
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,926
- No.
- Okay, no, uh...

320
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,786
- Q-dawg?
- No! No!

321
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,872
Okay, look, I feel like

322
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:10,583
you do not like me very much
and I don't know why.

323
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,794
Take out your phone.

324
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,673
Come on, take out your phone,
tweet something like, uh...

325
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,675
"Boring day at Swift Enterprises.

326
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:21,844
Got to shake things up."

327
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:25,931
And...

328
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:27,016
He posted.

329
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:29,268
Code Tom! Code Tom!

330
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,570
You spout off and
Swift stock dips three points.

331
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,692
Suddenly budgets are slashed,

332
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,430
projects are shelved,

333
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,754
contractors are laid off.

334
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,241
There are real consequences and

335
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:46,660
you don't even realize it.

336
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,958
Aw, crap!

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,085
Okay, I just... I got to go handle

338
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,755
some cotillion stuff, but... Yeah.

339
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,925
I appreciate you.

340
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,261
Thank you.

341
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,430
Quinn.

342
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:11,268
Mission: save my relationship
with my mom,

343
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,897
while heisting the capsule piece
to save the life of my dad.

344
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,524
Claire limited my company access

345
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,944
to only inventions
I've written copy for.

346
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:22,947
Swift Lush Nanocream and AR Monovision.

347
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:26,575
But I have other inventions
I can draw from.

348
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,954
What car, Tom?

349
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,790
Hmm, the red Corvette.

350
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:36,353
A beast to race from cotillion
to Swift Enterprises. What shoe?

351
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,145
Uh, black leather ankle boots.

352
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,674
Perfect for both cotillions and crime.

353
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,300
While I'm breaking into the CEO vault,

354
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,303
I need both of you at the cotillion.

355
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,472
Isaac, you'll wear the Insta-Tom.

356
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:51,475
Conceived after too many
New Year's Eve invites.

357
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, yes, back in the day,

358
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,105
I had to be in five places
at one time without losing

359
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,564
links in my hoe-tation.

360
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:01,026
It'll project
a hologram of my face onto your body

361
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,487
and mimic my voice. Hmm?

362
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,447
I had a nightmare like this once.

363
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,615
Ooh, forgot to turn
the voice function on.

364
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,136
This is my nightmare, too.

365
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,038
Lorraine will know I'm not you.

366
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,481
Just stay in her line of sight.

367
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,966
I'll be back in 45 minutes,

368
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,701
just in time for Lino's debut.

369
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,935
We have two days to prep, okay?

370
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,472
Haven't been able to tell
Lorraine about Violet yet.

371
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,165
Be patient.

372
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:33,684
No one cares what I want.

373
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,222
Hello.

374
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,725
Rolling Meadows Extended Care.

375
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:17,561
I'd like to speak
to Violet Warren, please.

376
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,271
Please hold.

377
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:28,505
Black cotillions are a
tradition that spans back a century.

378
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,482
A rite of passage for our young people

379
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,495
to celebrate their beauty,

380
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:38,040
their legacy, and their accomplishments.

381
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,587
You're here.

382
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,672
I owe Claire $20.

383
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:48,935
Oh, I came just in time
to witness that entrance.

384
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,095
You could give lessons.

385
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:54,473
You think Naomi Campbell created
her walk all by herself?

386
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:00,646
She looks about
as happy as a child being dragged

387
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,648
to a ten-hour braid appointment.

388
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,542
You know, if you really want
to help me tonight,

389
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,444
you can convince Zenzi to give
the debutantes a pep talk.

390
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:09,446
She keeps turning me down.

391
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,365
I don't think I'm the right...

392
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:13,826
Lino. Who's this

393
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,744
dapper young man?

394
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,655
We'd love to have you out
to the Oak Bluffs this summer.

395
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,993
You'd love the house... our view
of the harbor is unmatched.

396
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,801
Especially since the $2 million

397
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:33,137
- renovation we just finished.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

398
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,806
- Mm. Oh.
- Your favorite.

399
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:38,100
Champagne punch?

400
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:39,810
Uh, mm-hmm. With Grand Marnier.

401
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:41,979
- Just like at the Conservation Gala.
- Mmm!

402
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,231
Speaking of...

403
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:45,732
have you considered donating

404
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,568
to the Vineyard's Conservation Project?

405
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,696
They're three million short.

406
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:53,115
Sounds like you have that
in the couch cushions.

407
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:55,659
Well, it's not that extensive
a renovation.

408
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:58,120
And we're barely there.

409
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,166
Mm...

410
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:03,950
I saw Dad do that.

411
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,669
Anytime somebody wanted to flex,

412
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:08,046
he'd redirect to see what's
really in that bank account.

413
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,174
Hmm.

414
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,509
My grandparents said we can
meet our future husbands

415
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:15,053
tonight... but my escort is
aggressively basic.

416
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,514
Oh, you owe me, Tom.

417
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:19,850
Hi. Hello. I'm Zenzi.

418
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:23,901
Uh, Mrs. Swift asked me to come
in here and check in on you ladies.

419
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:25,956
Let me guess, you're here
to tell us how important

420
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,983
cotillion is to our futures?

421
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,736
A teenager masking
vulnerability with sarcasm.

422
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:32,905
How novel.

423
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,865
Sorry.

424
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:37,951
Uh, these things just make me
a little combative.

425
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:39,995
I was tricked into being here.

426
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,164
I'm one of the scholarship winners.

427
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,458
Only accepting money means dressing

428
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,211
up as Tyler Perry's production
of The Nutcracker.

429
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:50,214
Listen, just remember that...

430
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:54,932
you were chosen
because of your talent and intelligence.

431
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:59,348
This is not
the be-all end-all they make out to be.

432
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,981
Zenzi Fullington.

433
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:05,076
If it wasn't for that same fivehead,
I might not have recognized you.

434
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,122
Sounds like you don't think
cotillion is important.

435
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:09,316
Regina Jackson.

436
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,194
Because... of course.

437
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,029
I was simply explaining

438
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:16,073
that the cotillion
doesn't have to dictate

439
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,158
your entire life.

440
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,118
Then why do girls like you

441
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,412
whine about being left out?

442
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:25,165
What you pretend is "elitism"
is actually just having

443
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:28,502
high standards, but I guess
that's hard for the Swift

444
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,212
charity case to understand.

445
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:34,049
Zenzi's escort dropped her
in high school.

446
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,885
And her ex-boyfriend Marcus
just did the same thing.

447
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,137
She never makes the cut.

448
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,266
So you see, girls,

449
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:44,768
what happens at cotillion

450
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,563
does impact the rest of your life.

451
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,345
Zenzi? Oh, are you all right?

452
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,040
- Come on, I'm about to leave.
- Just give me a second.

453
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,345
- I need a second.
- No, no, Claire is here now.

454
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,682
I don't have time to play "guess
Zenzi's crisis" right now.

455
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,624
Can you just think
about somebody else, please,

456
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,126
for just one second, okay?

457
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,253
Regina Jackson is here.

458
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,589
- And she just...
- So what? Listen.

459
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,966
I'm trying to save my dad,
and you're upset

460
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,969
that mocha Rachel McAdams
hurt your feelings.

461
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,637
Girl, prioritize.

462
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,323
Do you know that every
one of your feelings

463
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:23,807
becomes my top priority, okay?

464
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,285
You should be just
as mad at her as I am.

465
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,727
Why aren't you pissed?

466
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,895
- Why aren't we keying her car?
- Okay.

467
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,939
Okay, listen.

468
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:33,525
What is the quickest way to
solve this unremarkable drama,

469
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,837
- so that we can get back...?
- Did you just call me "unremarkable"?

470
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,821
"Unremarkable"?

471
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:39,906
If that's true, then why
do you need me so much?

472
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:41,325
Huh? To copy edit?

473
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,118
To-to help you pull off this heist?

474
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,370
You think I'm lost without you?

475
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:52,295
Look, I invented an engine that
sent the first human to Saturn.

476
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:54,438
I literally change the world.

477
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:56,840
Thousands of scholarship winners

478
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,800
could change the world if they had

479
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,510
the resources you have.

480
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:03,722
You are not remarkable, Tom.

481
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,183
You're just rich.

482
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:21,502
Let's put on the Insta-Tom.
You will be fine.

483
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,342
- Same tux.
- Different body.

484
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,078
- Comparable body.
- Sure.

485
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,163
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

486
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,956
You can't get the device wet.

487
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,423
Hey, move.

488
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:40,550
Activate voice mimicking.

489
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,891
Please tell me you're not
entranced by your own face.

490
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,976
Guess you'll never know.

491
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,145
Off to the capsule heist.

492
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:08,412
Next guard sweep is
in three minutes, Tom.

493
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,039
Okay, Nanocream should mimic

494
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:14,000
the last fingerprint pattern.

495
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:43,286
Next, iris and vocal recognition.

496
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,831
Claire Cormier.

497
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:49,411
I've never been more basic.

498
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,288
Input security code.

499
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,290
"Security code"?

500
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,876
The vault doesn't have a security code.

501
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,728
Diagnostics indicate

502
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:04,781
the keypad has been recently added
by Claire.

503
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,945
Does everyone grope this boy?

504
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:40,189
Tom. Tom, hi, darling...

505
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,752
Listen, sweetheart, I wanted to...

506
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:46,008
You changed your tie.

507
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,868
Oh. Um.

508
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,811
You know, well, um...

509
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,848
Cardi B says you haven't made it

510
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,642
until you have seven outfit changes.

511
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,936
Oh. And, uh, oh, and this one looks

512
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:57,861
- a lot better in the spotlight.
- Yes.

513
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,981
- Mm-hmm.
- Listen.

514
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:02,359
I've been hard on you lately.

515
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,279
But I-it's only because I love you.

516
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,657
I have every faith that you can reach

517
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,700
your highest potential.

518
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,371
I will always be in your corner.

519
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,414
Okay?

520
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:19,717
There's nothing you can do
to make me love you less.

521
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,882
Uh, sometimes
I don't realize how luck...

522
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,468
I forget how lucky I am to have

523
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,095
a mom like you.

524
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,349
Um...

525
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,393
um, I, um...

526
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:38,270
I'll be right back.

527
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,355
Okay.

528
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:43,817
Message from Isaac: "S.O.S."

529
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,428
"Insta-Tom broken. Your mom's alone.

530
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:47,654
Get back!"

531
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:49,239
Uh, crap!

532
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:51,199
Uh, text Zenzi!

533
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:55,078
Zenzi has blocked you across all
modes of communication. Even Linkedln.

534
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,080
Mm. Savage.

535
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:58,915
Uh, look, I can't get
this wiring, Barclay.

536
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:00,750
I-I need the tools from my old office.

537
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,502
Your old office is unavailable.

538
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:04,546
Are you concerned that Zenzi's

539
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:09,259
assessment of you being nothing
without your resources is accurate?

540
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,635
30 seconds

541
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,721
until guard sweep.

542
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,072
We caught him in your office, ma'am.

543
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,785
Wouldn't it have been easier

544
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:38,496
to just... I don't know, Tom...

545
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,957
Tell me what it is?

546
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,501
It's a piece of my father's spaceship.

547
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,962
I believe it might be the black box

548
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:48,256
with his last words on it.

549
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,467
Well, how do you access it?

550
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,555
If you hold down
the green transmission button

551
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,724
and the gray power control,
it should activate.

552
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,645
Now, please...

553
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:03,229
let me examine it.

554
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:09,986
Your newfound humility is refreshing,
Tom.

555
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:12,478
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Claire, don't...

556
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:19,162
Claire Cormier.

557
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,200
This is Barton Swift.

558
00:28:57,242 --> 00:29:00,120
My will is to be amended
so that my wife, Lorraine,

559
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:02,372
and my son, Thomas, receive

560
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:04,833
an equal split of Swift Enterprises.

561
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,210
Lorraine...

562
00:29:07,252 --> 00:29:10,672
I know you will guide Tom
to be my successor.

563
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,507
"Successor"?

564
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,510
To my wife... my love,

565
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,345
my everything.

566
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,848
I need to say...

567
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,249
The data was corrupted.

568
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,001
The device, like, disintegrated

569
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:49,586
- in my hands.
- No.

570
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,046
You did something to it.

571
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:53,006
I know it.

572
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,842
If I were you, Tom,

573
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,219
I would hurry back to the cotillion.

574
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,722
Don't worry.

575
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:02,849
I won't tell your mother about this.

576
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:07,771
I wouldn't want to disappoint
her more than you already have.

577
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,376
There you are.

578
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:32,605
I thought you disappeared right
before the mother-son dance.

579
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,172
Lino's up.

580
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:36,966
Escorting Ms. Damon

581
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:41,346
is Mr. Angelino Kareem Swift.

582
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,477
Captain of the water polo team,

583
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,146
the lacrosse team and...

584
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:52,524
the track team.

585
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,405
Presented by...

586
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:04,160
Presented by...

587
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:07,580
Ms. Violet Warren.

588
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,089
I'm surprised to see her.

589
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:18,049
Yes, it's Lorraine's sister.

590
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:20,218
Wasn't she committed?

591
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,191
Don't you worry about her.

592
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,760
Hmm?

593
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,976
The parents will now join

594
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:30,728
their children in a waltz.

595
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:50,456
Violet...

596
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,294
- Look at her.
- Violet...

597
00:31:55,587 --> 00:31:57,088
What's wrong with her?

598
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:00,425
Violet.

599
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,135
Look. Look.

600
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,761
So many people...

601
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,098
- Violet...
- Look at her.

602
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,643
What's wrong with her?

603
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:14,480
Mom, what's wrong?

604
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,143
Get away!

605
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,629
- Mom, you're hurting me.
- You can't have him!

606
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,810
- He's my son!
- Violet, listen to me, listen to me.

607
00:32:21,835 --> 00:32:24,004
You need to let Lino go.

608
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:26,367
- Let him go.
- Get away!

609
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,372
I keep the light safe.

610
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,458
I keep the light safe!

611
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:36,878
They're trying to torture me.
They're trying to torture me!

612
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,635
They're trying to torture
me because I'm special.

613
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,508
And I, I protect the light.

614
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,150
Tom, we need to get her someplace safe.

615
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,885
She said the garden was a safe place.

616
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:45,178
Mom, imagine a garden.

617
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,554
Auntie Vi, look at me!

618
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:48,223
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey.

619
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:49,974
Hey, shh, listen.

620
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,893
Look at this new invention I created.

621
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:54,520
Huh? Want to put that on?

622
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:56,648
Okay. Hmm? Okay?

623
00:32:58,024 --> 00:32:59,943
I am right here.

624
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:01,945
Oh...

625
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:04,447
Oh...

626
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,402
Oh...

627
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:09,347
Oh. Oh!

628
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:12,247
Tom, what did you do?

629
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,499
I brought her to a virtual garden.

630
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:21,130
Lino?

631
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,717
How did she get here?

632
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,968
I'm sorry.

633
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:41,786
I was trying to help.

634
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,654
Lino is going through a hard time.

635
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:47,532
A boy needs his mother.

636
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:50,034
Do you know how I got custody of Lino?

637
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,162
Child Protective Services called me,

638
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:54,998
asking if I had been in contact

639
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,292
with Violet. No one had seen her

640
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,419
or Lino for weeks.

641
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:03,923
I raced over to their house
and I found him all alone.

642
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,593
He'd been living off
of old peanut butter,

643
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:10,471
half the size of a
normal three-year-old.

644
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:13,266
Covered in bruises...

645
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:14,684
burns.

646
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:16,436
I took him in.

647
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:19,521
I raised him.

648
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:23,025
I love him.

649
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:25,278
I am his mother.

650
00:34:28,614 --> 00:34:30,616
Barton hired you to protect us.

651
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:32,702
And tonight, you brought harm

652
00:34:32,744 --> 00:34:34,619
- to our doorstep.
- Mrs. Swift...

653
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:38,098
Effective immediately, you are no
longer an employee of this household.

654
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:53,878
I am so sorry.

655
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:58,237
You have visions because
you are an experiment.

656
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:03,358
You are the light.

657
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:15,536
When she was first diagnosed
with schizophrenia,

658
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,538
right before she graduated high school,

659
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,832
we tried to get her help.

660
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:22,794
But she couldn't see she had a problem.

661
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:24,666
Refused the medication.

662
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,689
So the best I could do
was to donate a wing

663
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:28,073
to a treatment facility

664
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:30,610
so that they'd always
keep a bed open for her.

665
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:33,429
I was trying to protect Lino

666
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:35,515
by keeping them apart
until he could understand.

667
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:38,309
- I am sorry. I wish I could...
- No, honey, listen.

668
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:39,680
You were wonderful.

669
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,458
Your... your invention.

670
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:45,066
Your brilliance.

671
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,444
You saved the day.

672
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:54,409
Maybe I was too harsh
about your suspension.

673
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,536
You showed great leadership tonight.

674
00:35:56,577 --> 00:36:00,498
But I've been careless of my actions
and how they affect others.

675
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,500
Tonight doesn't make up for that.

676
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,419
That is the maturity

677
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,212
that I've always wanted to see.

678
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:12,468
I'm reinstating you
to your previous position.

679
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:14,971
We need you.

680
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:18,224
Oh!

681
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:20,893
Thank you.

682
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:26,107
Oh, uh, Claire's assistant,

683
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:28,985
Quinn, could I promote them to R&D?

684
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:31,779
They have some very useful ideas.

685
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:34,282
All right.

686
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,202
Oh, no. No, no, no.

687
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:39,954
Honey, everyone will stare.

688
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:41,372
- I can't...
- Come on.

689
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:44,375
That walk deserves
another entrance moment.

690
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:47,128
And everybody's always staring.

691
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,255
We're Swifts.

692
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:56,929
After you.

693
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:23,456
My, my, my.

694
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:26,209
How far the Swifts have fallen.

695
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,544
You really haven't changed
since high school.

696
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,463
Retinoids and Botox.

697
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:33,549
No, I mean that you're still
so miserable that you delight

698
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:35,259
in others' misfortune.

699
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:37,261
You know, I'm happy to be a Swift

700
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:41,516
charity case, because they only support
promising ideas.

701
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,601
Who's supporting your Botox,

702
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:48,712
Regina?

703
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:56,739
And I'd up that Botox dosage.

704
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,158
You're looking a little creased.

705
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:04,914
Maybe...

706
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:07,625
I was wrong tonight.

707
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,210
Look, if being at the cotillion

708
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:12,922
hurts this much for you,
then I need to respect it.

709
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:16,717
Sorry I pushed you, sis.

710
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,805
I'm sorry, too.

711
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,726
You are remarkable.

712
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:28,437
Oh.

713
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:31,482
Claire asked me if I wanted a promotion.

714
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:33,317
I turned her down.

715
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,320
- Because of me? Oh, that is not my...
- Oh, no, mm-mm.

716
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:39,115
Because I don't want to work
for anyone else anymore.

717
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:44,495
Yeah, I'm starting
a tech incubator at Swift Enterprises.

718
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:47,672
To identify up-and-coming inventors

719
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:52,160
who haven't had all the
same opportunities as...

720
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:55,965
Yeah, it'll be a new frontier

721
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:58,134
in Swift innovation.

722
00:38:58,175 --> 00:38:59,969
And I'm gonna run it.

723
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,721
And Claire said yes.

724
00:39:01,762 --> 00:39:03,681
Oh.

725
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,141
Sounds great, Zenzi.

726
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,684
- Mm.
- I approve.

727
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,772
I wasn't asking

728
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:14,483
for your permission.

729
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:17,361
Mm-hmm.

730
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,830
Barclay?

731
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:29,957
Where are we with uploading
the capsule piece data?

732
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,001
100% complete.

733
00:39:32,043 --> 00:39:34,462
We have all the data from
the destroyed capsule piece.

734
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,970
25 seconds!

735
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,017
Barclay, this is the liquid

736
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,961
AR Monovision prototype.

737
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:52,747
Upload a decaying version of Dad's video

738
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:55,816
to the polymer as I'm spraying
it onto Claire's glasses.

739
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:00,696
The video will play when
she activates the capsule piece.

740
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:03,491
Replace the audio with the following.

741
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:07,244
This is Barton Swift.

742
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,288
My will is to be amended
so that my wife,

743
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,540
Lorraine, and my son, Thomas,

744
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:14,794
receive an equal split
of Swift enterprises.

745
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,962
Lorraine...

746
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,215
I know you will guide Tom

747
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:21,022
to be my successor.

748
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:23,611
To my wife, my love,

749
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:26,472
my everything...

750
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,417
Zenzi.

751
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,252
Lorraine fired me.

752
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:58,963
I was the one that helped
Lino find Violet and...

753
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:00,923
It's all my fault.

754
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:04,343
I'm looking for Tom right now,
but I haven't been able to find him.

755
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:24,071
Whoa! No!

756
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,032
What are you doing?! Ah!

757
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:28,784
- Get the watch!
- Let go of me. Ah!

758
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:30,494
Get the legs.

759
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,793
Let me go!

760
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:42,526
Let me out of here!

761
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,042
