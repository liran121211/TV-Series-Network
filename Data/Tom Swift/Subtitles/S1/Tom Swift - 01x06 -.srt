1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:04,086
I'm Tom Swift, inventor, billionaire,

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,006
shoe collector extraordinaire.

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,299
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,902
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,720
I could earn his love.

6
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,265
But his mission ended
tragically, or so I thought.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,851
Turns out it was sabotage.

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,520
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,814
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

10
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,812
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

11
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:28,319
Now, I have to find
the pieces of that capsule

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,030
and reassemble my dad's message.

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,198
A global conspiracy called The Road Back

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,702
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad:

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,121
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

16
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,249
my adopted brother Lino,
and my A.I. Barclay.

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,711
Together, we're going to find my father
and bring him home.

18
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,343
What's up? It's Tom. Text me.

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,846
Hey. Hey, it's me again.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,140
I'm sure by now
your mother has informed you

21
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,017
of my, uh, dismissal.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,102
But I'd really like to explain.

You weren't answering your phone.

That's because being
your own hype woman takes focus.

35
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,200
I found Tom's watch on the
ground next to his Corvette.

36
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,981
The side mirror was broken,
and there was a handprint on the window.

37
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,775
You do know he's meticulous
about his vehicles.

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,960
I think Tom's in trouble.

39
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,088
Oh, I can't do nothing without him

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,881
getting in my way!

41
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,092
You know what? He better be dead,

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,970
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill him.

43
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,472
Lorraine won't be happy to see me here.

44
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,808
Don't worry, she's
detoxing from the cotillion

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,570
in Martha's Vineyard.

46
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,772
Barclay, where's Tom?

47
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,484
Powering up now.

48
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,862
Hey, we're gonna find him.

49
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,363
You haven't let anyone down.

50
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,699
Since when does Barclay
need time to power up?

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,369
Tom is late for his
8:00 a.m. cycling class

52
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,954
with Sir Cody Rigsby.

53
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,087
Tom never misses Cody.

54
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:47,781
Locate his phone, please.

55
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,267
Locating. Barclay, run an analysis

56
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,147
on this handprint I just sent you.

57
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,721
You have been released
from your security duties.

58
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,509
Request denied.

59
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,063
Barclay, just run the print.

60
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,180
- Yes, Zenzi.
- Unbelievable.

61
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,933
The handprint belongs to Tom.

62
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,437
Tom would never leave
a handprint on a Corvette.

63
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,981
Wh... When did you last see him?

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,858
Just after 7:00 p.m.

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,860
I was still looking for him at 7:50 p.m.

66
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,339
when I left you a voice mail.

67
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:19,160
7:46 was is I took
my electromagnetic pulse nap.

68
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,702
Tom wouldn't expose Barclay
to an electromagnetic pulse.

69
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,204
Too harsh.

70
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,414
And it would damage memory access.

71
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,493
Barclay,

72
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,854
what did you see just
before taking that nap?

73
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,006
Technically, I didn't see anything.

74
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:34,325
Swift Manor security cameras did.

75
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,144
As Tom was leaving the cotillion,

76
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,088
I heard a car screech to a halt.

77
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,642
I then heard Tom grunting
and breathing heavily

78
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,859
before his pulse accelerated to 146 BPM.

79
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,496
That's when I was hit with an EMP.

80
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,996
From that moment on, I was in
sleep mode till you woke me.

81
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,438
Barclay, engage side-ho protocol.

82
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,376
- Engaging.
- What?

83
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,737
It's basically when you give
a spare key to a side-ho

84
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,462
so they can just pop in whenever
no one else is around.

85
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,029
Basically, you and I will both be able

86
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,282
to access Barclay on our devices
while we look for Tom.

87
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:06,613
Might I add there's still the matter
of capsule piece number four.

88
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,498
Tom was unable to retrieve it yesterday

89
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:10,233
due to the Swift jet being grounded.

90
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,677
No, we can't save Barton without Tom.

91
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:14,178
It'll have to wait.

92
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,581
- Yeah.
- Triangulation complete.

93
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:19,275
Tom's phone is located in 82 locations
across the state of New York.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,936
The signal's been cloned
and scattered to throw us off.

95
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,730
Who would have the resources to do that?

96
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,487
Where did The Road Back take Tom?

97
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,447
This is the last time
you put your hands on me.

98
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:34,540
Where is he?

99
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,651
The Road Back did not kidnap Tom.

100
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:39,537
If they had, I would have
been the one to do it,

101
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,289
but I didn't.

102
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,792
Boy, what the hell do you have on?

103
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,128
Ass-whuppin' clothes.

104
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,729
You want to try them?

105
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,590
How are you so sure
he's been taken and not

106
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,170
just off being Tom?

107
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,655
There's video.

108
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:57,531
- I'll help you find him.
- Nah. No, you're not...

109
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,223
Tom's my assignment.

110
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,184
I've been instructed to observe him.

111
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:02,727
Observe for what?

112
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,770
Who instructed you? The congressman?

113
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,398
That's no longer an issue
if he's been taken.

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,275
If I've lost him, I'm in more trouble

115
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,152
than either of you can imagine.

116
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,906
Rowan did save
Tom's life during our SCIF mission.

117
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,575
Look, we have no reason
not to trust him right now.

118
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,829
Do you really want
to deny help finding Tom?

119
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,707
Fine.

120
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:27,543
But if The Road Back didn't kidnap Tom,

121
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:28,794
then who the hell did?

122
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:10,419
What the hell is this ungodly thing?

123
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,374
Hello?

124
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,233
"Invent the power
your freedom requires."

125
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,485
Or what?

126
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,093
Oh.

127
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,596
Death.

128
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:51,106
Synced and corrected by <font color="#ff0000">synk</font>
<font color="#0080ff">(www.addic7ed.com)</font>

129
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:58,801
This is where I had my

130
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,696
last active interface location with Tom.

131
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:02,936
Retrieving backup memory now to replace

132
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:05,534
the 12% I lost in last night's EMP.

133
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,232
Then I can go back to helping people

134
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:09,497
who actually are Swift employees.

135
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,415
Barclay... and I get that

136
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,417
when you're out of
the Swift family, you're out...

137
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,919
But you and I are good, right?

138
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,254
No exceptions. Still processing.

139
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,753
Backup retrieved, memory complete.

140
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:22,614
This is where Tom accessed
the last capsule piece.

141
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,474
And where Claire destroyed it.

142
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,543
She what?

143
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,058
If Claire destroyed the
capsule piece last night,

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,728
then it was probably taken to
the incinerator this morning.

145
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:34,728
Barclay said that even though Claire

146
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,066
destroyed the physical capsule piece,

147
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:39,252
Tom was able to retrieve
the information that was on it.

148
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,862
Whoever sent that capsule piece
was probably watching him

149
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:43,743
long enough to know that he wanted it.

150
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,367
I mean, they were probably watching
when he was kidnapped.

151
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,119
Or maybe they're the kidnapper?

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,996
Either way, I didn't find
any relevant information

153
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,082
on the Swift Enterprises
security cameras

154
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,025
or in Tom's files.

155
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,337
Finding out who sent that capsule piece
is our only lead.

156
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,131
I'll see if I can scan it before...

157
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,294
Excuse me.

158
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,196
Can one of you show me the ransom note?

159
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,973
Maybe I can analyze it.

160
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,792
There wasn't a ransom note.

161
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,975
Neither of you found that odd?

162
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,644
The kidnappers must want something.

163
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,193
Unless...

164
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,238
Unless their plan is to kill Tom.

165
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,584
No. We must have just overlooked

166
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,903
the ransom note at Swift Manor.

167
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:26,282
Rowan and I will head back
while you and Barclay

168
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,325
check the incinerator for evidence.

169
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:37,585
All right, make a working
cell phone battery

170
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:41,046
out of impossible parts.

171
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,149
Do you just want money?

172
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,821
Guess not.

173
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,793
Okay.

174
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,420
Maybe I can charge the phone using...

175
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,056
Okay. That is not the answer.

176
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,602
Focus, Tom.

177
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:49,949
I don't have access to
all of my usual tech, but...

178
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,789
how about access to yours?

179
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,833
You told me to use
everything in front of me.

180
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,003
That camera is in front of me.

181
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,923
And so are all of its parts.

182
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,638
Ah... ha!

183
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,661
Right.

184
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,542
Static electricity from my body

185
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:43,669
should be able to...

186
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,338
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

187
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,717
Ah!

188
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,046
We appreciate your participation, Tom.

189
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,398
My name is Garrett.

190
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,818
This is the woman whose life
is now in your hands.

191
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,404
She's currently trapped
in a confined space

192
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,239
and running out of oxygen.

193
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:15,701
You are free to go if you wish,

194
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,325
but she will die.

195
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,014
Or you can stay, complete your trials,

196
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,207
and save her life.

197
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:24,847
The choice is yours.

198
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,713
Why are you doing this?

199
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,759
How do I know she's even real?

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,011
Do it.

201
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,685
Please!

202
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,115
Please, someone help me!

203
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,558
Fine!

204
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm in.

205
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,064
Then I suggest you work fast

206
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,690
because the game has now begun.

207
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,576
Your goal is to pass

208
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,720
through this obstacle course

209
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,829
and obtain the flag
without getting a drop of paint

210
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,665
on your clothing.

211
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,833
In addition, you must not run
outside of the marked perimeter.

212
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:10,714
Friendly reminder, a woman's
life is in your hands.

213
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,883
Can anyone hear me?

214
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,177
Please, help!

215
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:18,639
The woman's
oxygen is running out quickly.

216
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,016
Your time begins... now.

217
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,405
He did mention paint.

218
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,044
What the hell is going on?

219
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:52,464
How did someone break in here
while we were gone?

220
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:55,634
Whoever did this
wanted us to know they were here.

221
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:59,680
Uh... This-this is... This is, this...

222
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,765
What happened?

223
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,559
I don't know. I don't know.

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,937
Barclay, did the security
cameras catch who did this?

225
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,181
They did not.

226
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,457
All security cameras
seem to have been disabled.

227
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,025
How...

228
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,461
Are you okay?

229
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,155
Stress.

230
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,781
I'll be fine.

231
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,324
Right.

232
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:22,870
Well, shall we commence
searching for a ransom note?

233
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,833
Hey, uh, were you able
to scan the capsule piece

234
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,293
before it was incinerated?

235
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,336
Yeah, yeah.
Barclay's running an analysis

236
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:32,880
- on it now.
- Okay.

237
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,675
Zenzi, any chance Tom's A.I.
can scan this shoeprint?

238
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,069
The dirt, as well.

239
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,929
Barclay?

240
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:42,639
I'm on it.

241
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,354
Decomposed specialized granite.

242
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:51,023
Production of this particular granite

243
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,902
halted in the early 1990s.

244
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,027
Narrowing down former
warehouse locations.

245
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,445
Stand by for an address.

246
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:58,781
What if the kidnappers
were searching for

247
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:00,532
a specific Swift technology?

248
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:02,951
If we figure out what they took,

249
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:05,245
we might be able to
figure out who took it,

250
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,830
and who took Tom.

251
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,499
You see anything missing?

252
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,960
It's hard to tell.

253
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,255
I would say his smartwatch, but

254
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,800
he was wearing that,
and Isaac found it this morning.

255
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,637
He was also wearing
his, uh, power-down ring.

256
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:22,805
You think he still is?

257
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,306
What's a power-down ring?

258
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:26,809
Tom invented it to power
down paparazzi cameras

259
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,627
'cause they never got his good side.

260
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:31,201
But if his kidnappers
left the ring on him,

261
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:34,759
he could weaken electronics of theirs.

262
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:42,491
If I cheat, they kill us.

263
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,369
Right?

264
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,800
Maybe eighth time's the charm.

265
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,845
Of course.

the top and the bottom,

they'll travel farther.

273
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:43,093
Okay, based on the spray pattern
and velocity,

274
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,678

You've completed the trial.

296
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,359

Tom!

301
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,220
Oh, God, Tom!

302
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,247
What is this? What is this?

303
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:14,952
- Could be an antidote to revive him.
- Or something to kill him.

304
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,521
You better not die.

305
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:30,325
Are you okay?

306
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,077
I feel like a million bucks.

307
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:36,164
So I've been better.

308
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,791
How did you know it was safe?

309
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,794
Well, I got a five in AP Chem.

310
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,841
That's the compound for epinephrine.

311
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:49,052
He's had worse things inside him.

312
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:54,725
Sorry I wasn't there.

313
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,185
Well, you're here now.

314
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:04,568
You come to kill me or kiss me?

315
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,903
You're alive, aren't you?

316
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,948
Well, I'll pucker up later.

317
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,701
Let's move. Come on.

318
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,257
Were they Road Back?

319
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,437
Never said who they were
or what they wanted,

320
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,173
but I'm pretty sure
they're holding a woman, too.

321
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,675
Off grounds. We have to go save her.

322
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,677
You were just kidnapped
and tranquilized.

323
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,179
Okay? We need to get you some rest.

324
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,836
You need to tell
Aunt Lorraine what happened.

325
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,988
My mom has enough on her plate.

326
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,519
As for shaking off tranquilizers...

327
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,192
It's like you don't remember Vegas.

328
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,195
Whole life forever. Come on, y'all.

329
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,155
Uh, wait...

330
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,702
We can look for the hostage.

331
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,410
You should head to Utah, at least.

332
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:57,245
Get the next capsule piece.

333
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:59,592
We'll lose Uncle Barton if you don't.

334
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,475
Dad's got months of oxygen left.

335
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,127
This woman, she only has minutes of it.

336
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,469
I can't just let them kill her.

337
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:07,159
How do you know they won't
kill you this time?

338
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,559
'Cause I got you now.

339
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:12,837
And two very passionate Black
men who like saving my life.

340
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,501
- Which means we're heading north.
- Why?

341
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,641
Because these digits have been glitching

342
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:19,017
for the last three minutes.

343
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,356
I think they're forming coordinates.

344
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,312
Put this into your GPS.

345
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,231
Yeah, but what's going on
with that countdown?

346
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,192
I think it's how much time she has left.

347
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,152
15 minutes.

348
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,322
Well, our ETA is looking like 20.

349
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,616
You know what I say about ETAs.

350
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:36,326
They never hold up to your surname.

351
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,662
Barclay, open.

352
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,510
Ah. This is more like it.

353
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,014
Think I have time for a new wardrobe.

354
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,725
This is literally a matter
of life and death.

355
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,336
You're still stopping to change?

356
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,187
I never said we were stopping.

357
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,401
I call it my GO-BAGG.

358
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,028
Or, the ground-operated
backseat apparatus

359
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,738
for gear and garments.

360
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,701
Upgraded my Lambo after I went
too hard in Provincetown,

361
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:20,495
and only remembered
I had a funeral the day of.

362
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:24,374
Would not recommend speeding
past state troopers in a thong.

363
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,944
You know what?

364
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,409
I'm pretty sure that's what got
me out of that ticket, though.

365
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,893
Are those...

366
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,853
Are those the Prying Eyes?

367
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,414
I thought they only offered
search results

368
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,648
for whoever you were ogling.

369
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,069
Okay, these have helped
me avoid relationships

370
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,239
and hook-ups with tons of married men.

371
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,241
And they should help with Garrett, too.

372
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:02,038
Next time I see him,
I'm going to read him

373
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:04,274
for the filth that he is.

374
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,976
And as for these,
the leather's just a vibe check.

375
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,587
Took me 20 years to dress how I feel.

376
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,590
And right now...

377
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,134
your boy's feeling tough as hell.

378
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,311
Trial or rescue mission?

379
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:29,814
If it's the former, are we sure
backup's allowed?

380
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,733
Garrett left a syringe for you.

381
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,568
He's anticipating reinforcements.

382
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,448
Human or... otherwise.

383
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,242
Hey, Barclay.

384
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,785
Tom, it's so good to...

385
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,536
Wait, is that a second watch?

386
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:46,957
Oh, trust me, this poly
situation is temporary.

387
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,125
I'm sure I'm not the first to hear that.

388
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,544
Ooh, good to see you, too.

389
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,431
This is where we're supposed to be.

390
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,539
Barclay.

391
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,060
Side-ho, here's what I got.

392
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,081
Trace evidence
on the capsule package was

393
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:10,438
a DNA match to Rowan.

394
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,399
You good?

395
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:16,111
Barclay, keep those results
confidential for now.

396
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:35,672
Tom, slow down.

397
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,590
She can barely breathe.

398
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,945
I think it's a... a vagina room.

399
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,948
Oh, mm, straying from your
strongest area, then.

400
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,283
Mm-kay.

401
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,118
Okay, um...

402
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,163
What if I misunderstood the countdown?

403
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:11,082
What if I'm too late?

404
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:13,543
Please comply with weapons check.

405
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,868
First: Swift, Tom.

406
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,978
Second: Fullington, Zenzi.

407
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,626
I have to get to her
before she suffocates.

408
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,314
- Tom! Tom!
- Tom!

409
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,991
The monitors, please.

410
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,246
Since your trials began,
we've slowly pumped nitrogen

411
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:54,626
into Room One, which is sealed,
much like Room Two.

412
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,094
Listen...

413
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,887
whatever you want with me...

414
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,640
Say "Room One," and oxygen
will fill the room

415
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,266
to save that woman.

416
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,310
But nitrogen will fill the other

417
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:14,437
and kill your friends.

418
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,899
Say "Room Two,"
and the reverse will happen.

419
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:21,361
If you choose neither room,
nitrogen will fill both.

420
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,279
You have ten seconds.

421
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,407
Which room gets the oxygen?

422
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:43,839
Three, two...

423
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:46,033
Room One.

424
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,956
As a courtesy, you
now have intercom privileges.

425
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:59,233
We appreciate your participation.

426
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:04,654
Ma'am? Are you okay?

427
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,202
Guys, I got eyes on you.

428
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:13,580
Poison is flowing through the vent.

429
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,971
I-I think the five minutes
on the countdown are for you.

430
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,083
Now,

431
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,877
we are going to figure this out.

432
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:20,211
I'll cover the vent.

433
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:22,088
Okay. Search the room.

434
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,175
Tell me everything you find,
ordinary or not.

435
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,348
Uh, I see a speculum and-and a...

436
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,893
- A what?
- Oh, to be a cisgender man. Barclay,

437
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:38,813
please look up a list of
common OB-GYN tools for Tom.

438
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:40,857
Loading.

439
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,075
- Rowan!
- I'm fine.

440
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,287
This wall is softer than the others.

441
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,414
Some kind of weaker composite.

442
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,208
Okay, well, maybe it's more breakable.

443
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,711
Brilliant. Um, let's try something.

444
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,425
Move a foot to your left and

445
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,719
ram the wall with your shoulder.

446
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,226
Okay, the barrier to the room is thin.

447
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,436
If you can create an opening for it,

448
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:20,230
we can get enough oxygen to you. Um...

449
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,606
We just need a drill.

450
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:23,669
I'm not seeing a drill.

451
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:26,155
You're gonna invent one.

452
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:30,990
Rowan,

453
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:32,450
take that stool to the wall

454
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:34,244
and turn it around, all right?

455
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,205
Uh, and Zenzi and Isaac,
grab the speculum

456
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:39,958
and a T-shaped screw that's
shaped like a wine opener.

457
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,626
Then I want you to use the medical tape

458
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:44,420
to enclose the speculum bill
around the screw.

459
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,305
Now, fasten the speculum to

460
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:56,724
the underside of the stem, face up.

461
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,619
Then I want you to take
the chair legs to the wall

462
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,603
and turn the seat like a wheel.

463
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,081
Hold on. Bring it down,
bring it down, bring it down.

464
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:04,399
Yeah, just like that.

465
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,818
Okay.

466
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:10,280
All right.

467
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,948
As you open a hole in the wall,

468
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,285
the balance of nitrogen
and oxygen will even out.

469
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,039
Okay. Okay, uh...

470
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,243
inhale and hold it now.

471
00:28:35,388 --> 00:28:37,974
No, that's...
You should have enough air.

472
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,978
Oh, we're good. We're through.

473
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:45,940
Isaac!

474
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:09,669
For the record, this is my second
life or death vagina room.

475
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:12,629
Girl, it's like you don't even
remember Vegas.

476
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,980
No. No, no, no! No!

477
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:27,815
No!

478
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,861
Ma'am.

479
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,071
More bad news.

480
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:34,405
The Utah capsule has gone dark.

481
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,735
We've lost it.

482
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,470
Oh, no.

483
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:03,393
Mom? Mom?!

484
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,811
Lino?

485
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,855
Is everyone...

486
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,527
Welcome home, Tom.

487
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,244
Put your glasses on.

488
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,501
Prying eyes activated.

489
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:35,508
After Tulsa,
we tried to protect ourselves.

490
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:40,012
Garvey and his pan-Africanists,

491
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:43,015
the Leaders of
the Black Freedom Movement.

492
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,107
Rustin.

493
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,901
Parks.

494
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:01,784
From the SCLC to SNCC

495
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:06,581
to the Panthers, we tried.

496
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:09,167
And in doing so,

497
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,044
we went through trials of our own.

498
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:16,090
Picked ourselves up,
built something new.

499
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,636
We weren't as public as others,

500
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,222
but we funded movements.

501
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,726
Mutual aid, bail.

502
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:29,228
Scholarships.

503
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,067
We learned hard lessons.

504
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:46,287
But everything we did

505
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,790
led to you.

506
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,682
According to these shades,

507
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,810
you're dead, Garrett.

508
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,732
And for your sake,
my friends better not be.

509
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:17,985
We're getting your friends help.

510
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,199
But right now... I need yours.

511
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,302
Mom?

512
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:38,064
You stole my face filter prototype

513
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,957
and made some adjustments,

514
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:44,400
I see.

515
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,307
Where are my friends?

516
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:51,435
They're being given top medical care.

517
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:53,688
They'll wake up in their cars
in a few hours.

518
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:57,567
Mm. So now they matter to you?

519
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:01,279
The company you keep will matter
more than ever now.

520
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,489
It's why I pushed Justin toward you.

521
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,199
I wanted you to have worthy confidantes

522
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,534
for what's coming.

523
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:09,078
But it seems you already
chose good ones.

524
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,081
So you were testing them, too.

525
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:16,252
They pounced on the soil sample
we left in the observatory.

526
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,921
Raced right into danger for you.

527
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,965
Zenzi, especially, kept her head

528
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:23,092
when others were losing theirs.

529
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,596
You counted on her recalling
the epinephrine compound?

530
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,472
Mom, I was 12 the last time
I needed one.

531
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:31,142
And yet she stepped up,
as did the others,

532
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:33,227
during the final trial.

533
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,396
And because you were able
to count on your friends,

534
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,690
you were able to save that woman, too.

535
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,277
Except you staged it all.

536
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,196
Why?

537
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:51,954
You know the Tubman group
for its cotillions.

538
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,457
But there's a sub-group within it.

539
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,417
We kept it secret.

540
00:33:57,043 --> 00:34:01,297
Since Tulsa, a select group
of Black Americans,

541
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,675
including your grandfather,
worked to amass

542
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:07,261
concentrated and undetected wealth.

543
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,098
They aimed to form a society

544
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,725
untainted by white supremacy.

545
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:17,562
Like a safe space.

546
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,983
We've been thinking outer space.

547
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,736
A planet of our own.

548
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:27,865
The idea came to us 27 years ago.

549
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,827
Your father was at a conference...

550
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,039
and I was six months pregnant.

551
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,667
Alexandra came early.

552
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,211
I had a sister?

553
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:43,109
Your father tried to race home.

554
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,966
And when I called 911,
I was in so much pain

555
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:47,676
I could barely think.

556
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:52,555
Help! Please!

557
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,475
Please, someone help me!

558
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:07,071
That was you?

559
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,160
I was alone and in premature labor.

560
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:16,163
And after, I was so afraid

561
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:19,917
that once I saw a doctor,
I trusted him completely.

562
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:22,962
His name was Dr. Garrett.

563
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,382
He dismissed my symptoms
of gestational diabetes

564
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,052
that he should have diagnosed;
symptoms I told him about.

565
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,055
And because he ignored me,

566
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,016
I never saw your sister open her eyes.

567
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:39,353
Hypoxia.

568
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:46,402
Running out of air in a contained space.

569
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,490
She was a stillborn.

570
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,242
Yes.

571
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,286
Due to the diabetes.

572
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:58,164
And you were all alone.

573
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:01,000
Not entirely.

574
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:04,045
They did let me hold her at the end.

575
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:12,386
Mom...

576
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,808
I am so sorry.

577
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,977
I had no idea.

578
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,605
For a long time,

579
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:26,734
I didn't know how many other Black women

580
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:29,695
had similar stories
about their doctors...

581
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,449
or how this system hurts all of us.

582
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,951
Which is why your father
dreamt of a new home

583
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,912
for Black people.

584
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:40,748
We call it the Mountaintop Station.

585
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,710
And you want me to join it?

586
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:46,796
No, Tom.

587
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,090
We want you to build it.

588
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:53,135
And Swift Enterprises is
its only chance at funding.

589
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,138
You see, I-I was afraid
that if you couldn't handle

590
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,099
being CEO, this was beyond you.

591
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,267
Okay, then why bring me in now?

592
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,520
You were there for my sister.

593
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:05,606
Hey, shh, listen.

594
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:07,858
Look at this little invention
I created, huh?

595
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,194
Wanna put that on?

596
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,780
You looked out for Quinn.

597
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,074
Claire's assistant, Quinn.

598
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,243
Can I promote them to R&D?

599
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:19,620
They have some very useful ideas.

600
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,165
You owned up to everything.

601
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,293
Maybe I was too harsh
about your suspension.

602
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,504
You showed great leadership tonight.

603
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,549
But I've been careless of my actions
and how they affect others.

604
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,342
Just like the man I knew you were.

605
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:44,520
And frankly, our timetable
has been accelerated.

606
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,106
Look, we're no CIA, but we know
people are looking into us.

607
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:50,693
And after the-the brutal,
one-sided police response

608
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,028
to protest in 2020, some of us believe

609
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,239
that the Mountaintop Station
was overdue.

610
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:58,075
Okay. Then why didn't you
just tell me about it?

611
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:00,202
If I treated you any differently

612
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,288
than any other recruit,
they wouldn't let you in.

613
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:03,998
You all had to go through

614
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,375
torture-porn-hell-week back there?

615
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,627
Well, some form of it.

616
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:11,881
To communicate the Tubman principles,

617
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,758
and to see which candidates
embodied them.

618
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:18,053
Your first trial,

619
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,889
it took after our mantra.

620
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,932
"Invent the power

621
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:24,768
your freedom requires."
Your freedom requires.

622
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,731
And the second was a test of integrity.

623
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:30,983
And you never used your ring.

624
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:34,069
So you knew what it could do.

625
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,821
Well, we leave cheat items

626
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,907
on the person of every candidate.

627
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,783
As for the third trial,

628
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:42,578
we needed to know that
you'd help the collective,

629
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,581
even at the risk of personal cost.

630
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,042
The woman you saw on the gurney
is from the Tubman Group,

631
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,002
and she's okay, don't worry.

632
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:52,213
But we did monitor
the safety of your friends,

633
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:54,131
down to the laser intensity.

634
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,884
The nitrogen was diluted.

635
00:38:57,426 --> 00:39:00,262
But Rowan's lungs were
more contaminated than usual

636
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,680
for someone his age.

637
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:04,308
We would have resuscitated him
if Isaac hadn't.

638
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,227
So send our apologies.

639
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:10,022
So I can talk to them about all this?

640
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:14,610
Well, I'd like to have
a private discussion with Isaac,

641
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,029
but he and the others are approved.

642
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,387
That is, if you'll join us.

643
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:21,075
I'm in. I'm in.

644
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,744
Well, I am proud to have you.

645
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:28,707
But, Tom, the group operates
solely on trust.

646
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:32,294
And I've-I've played my part
in the lack of it between us.

647
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,796
I've shielded you...

648
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:35,965
For more than I ever knew.

649
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:38,300
You told me that after I missed

650
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,177
the dedication of Dad's memorial.

651
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:42,596
Because I hadn't realized

652
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,765
