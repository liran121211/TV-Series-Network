1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,379
I'm Tom Swift... Inventor, billionaire,

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,548
shoe collector extraordinaire,

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,842
but none of that
was good enough for my dad.

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,802
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,763
I could earn his love, but
his mission ended tragically.

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:18,143
Or so I thought.
Turns out, it was sabotage.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,561
My father survived the attack

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,438
and sent me a message capsule

9
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,314
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,401
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

11
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,944
Now I have to find the pieces

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,308
of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

13
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,158
A global conspiracy called
"The Road Back"

14
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,702
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad...

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,996
My best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,879
my adopted brother Lino

17
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:41,594
and my AI, Barclay.

18
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,960
Together, we're going to find my father

19
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,670
and bring him home.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,099
Oh.

21
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,394
Okay.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,731
- You good?
- No. Um,

23
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,374
last night, after I severed all

24
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,699
of Barclay's network connections
from Swift Enterprises,

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,961
I discovered that the spyware
Rowan used is a hybrid Trojan.

26
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:20,705
My security
protocols are being chipped away.

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,957
I'm at 90%.

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,126
You should've let me handle
Rowan last night.

29
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,128
He's giving intel to Congressman Eskol.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,031
But instead, you texted "You up?"

31
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,925
as if you two matched on a dating app.

32
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,844
Okay, for Barclay's sake,
you better hope that Rowan swipes right.

33
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,514
Look, there is
a bigger problem right now.

34
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,829
How do I stop this spyware
before it reaches 100%,

35
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:42,856
and all of Barclay's data
becomes accessible

36
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,643
to the people who tried to kill my dad?

37
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,049
Can't you just reinstall
Barclay's database?

38
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,154
No. It's not that simple.

39
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,741
Look, Barclay is an AI, but he's...

40
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:53,443
He's my memory.

41
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:56,986
If I wiped and rebooted him, he
would never come back the same.

42
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,596
Thank you, Isaac.

43
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:01,766
Your suggestion
to give me a lobotomy is noted.

44
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:05,566
But if Barclay's defenses
go to zero percent,

45
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,760
they'll be able
to track the capsule pieces.

46
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,479
If he's breached, they'll know
my father is alive,

47
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,981
and they will come back

48
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:13,983
to finish the job
before we can save him.

49
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:17,403
We have to stop that breach.

50
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:29,859
Synced and corrected by <font color="#ff0000">synk</font>
<font color="#0080ff">(www.addic7ed.com)</font>

51
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,334
The opponent's got Swift backing up.

52
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:33,919
He lunges. Swift parries.

53
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,463
And now Swift is on the offensive.

54
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:38,007
Nobody has touched Swift all day.

55
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,509
Swift retreats.

56
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,636
Now he lunges. Swift parries and scores.

57
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:46,307
That's 14 straight points.
One more, and Swift wins.

58
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:48,601
Yes, Lino!

59
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:06,035
Man, he scored 14 in a row.

60
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:07,870
This is match point.

61
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,706
Will Swift's opponent be the
first to land a touch on him?

62
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:13,042
- Tom? Tom?
- Ah.

63
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,660
It's Lino's final tryout.

64
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,688
He's on the cusp of setting
a record for no touches,

65
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,214
and you're missing it.

66
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,632
- Oh. Sorry.
- Here we go.

67
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:21,095
They're going back and forth.

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,512
The opponent's trying, but now
it's Swift on the attack. Swift parries.

69
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:26,885
And he brings him close.
And that's a touch!

70
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,724
- 15! Swift wins!
- There you go! 15!

71
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,520
Lino Swift has set a new record!

72
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,064
So, you taught him
how to step his game up,

73
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,649
and now, no one can touch him?

74
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,734
I gave him some guidance,
but Lino's a phenom.

75
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,110
Just some?

76
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,154
- No touches?
- Uh-huh.

77
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,198
- There's no way.
- Come on.

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,742
- He must've cheated.
- He's obviously cheating.

79
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,495
Come on, this is ridiculous.

80
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,790
Something ain't right!

81
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,167
Check the machine! He cheated!

82
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,043
Something's up.

83
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:02,258
Nuh-uh. No. Let the haters
stay mad, Lino!

84
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,385
Hey, you did good.

85
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,890
New firewalls are up.

86
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,934
Status of the spyware update?

87
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,352
It's slowed.

88
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,729
Security protocols are at 81.9%.

89
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,403
Tom, I'd like to see you spend more time

90
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,405
helping the company thrive.

91
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:27,283
You'll be co-hosting
the entire summit with Claire.

92
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,118
Who? And co-hosting? I thought

93
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,995
I was just going to make an appearance.

94
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,455
This is the first summit
without your father.

95
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,375
Now, the time has come
for you to take the reins,

96
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,879
and it will require every minute
of your attention.

97
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,172
Tom,

98
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,067
you know the destruction
of Barton's ship put us

99
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,302
in financial crisis.

100
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:49,305
The summit is our best chance
to replenish what we've lost,

101
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,932
which is why Susannah Robb
will attend this year.

102
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,452
She's the 22-year-old
billionaire estate heiress?

103
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,939
She's basically you
with 18 inches of extensions.

104
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,316
Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:01,797
She's one of our biggest investors.

106
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:03,819
And she needs
to have the time of her life,

107
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,722
which brings us to the fact
that, apparently,

108
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,823
the Obamas bought all
of the Léo Beau champagne

109
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,199
- in North America.
- Oh!

110
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,719
I could try something cheaper, but...

111
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,371
No, no, no.

112
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,346
Stick with the cheap stuff.

113
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,373
Tom, I'm sending you something.

114
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,919
Ah.

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,004
This penlight design was

116
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:25,007
to be Barton's next
handcrafted invention,

117
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:27,217
and Tom, you're going to build it.

118
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,679
Barton said it could manipulate
UV light and make

119
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,932
cheap champagne taste like a top-shelf.

120
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,353
I'm happy to host solo if Tom can't...

121
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,188
No. You can be my helper,

122
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,150
but we're going to show
Wall Street and Susannah Robb

123
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,403
that Swift Enterprises
is still the HBIC.

124
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:51,033
Okay, I don't know what "BIHC" means,

125
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,743
but Lorraine, we are late for our 11:00.

126
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,371
All right.

127
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,085
Okay, I say you tell your mom

128
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,045
about Uncle Barton and The Road Back.

129
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:06,048
Look, if we get my mom involved,
she could end up dead.

130
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,550
Instead, we're going to invite
Eskol and Rowan to the summit,

131
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:10,386
and I'm going to clone Rowan's phone...

132
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:12,155
- so I can stop Barclay's spyware.
- Uh, oh, okay.

133
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,806
So, you're going

134
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,684
to build your father's
champagne-miracle penlight,

135
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,978
crush the summit, win over Susannah Robb

136
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,982
and stop Barclay's spyware
before the breach hits 100%?

137
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:26,110
That's a lot, even for you.

138
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,529
If I don't,
the company's money dries up,

139
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,240
I lose Barclay,
and my dad dies in space.

140
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,367
Baby, I'm Tom Swift. Let's go.

141
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,828
Such a drama queen.

142
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:41,351
Here's how we get Rowan to the summit

143
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,669
so I can hack his cell phone.

144
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,505
We'll send Eskol the jet
so he can arrive in style.

145
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,107
Yeah, he would never turn down a chance

146
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,467
to secure donors with deep pockets.

147
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,885
Well, he'll be able to schmooze

148
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,363
with an audience
whose pockets are so deep,

149
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:54,888
Adele will be rolling in them.

150
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,098
And, most importantly,

151
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,891
he'll bring Rowan to us,

152
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,352
since Rowan... he, um...

153
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,729
Rejected you.

154
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,480
The word is "rejected."

155
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,524
This cloning device

156
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,693
will mirror the data on Rowan's phone.

157
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:10,279
And with that data, we'll be
able to stop Barclay's spyware.

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,031
I created this in college,

159
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,967
just 'cause I wanted
to check on a few jump-offs.

160
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,993
Spy on. You mean spy on?

161
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,953
We used 'em for your boys, too.

162
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,667
The summit rolls out the
company's next big products.

163
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,379
The Augmented Reality Monocle
is our crown jewel.

164
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:30,049
Wow. Everyone will get one of these,

165
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,468
- including Rowan.
- Dope!

166
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,637
Now, I'll modify the programming
of the monocle to use

167
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,348
facial replacement software, and no one

168
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,934
will see me while
the festivities are underway.

169
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:44,766
Rowan tried to ghost me,
but now I'll be invisible.

170
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,981
Poof.

171
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:47,649
- Mm.
- And that's when

172
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,193
you'll clone Rowan's phone.

173
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:53,572
Uh, but how close do you have to be
for the cloning device to work?

174
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:55,949
A perfect nine inches for one minute.

175
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,578
So basically right on top
of the man who's conning you.

176
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,038
Solid plan.

177
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,916
Solid as that lineup.

178
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:08,045
Mm! Iconic. Timeless.

179
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,005
Lil Nas X has the same pair,

180
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,925
but his are probably scuffed.

181
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,944
All right, y'all, let's go get
pretty for this summit.

182
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,887
Let's go. Come on.

183
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,562
Team check. Everyone good?

184
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,108
Lino,
are my penlight instructions clear?

185
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,734
Super clear. Prepping it now.

186
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,112
I'll be out as soon as I'm done.

187
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,854
Isaac's a go.

188
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,965
Zenzi's here.

189
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,488
Nice job hiding the cloning device.

190
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:44,123
Almost there, Barclay.

191
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:48,710
We'll have you back
to normal soon. Hang on.

192
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,760
Justin Chase.

193
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,081
That suit is a vibe. Vintage Valentino?

194
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,784
No, it's just something I had in
my closet. Hmm. I'm glad you like it.

195
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,810
Did I say that I liked it...

196
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,354
or that I liked it on you?

197
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,481
- A key distinction.
- Uh-huh.

198
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:13,277
Look, I know every major player
in here, so if you want,

199
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:17,531
I'll be your curly haired
business encyclopedia.

200
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,825
Thank you. I accept.

201
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,244
And, um, my phone's been off,

202
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:24,746
so, sorry if you've been trying
to get ahold of me.

203
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:26,957
I haven't.

204
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,044
I'll just add Justin's response

205
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,130
to the re-rejection...
rejection algorithm.

206
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,425
Okay, did you have
to say "rejection" twice?

207
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,936
Susannah? Hi. Hello.

208
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,396
- Hi.
- Mm.

209
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:51,852
I'm glad the weather
was on your side today.

210
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,210
Well, any weather's good weather
for the Speciale, Lorraine.

211
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:56,528
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

212
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,042
It's Susannah Robb. Time to shine.

213
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,051
Lorraine, I have to say...
Money well spent.

214
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,494
Well, you know.

215
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,538
See you later.

216
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,935
Imagine losing your parents
in a plane crash at 16. Spit.

217
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,920
And tripling their company's
revenue in two years.

218
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,379
What a queen.

219
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:16,562
- That is impressive.
- Yes. Good luck.

220
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:19,885
Susannah! I love this Balmain on you.

221
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,137
- Olivier is a genius.
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,698
We're thinking of doing a line together.

223
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,849
Nice. How are you enjoying the summit?

224
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,726
Oh, it's great.

225
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,062
The only thing left are
those two product announcements

226
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,189
to get me two more V4's.

227
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,083
Well, I'll 3-D print you
a Louboutin heel protector

228
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:36,360
so you can speed-shift. Vroom, vroom?

229
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,033
And just wait until you see the consumer

230
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,364
products that we're rolling out tonight.

231
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:45,160
You know, I know what it takes
to carry on a family legacy.

232
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:48,205
I'm happy you're the one
to carry on Barton's.

233
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,124
Yes, and-and we know
all of our investors

234
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,584
share the same sentiment.

235
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:53,794
I'm sure.

236
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,087
Shall we?

237
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,130
Yes. Absolutely.

238
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:58,548
Tell me more about this space.

239
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,803
The plan worked.

240
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,763
Eskol and Rowan just walked in.

241
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,560
Hello!

242
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,272
Hello, and good evening, everyone.

243
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,732
So good to see
you. Thank you for being here.

244
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,192
Please, everyone, gather round.

245
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,872
Bring it on in! Come on. Bring it on in.

246
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:21,321
Eskol looks happy.

247
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,115
Let's keep him that way.

248
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:25,338
He has to stay here
until the final announcement.

249
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:28,354
Tom, Lino's ready with
the penlight when you're done.

250
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,833
Welcome to the Annual

251
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,293
Swift Enterprises Summit.

252
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,839
We are excited to give you a first look

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,843
at two game-changing,
consumer-facing products.

254
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,554
And the first... Are you ready?

255
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:47,306
Is SwiftLush Nanocream.

256
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:53,687
Yes. Move over, tinted moisturizer.

257
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,274
SwiftLush Nanocream
is a bioadaptive cream

258
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,943
that perfectly matches your skin tone

259
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,904
on contact. Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:05,574
It essentially becomes
a real-life beauty filter.

261
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,955
Now, I didn't moisturize
this morning, so,

262
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,171
hopefully, you notice a difference.

263
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,831
Hmm? Otherwise, we can just
demonstrate on Claire.

264
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,791
Come on,
Claire, let's show 'em a little bit.

265
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,209
Oh. Yeah, just a little. Yeah.

266
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:17,373
You just need a little.

267
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,589
Ah, it's good. Mm.

268
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,799
Everyone, SwiftLush Nanocream.

269
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,634
SwiftLush Nanocream,
ladies and gentlemen.

270
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,011
SwiftLush Nanocream.

271
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,139
Yeah.

272
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,391
Glad you can keep it light
while I do the heavy lifting.

273
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:38,482
It's set up for you to program
using voice dictation.

274
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,776
Incredible.

275
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,695
Your fine-motor skills are better
than the machines, little bro.

276
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:44,821
- Good lookin'.
- Yo.

277
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:55,415
Thank you so much for being here.

278
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,209
You're going to have
a private little tour

279
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,294
of some of Tom's finest inventions,

280
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,176
starting out with the
plyometric training shoe.

281
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,466
And here we have the
Swift brand smartwatch.

282
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,886
We've got one here, but this one
I really wanted to highlight.

283
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:10,222
Uh, Tom?

284
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:14,976
Thank you for attending
the Swift Enterprises Annual Summit.

285
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,564
Remarkable!

286
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,024
Eskol just got a phone call,

287
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,418
and then he sent Rowan to get his coat.

288
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,152
I think they're leaving.

289
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,740
Zenzi, stall Eskol while we find Rowan.

290
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,426
We can't clone Rowan's phone
and save Barclay

291
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,540
if they leave. Go.

292
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:39,584
Anything? Hey. Hey. How are you?

293
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:41,503
What's up, brother?

294
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:44,673
We have to find
Eskol and Rowan now. Hey!

295
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:47,134
Hey, boo.

296
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:50,262
Guys, the spyware is pushing
through. Hey. Hey.

297
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:54,474
Nothing up here. I'll keep looking.

298
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,814
Congressman? Congressman?

299
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,400
We're, uh, just about to start
the final presentation.

300
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,318
What's, uh, taking you from us?

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,404
Victoria, I'll be right there. Sure.

302
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,813
I would love to stay.

303
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,825
The campaign donations
have been quite generous.

304
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,120
But there's a patent crisis
with one of my former companies.

305
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,352
They need my help.

306
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,874
- A patent crisis?
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,735
Yeah, well, that's an average
Tuesday for me, so...

308
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:24,129
I just sent your assistant

309
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,755
my patent lawyer rolodex.

310
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,633
Now you can stay
until the end of the event.

311
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,303
You are remarkable.

312
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,472
Yeah, I know.

313
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:36,308
Maybe by the time this night is over,

314
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,477
you'll have an answer
to my dinner invitation?

315
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,322
Eskol is coming back inside.

316
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:57,871
You're welcome.

317
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,037
Oh, thank you, Zenzi.

318
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,980
You are getting a fat raise
when this is over.

319
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:04,688
Nice, Zenzi. Tom, I'm on my way.

320
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:09,321
Protocol's at 52%.

321
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,427
Hang on, buddy.

322
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:14,679
Right.

323
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,016
Oh, crap. I'm late.

324
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:19,893
Tom, Tom, listen.

325
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,353
I'd like for you to meet some

326
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,254
of our international supporters.
This is...

327
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,921
He's... Mm. Oh.

328
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,882
Thank you. Um...

329
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,425
T-Tom.

330
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,761
Lino, what's up? You good?

331
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,973
Of course you're late.

332
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:59,599
Y-Yeah, I-I'm good. Go do your thing.

333
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,768
Champagne's ready for conversion.

334
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,603
Ms. Robb, Claire Cormier,

335
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,063
interim CEO of Swift Enterprises.

336
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,398
Thank you, Claire.

337
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,608
Tom, you're killing it tonight.

338
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,111
Mm. SwiftLush Nanocream was amazing.

339
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:14,406
But what I'm most excited for
is your closing ceremony,

340
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:15,967
where you show me
you could lead Swift Enterprises

341
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,451
- to a fruitful future.
- Our future's lit.

342
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:20,453
I want the closing ceremony to have you

343
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,872
and every other investor making it rain

344
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,583
on Swift Enterprises.

345
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:26,751
I can't wait.

346
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,848
Justin's having a lot of fun.

347
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,620
Better go get him.

348
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:47,606
Before one of those strapping
young men steals him away.

349
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:54,154
Claire, I know
you're used to chasing things

350
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:57,657
that don't want you, but
we don't do that around here.

351
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:00,493
Nice shoelaces.

352
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,687
- You playing against LeBron later?
- Oh, yeah.

353
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,290
So don't break your neck when I dunk
on this next announcement.

354
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,129
Once the performance starts,

355
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:13,298
I'll be cloaking everyone
who has a monocle on.

356
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,300
Then, once you confirm that I'm cloaked,

357
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,344
I'll sneak up to Rowan,
and then, hopefully,

358
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,971
- he won't notice me.
- Hey, just breathe, breathe.

359
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,015
All right, the plan is going to work.

360
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:25,852
We are going to save Barclay, okay?

361
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,312
All right?

362
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:28,897
Get moving!

363
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:30,857
Claire's about to start
without you again.

364
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,692
Is this mine?

365
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:35,695
Barclay is on his deathbed.
Focus on the mission.

366
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,455
Honored guests,

367
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,459
a core value at Swift Enterprises is

368
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:54,339
that if you can dream it,
we can make it happen.

369
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:02,222
And with AR Monovision, we have.

370
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,560
That's for you.

371
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,314
I have high hopes for this presentation.

372
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,858
Well, keep this on.

373
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,736
Trust me.

374
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,114
You boys won't want to miss this.

375
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,199
I can't imagine
I'll be seeing anything better,

376
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,785
but, uh, I'll take your word for it.

377
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:31,527
Now, augmented reality goggles
are usually bulky and hideous,

378
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:36,047
but AR Monovision is an AR experience

379
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:39,114
that only uses one eye.

380
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,510
Oh, yes.

381
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:45,181
AR Monovision syncs
with your optic nerve

382
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,226
and alters what both eyes see, okay?

383
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,520
It's all safe. It's good.

384
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,398
Everybody, put your monocles on.

385
00:18:55,734 --> 00:19:00,255
And without further ado,
we proudly present to you

386
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,532
The Rise Up.

387
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,409
Ooh.

388
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,101
Look at this!

389
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,002
Okay.

390
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:59,047
I should be cloaked
from everyone's view. Zenzi?

391
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:02,175
Damn, Tom. You're a genius.

392
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,427
Uh, you're welcome, but,

393
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,596
can you see me on the stage?
Did it work?

394
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,154
It worked. You're invisible.

395
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:17,273
Perfect.

396
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:18,338
Now go clone that phone.

397
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,752
Tom, be careful. You're going to be

398
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:24,239
within a foot of Mr. Fatal
Attraction. Stay on mission.

399
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,550
Cloning initiated.

400
00:20:57,063 --> 00:21:00,400
I've never seen anything like that.

401
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,203
Cloning successful.

402
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,552
It's done.

403
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:29,304
Meet me in five minutes.

404
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:39,772
S-Security protocols are at 42%.

405
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:41,900
Okay. Okay.

406
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:43,735
I'm cracking Rowan's password now.

407
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:46,279
Uh, two, zero, seven, three.

408
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,907
Once I locate the spyware's
host program, I can...

409
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:54,037
- Oh, no. What?!
- What? You're not his wallpaper?

410
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:57,916
Oh, no. It's got a secondary
security measure.

411
00:21:57,957 --> 00:22:01,920
It needs Rowan's DNA
before we can unlock it.

412
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,963
That's NSA-level security.

413
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,938
For a congressman's bodyguard?

414
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:07,216
I told you.

415
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,594
Rowan's an enemy we know nothing about.

416
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:13,306
We need to regroup and think,

417
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,767
or a small nick with a tactical
blade could procure some DNA.

418
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,894
- Um... no stabbing.
- This is a party.

419
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,687
Okay? And I am thinking.

420
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,941
We just, uh... We're just
having a minor setback, okay?

421
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:25,276
We need to get a strand
of hair, some sweat.

422
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:26,653
Maybe some other bodily fluids

423
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:28,488
you wouldn't mind getting from him.

424
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,409
Really? Both of y'all coming
for me on this day?

425
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,634
Crap, crap. We're late to prep

426
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:33,093
the champagne for the closing toast.

427
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:35,286
- Okay. Oh, go.
- Just. Okay, okay, okay.

428
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,666
Security protocols are at 33%.

429
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,501
33? How much time is that?

430
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,419
Okay, we have an hour left, maybe two.

431
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,338
Hang tight, Barclay.

432
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,508
We just have to get through the
toast and the closing remarks.

433
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,678
Oh, there you are. Did you
finish Barton's penlight design?

434
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,638
Of course I did. You know I did.

435
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:58,434
Oh, the penlight! You were so busy

436
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,204
earlier, you didn't notice
that you dropped it.

437
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,480
I picked it up and kept it safe for you.

438
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,649
Oh. Okay.

439
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,070
Okay.

440
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,585
Yeah. I altered Dad's design

441
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:27,519
so that it could be multiplied
without diluting its power.

442
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,508
To my mentor, Barton.

443
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,194
And to my love. Hmm.

444
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:35,722
Mmm.

445
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:37,181
Oh! Oh!

446
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:38,558
It's bad.

447
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,351
Oh.

448
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:43,104
You have to fix this now. Oh, oh.

449
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:47,233
What? What? What happened?

450
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:50,737
Zenzi, one second.

451
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,822
Someone sabotaged my code.

452
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,842
The pH balance of the champagne
has been multiplied

453
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,826
by a degree of negative one!

454
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,870
Susannah's asking for you,
and so is everyone else.

455
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,830
Oh.

456
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,307
Please don't tell me that we ran
out of champagne flutes,

457
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,976
and we have
to use drinking glasses instead.

458
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,419
No, it's not that bad.
Tom was only about to

459
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:08,254
make our investors vomit the champagne.

460
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,089
Right. Um...

461
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,967
ginger ale, baking soda.

462
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,343
No. No, no, no.

463
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:17,263
An antacid wouldn't work, but...

464
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,932
something acidic would.

465
00:24:19,974 --> 00:24:21,559
I can configure the penlight

466
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,478
to use the citric acid in an orange zest

467
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,813
to fix the pH balance of the champagne.

468
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,106
Okay?

469
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:28,775
Multiple it by a degree of 1.68.

470
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,551
- Success.
- Okay.

471
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,470
We make a good team, Mr. Chase.

472
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,888
Yeah, well.

473
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,973
Let's celebrate later,

474
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,101
just the two of us.

475
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,608
- Listen...
- Uh-huh, so,

476
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,318
scan all of this zest and then

477
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,160
have the servers garnish
every glass out there

478
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,364
before anyone drinks it.

479
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,117
I'm going to go have a word
with the interloper.

480
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:22,161
Zenzi, have those done
before I start my speech.

481
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,663
Bye.

482
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:26,457
Zenzi, you're the greatest.

483
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,042
We also make a fantastic team.

484
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,044
Stop, Tom.

485
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:34,715
Good evening.

486
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,509
Thank you all for coming tonight.

487
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,511
To all of our partners and investors

488
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,847
and future investors.

489
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,807
As you all know, this is our...

490
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,601
Claire.

491
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:50,606
I would say you still look sick,
but that's just your face.

492
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:53,651
Sick with guilt because
you sabotaged my penlight.

493
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,154
Are you insane?

494
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:58,197
I know what that penlight
means to Lorraine.

495
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,740
Mm, sure.

496
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:02,451
You see these edges, honey?

497
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:05,454
They're secured.

498
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,055
So, you're going to have to pull
a lot harder to scalp me.

499
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,128
You see what the servers are doing?

500
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,173
They're administering my antidote.

501
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,175
I'm just relieved it all
worked out for the best.

502
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,302
For the sake of the company.

503
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:22,054
Oh, is that dandruff?

504
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:24,557
F-Firewalls
failing. Spyware accelerated.

505
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,559
Se-Security protocols at five percent.

506
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,312
For the sake of the company,

507
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,731
you take it from here.

508
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,608
Tom, what are you doing?

509
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,610
The spyware is accelerating,
and I can't stop it.

510
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:37,528
I won't lose Barclay.

511
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,506
I know what I have to do,
and I have to do it alone.

512
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,615
Tom, no!

513
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:41,782
Don't be stupid.

514
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,327
Send voice note. Rowan, meet me

515
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,579
at Swift Manor observatory,
or I'll confront Eskol

516
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,890
about everything you've done. Now.

517
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:56,297
P-Protocol's 2.9%.

518
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,965
Why are you surveilling me?

519
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,776
You tell me I deserve to know
what happened to my dad,

520
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,219
and then you ghost me?

521
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,429
It doesn't make sense.

522
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:05,014
You are one dumb genius.

523
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,266
The Road Back is no joke.

524
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:10,269
They take out anyone who's in
their way, including their own.

525
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,896
You're going to get me killed.

526
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:13,564
How am I in their way? Huh?

527
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:16,776
What are they after? Tell me.

528
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:19,862
Do not put your hands on me.

529
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,367
Tell me.

530
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,287
You're a coward.

531
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:30,331
Admit you feel something between us.

532
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:32,708
I'm telling you right now
to leave me alone.

533
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:03,197
Fine. I will leave you alone.

534
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:07,660
But only if you tell me
right here, right now,

535
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:10,413
can I trust you?

536
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,707
No.

537
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,335
Tom!

538
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:18,129
Thought you said I couldn't trust you.

539
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,047
Protocol's 2.4%.

540
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:23,217
This is your last warning.

541
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,928
I saved your life again.

542
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,307
Don't make me take it next.

543
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,441
What?

544
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:42,486
You thought my biceps were just
for thirst traps?

545
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:47,033
You're on the wrong side.

546
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:51,954
The Road Back hates technology?
All right, bet.

547
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,291
I'm gonna make it so they can't
even brush their teeth

548
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,460
without seeing a Swift
Enterprises pop-up telling them

549
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,086
that their breath stinks.

550
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:01,130
If you think this is
about a better smartphone,

551
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,673
you're mistaken.

552
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,885
The Road Back wants
to turn back the clock to a time

553
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:08,387
when people like themselves
were fully in charge.

554
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,975
Pissing them off with a new gadget
might win a battle,

555
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,103
but you need to focus
on winning the war.

556
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:18,105
Otherwise,

557
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,734
everyone you love will end up dead.

558
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,596
Bioadaptive cream

559
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,349
that perfectly matches your skin tone.

560
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,731
Tom, 0.5%.

561
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,018
The breach is almost
through my firewall.

562
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:15,579
Okay. I'm using his DNA
to unlock his phone.

563
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:20,126
I'm in. Okay, I'm locating
the spyware host now.

564
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,253
0.1%.

565
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,550
Zero...

566
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,262
Barclay?

567
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,639
Barclay!

568
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:35,516
How are you?

569
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,437
I am exceptional.

570
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:42,523
Oh.

571
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,652
Welcome home, buddy.

572
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:48,988
I missed you.

573
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:52,450
So, we're in the clear?

574
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,826
Better than that.

575
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:55,411
I removed the spyware,

576
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,455
but left the surveillance
software monitoring us.

577
00:30:57,496 --> 00:30:59,123
I created a partition that will allow us

578
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,600
to feed the enemy whatever info we want.

579
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,836
So, no matter who Eskol's working with,

580
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,254
we'll control what they learn.

581
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,417
Reclaiming the tactical advantage.

582
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:09,195
I appreciate that,

583
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,302
but let's have a refresher chat
about risk mitigation

584
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,471
moving forward.

585
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:16,432
Understood.

586
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,892
Good night,

587
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,060
Isaac.

588
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,034
What's wrong?

589
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:39,663
Today, during fencing tryouts,

590
00:31:39,705 --> 00:31:41,332
I knew what my opponent

591
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:44,877
was gonna do before he did it.

592
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,545
It's called good instincts.

593
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:48,327
That's the stuff we
were practicing, right?

594
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:52,384
No. It... It's like I was hallucinating.

595
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,637
Almost like I could see

596
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:58,407
electricity moving the nerves
in his muscles.

597
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:01,477
When did this start happening?

598
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,729
Couple weeks ago.

599
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,398
It's off and on.

600
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,401
I heard Aunt Lorraine
talk about it once.

601
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,570
My mom went through

602
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,532
something like this when I was three.

603
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:17,201
Right before she left me.

604
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:19,662
She went crazy.
What if that's happening to me?

605
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,247
Listen to me.

606
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:22,873
You are not her.

607
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,542
Whatever's going on with you,

608
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,961
we'll figure it out,
and we'll deal with it.

609
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:29,171
I just want to talk to my mom.

610
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:32,967
Maybe she'd have some answers.

611
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:43,060
Susannah. Thank you for coming.

612
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:45,771
Thank you for having me.

613
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,817
Yo! Susannah. How did you like
the closing ceremony?

614
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,760
Well, Claire really wowed
everyone with Swift Enterprises'

615
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:53,744
- plans for the future.
- Okay.

616
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,947
Investors were impressed.

617
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,782
Nice. So what are we talking?

618
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,784
Another 100 mil, easy?

619
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,244
- Mm.
- Mm.

620
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:02,079
150.

621
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,581
Tom...

622
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:06,000
I want to say it's not personal, but,

623
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,210
actually, it kind of is.

624
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,171
Swift Enterprises isn't getting
another dime out of me.

625
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,798
You see,

626
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,259
my family's faith was with Barton.

627
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,094
Mine's supposed to be with you.

628
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:20,347
Not Claire Cormier. I...

629
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:23,392
I don't follow her on Instagram.
I follow you.

630
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,394
You are the genius inventor.

631
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,646
You have the Swift last name,

632
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:29,481
so when you literally walk away

633
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:31,358
from an opportunity
to connect to the company,

634
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,862
you show me you can't do
what I did with mine.

635
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:36,363
Wait a minute. It's not like that.

636
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:39,033
I just... I had to go handle... Well...

637
00:33:39,074 --> 00:33:42,286
fewer words, more actions, yeah?

638
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,124
Love the shoes, though.

639
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,807
What on earth were you thinking?

640
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,493
The lack of Susannah's faith

641
00:34:06,518 --> 00:34:07,932
in the company will cause
a domino effect.

642
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:09,122
I will find a way to win her back.

643
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,189
Your way was tonight.

644
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,774
Just trust me. I...

645
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,943
How am I supposed to trust you
after all of this?

646
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:17,946
You know, half of these people
traveled around the world

647
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:21,575
to have a personal audience with you.

648
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:24,700
What was so important that you could

649
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:27,539
not complete your obligations, Tom?

650
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:29,875
All I needed was

651
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,921
15 minutes more of you
acting like an adult.

652
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,258
I thought there would be less
pressure on you now...

653
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,761
Less... pressure?

654
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,766
Without your father here.

655
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:50,187
- I know he was hard on you, but...
- Oh.

656
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:52,272
That's a nice way of putting it.

657
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:55,359
What are you really trying to say?

658
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:57,820
You think I don't know
you're relieved that he's gone?

659
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,345
Relieved?

660
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,330
Relieved?

661
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,660
I'm not relieved. You don't understand.

662
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,786
Then make...

663
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,332
Make me understand it.

664
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,459
I'm not relieved, because he's not...

665
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,131
He's not what?

666
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:22,699
Otherwise, everyone
you love will end up dead.

667
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:25,464
Your father is not what?

668
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:30,852
He's not the reason I left early.

669
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:34,481
It's just...

670
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,900
ever since he died,

671
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,154
I haven't felt like myself.

672
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:44,700
I built his ship.

673
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,663
And then, I watched it explode.

674
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:57,546
It is the last thing I see
when I close my eyes.

675
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,382
And it is the first thing
I see when I wake up.

676
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,718
Okay. Okay.

677
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,386
Baby, it's okay. It's okay.

678
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,388
I know. I know. I know. I know.

679
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,515
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

680
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,707
Excuse me. Mrs. Swift?

681
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,501
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

682
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:39,129
- It's Lino.
- Is he all right?

683
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:42,549
He's upset, and he was asking
about his mother.

684
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,719
No, we don't talk about my sister.

685
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,906
Hello?

686
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:08,742
Hi. I need you to find someone.

687
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,795
Time magazine sent over highlights

688
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,613
for their article on the summit.

689
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,098
They are calling it
the "Tech Event of the Year."

690
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,718
You should be proud.

691
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,015
Hey.

692
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:38,734
You know I'm your friend
before an employee.

693
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:40,858
What's wrong?

694
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:46,280
Tom just told me his grief
is clouding his judgment.

695
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,199
I'm-I'm losing faith

696
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,160
he can lead the company
in his current state.

697
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,706
We'll find a way forward.

698
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:59,167
After you get some rest.

699
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:02,713
Did you like the sleep gel
from the other night?

700
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:04,636
Oh, yes, I did.

701
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:07,497
I slept like a baby.

702
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:10,012
Here. I... I always have it on me.

703
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,806
It helps me with... with headaches.

704
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:27,029
Mmm.

705
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:32,484
I'm glad you told me
about Tom's... mental distress.

706
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,662
It's so important

707
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:38,665
that he doesn't struggle alone.

708
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:45,172
Hold out your finger.

709
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:55,842
Since Tom is so emotionally unstable,

710
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:59,645
the best way we can help him
is by providing supervision.

711
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,731
Sign these,

712
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,400
and I'll have discretionary approval

713
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:08,695
over all of his
Swift Enterprises requests.

714
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,490
I promise you,

715
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,784
I'll look after Tom.

716
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,537
I'll make sure he's safe.

717
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:27,255
Not bad for a 12.4 chance
of success, huh?

718
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:29,007
Always bet on Black.

719
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:33,720
Mm. Okay, Barclay.

720
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,514
Good to have you back.

721
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:43,271
Damn.

722
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,120
You promised me a celebration.

723
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,624
No glasses?

724
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:07,212
Who needs glasses when we have mouths?

725
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,761
Oh.

726
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,389
Ah, damn.

727
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:20,726
Oops.

728
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,770
Oops.

729
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,313
Come here, tech daddy.

730
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,517
It's bug-free. We can speak.

731
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,562
We didn't get the data from his AI,

732
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:07,314
but...

733
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,903
I found another way in.
