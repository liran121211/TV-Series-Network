- Yes, I did.

177
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,524
And why are you laughing?

178
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:03,825
- You did not kill him.

179
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,194
- Yo, it's not funny.
Yes, I did.

180
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:10,098
- Okay, okay, okay.

181
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,667
- You think I'm kidding.

182
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,737
- How?

183
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:17,839
- We were boxing.

184
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,374
- Jeremy.

185
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,709
- It wasn't my idea.

186
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:25,347
- You were boxing him?

187
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,515
- He stepped to me,
I had to defend myself.

188
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:30,385
- The man is 87 years old.

189
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:34,022
- I don't care,
I knocked his ass out.

190
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,490
- Jeremy!

191
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,561
- No, he started hooking
me and hitting me.

192
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,597
- And you hit him back.

193
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:43,697
- Yes.

194
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:49,804
- Yes. And he has brittle bones.

195
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:55,043
- And when he hit the
floor I heard all of 'em.

196
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,378
Crunch.

197
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,216
- Crunch?

198
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:02,517
- Yes, crunch.

199
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,686
- But wh... what... what
do you mean crunch?

200
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,058
- Crunch, like the Captain.

201
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,695
Or like them three little
elves: Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

202
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,432
- Where is he?

203
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:21,136
- In hell.

204
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,372
- Where is his body?

205
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:25,840
- In his room.

206
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,844
- Did you check on him?

207
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:30,945
- I couldn't.

208
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:32,714
- Why not, baby?

209
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,182
- 'Cause he flew over the couch.

210
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,353
- What the hell?

211
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,189
You hit that old man that hard?

212
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,857
- He hit me that hard.

213
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,794
You know your man ain't no punk.

214
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:50,966
- That is your grandpa, Jeremy.

215
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,202
- [sighs] He dead, I know.

216
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,371
- Baby, I'm sure he's fine.

217
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,173
- No, you didn't
hear them bones.

218
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,110
- When he hit the
floor, it was like,

219
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,848
they were like in a...
in a sack just rattling.

220
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,795
I believe his jogging
suit was the only thing

221
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,020
holding him together.

222
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,956
- I'll go check on him.

223
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,976
- No, baby, no, baby!
We need to get out of here.

224
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,093
Come on, let's go.

225
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,804
- We are going to check
on your grandfather.

226
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,463
- [stuttering]
Look, we'll tell everybody

227
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:25,267
he died on his own,
natural causes.

228
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,003
- What if he's hurt?

229
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,839
- He'll die eventually.

230
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,440
- That's cold.

231
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,018
You know when old people
die they can't get up,

232
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,845
they be laying on the
floor for hours in pain,

233
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:39,047
trying to call the alert thing.

234
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:41,428
- He got one of them bracelets.
Come on, let's run for it.

235
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:46,121
- How is he gonna
press it with his hook?

236
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,122
- He can use his tongue.

237
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:49,357
My grandmother said
he was a savage.

238
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:50,792
- Oh, my God.

239
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:53,094
No, no, no, no,
no, no, okay, no,

240
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,314
we're going to check on him.

241
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,773
We cannot leave your
grandfather here.

242
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:56,831
Come on!

243
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:00,335
- Baby, baby, baby,
this is elderly abuse.

244
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,435
- I know.

245
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:02,337
- I can go to jail.

246
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:04,706
- I know.

247
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,074
- So let's go, come on.

248
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,343
- No!

249
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,312
I'm not doing this with you.

250
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,980
And it ain't no gas in the car.

251
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,553
- Come on baby,
let's go check on him.

252
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,121
- He's dead, he's dead,
I know it.

253
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,890
- He gonna be alive.

254
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,658
Come on, come on, you can do it.

255
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:24,859
- I don't wanna go, baby.

256
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,194
- Come on.

257
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,986
- Wait, do you have reception?

258
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,888
- No, I'm playing a game.

259
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,425
- Wow.

260
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:50,760
- What?

261
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,962
- You should check
out the fridge.

262
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,164
- What is it?

263
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,499
- Nothing but prune juice
and things like that.

264
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,599
- Applesauce?

265
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,868
- SANDRA: Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,338
- Old people food.

267
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,240
- I mean, this is crazy.

268
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
- It is.

269
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,010
- What are we doing here?

270
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,646
- We are children
of the wrong parents.

271
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,584
- Wait.
- What?

272
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,886
- Why was mom talking
about drapes and paint.

273
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,186
- I don't know, she always
talks about drapes and paint.

274
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,128
And Dad.

275
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,398
He always gets on her nerves.

276
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,800
I don't know she's
telling us that.

277
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,537
- Do you think that they're
thinking of staying here?

278
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,738
There's no way.

279
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,199
- No, no, no, you
don't understand!

280
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,417
- Sandra, calm down.
- No, no.

281
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:41,344
What am I gonna do
without civilization?!

282
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:46,616
- You are so, so dramatic.

283
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:47,984
- We can't let them do this.

284
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:49,486
- Do what?

285
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,822
[panting]
I think... I think... I think...

286
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,991
[stuttering]

287
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,860
I think they're
thinking of moving here.

288
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,432
- Okay, they would never.

289
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,468
- No, no, look,
Dad lost his job.

290
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:06,736
- And?

291
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,380
- That is the whole
reason why we're here.

292
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,440
- Here we go.

293
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,275
- No, no, we have to stop them.

294
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,745
- No one said that.

295
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,580
- They're gonna move us
out of school

296
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,382
and we'll have to
go to school here

297
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,651
with the... the... the... the locals.

298
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,389
- Will you stop it?

299
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,391
- And we'll have
to hang out here.

300
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,126
And have local friends.

301
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:35,532
- This is just not happening.

302
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,143
- And no more time
with you and Rhonda.

303
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,001
- Wait, what?

304
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,469
- Mm-hmm, that's what I thought.

305
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,805
Okay, this cannot happen!

306
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,265
[stutters]
We have to do something.

307
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,607
- I know.

308
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,544
- Um, but are we sure they're
thinking about this?

309
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:48,645
- I know Mom.

310
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,347
- Yeah, and I know Dad.

311
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,016
- So?

312
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,453
- Oh. [crying]

313
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:00,156
You might be right.

314
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,225
- Then we have to do
all we can to make sure

315
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,227
this doesn't happen.

316
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,796
- I'm in.
- Okay.

317
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,097
So, what's the plan?

318
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,411
- You're telling me you
came up with all this

319
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,871
and you don't have a plan?

320
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,774
- Look, all I know is that
I'm not staying in a city

321
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:20,610
without reception.

322
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,980
I mean, who would do
that, Harriet Tubman?

323
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,524
- I'm pretty sure
there wasn't Internet

324
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,917
during that time.

325
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,086
- Whatever, I'm not doing it.

326
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,756
- Okay, okay,
let's just calm down.

327
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,496
- How can we look at this?

328
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:42,665
- Let's just stay
calm until we know

329
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,034
what they're thinking.

330
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,503
- Okay.

331
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,171
But we never know
what they're thinking!

332
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,509
- They think old.

333
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:53,977
We can't think that old.

334
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,345
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

335
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:59,048
- I mean, they were born
with rotary dial phones,

336
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,350
whatever that is.

337
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:05,655
- Ro... ro... rotary?
- That's what I said.

338
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,090
- Okay.

339
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,594
- You know what we'll do?

340
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,929
We'll run away.

341
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,767
- In what?

342
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,435
- In the car.

343
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:20,537
You can drive.

344
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:23,439
- You used up all
the gas, remember?

345
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,209
- Oh, dilemma.

346
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,444
- Yeah.

347
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,447
- I can't think of everything.

348
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,182
Do something!

349
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:35,452
- Uh... uh...

350
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:40,523
There was a horse. Walking.

351
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,325
- Do I look like
Stagecoach Annie?

352
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:46,496
- Yes.

353
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:47,997
- Really? Was she cute?

354
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,369
So you compare
