180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
- I mean, you know how kids are.

181
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:47,017
We're just...

182
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,019
- Just what?

183
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,320
- Silly.

184
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,625
- Okay, silly.

185
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,959
[laughing]

186
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,937
You know what, but I
really think that we should

187
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,962
look at this place.

188
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,397
Take a look around.

189
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:01,365
You don't like it?

190
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,542
- Hey, y'all seen my Grandpa?

191
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,734
- You can't find him, baby?

192
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:04,568
- Nah.

193
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:05,748
- Okay, let's leave a note.

194
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:09,173
- Where was his room?

195
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,441
- Somewhere back there.

196
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,743
Just follow the sound
of the loud farts.

197
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,979
- I'mma check this side.

198
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:16,680
- LEAH: Okay, baby.

199
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,514
- Hey, baby.

200
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,482
- Hmm?

201
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,217
- This place is huge.

202
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,385
- Is it?

203
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,220
- Yes, yes, a lot of rooms.

204
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,022
- Well that's good.

205
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,991
- Guess what, guess what?
We can make a lot of money.

206
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,794
- Okay. Okay.

207
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:37,234
- Well, that's good for Grandpa.

208
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:39,670
- Yeah, it is. [chuckling]

209
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,572
- And good for us when we leave.

210
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:45,008
- Well...

211
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,944
- What?

212
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,846
- Uh, what y'all think
about staying here

213
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,013
just a little bit longer?

214
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:55,686
- Mom.

215
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,786
- Yes?

216
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,257
- Are you trying to kill me?

217
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,158
- LEAH: [stuttering]

218
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:03,127
- No, no, yes, you are.

219
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:04,495
- Only sometimes.

220
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,797
- Mom.

221
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:14,004
Stay here for how long?

222
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,506
- Never mind.

223
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,979
- Good, because if I had to
stay here, I would just die.

224
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:26,583
- Good thing there's a
graveyard across the street.

225
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,890
- LEAH: Baby?

226
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,094
- She cannot be serious!

227
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,929
- I think she is.

228
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,598
She had that serious
look on her face.

229
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:43,910
- No, that was the cramps look.
Tell me it's her cramps look!

230
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,503
- I don't, I don't think
it was her cramps look.

231
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,038
The cramps look look like this.

232
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
She did more like...

233
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:54,811
Not...

234
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,816
- You might be right,
you might be right.

235
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,155
- ♪

236
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,490
- Nasty.

237
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,659
[laughing]

238
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,960
Nastier.

239
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,631
Ooh, that's real
damn nasty there.

240
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,801
Ooh, it's nastier this way!

241
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,670
[chuckling]

242
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,973
Ah, n... Ooh, scratch and sniff,
look at that.

243
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,542
- [knocking]

244
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,211
- Who the hell is it?

245
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:30,446
- JEREMY: It's me, Grandpa.

246
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,847
- Nobody home.

247
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,393
- JEREMY: Can you
open the door, please?

248
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,952
- Come on in.

249
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,655
- Hey.

250
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,459
- And who the hell are you?

251
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,942
- What are you talking about?
I'm your grandson.

252
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,167
- Well, what the hell
are yo doing here?

253
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:53,836
- Grandpa, we been here.

254
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,705
Don't you remember?
I saw you earlier.

255
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,074
- Oh, man, I thought
that was three days ago.

256
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,746
- I have got to stop
smoking my own shit.

257
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,618
- Grandpa, I got a
huge question for you.

258
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:09,919
- What's that?

259
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,420
- You left handed
or right handed?

260
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,922
- [bleep] how many
hands do you see?

261
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,492
- How do you roll a joint?

262
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,160
- Very slowly.

263
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,466
Now what in the
hell do you want?

264
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,401
- What do you mean?

265
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,003
- Just what I said.

266
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,438
- You don't remember
us coming to see you?

267
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:30,973
- Boy, let me tell
you something.

268
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:35,144
My mind is as tight as them
damn jeans you have on.

269
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:39,015
- They ain't that tight.

270
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:39,982
- Yes they are.

271
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,584
- They're called
skinny jeans, Pop.

272
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,853
Well they should be called
blood pressure jeans

273
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,922
'cause I can see
what the hell you working with.

274
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:51,994
Or bitch-ass jeans
'cause I see a camel toe.

275
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,774
- Them, them my [bleep], man.

276
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,999
- You got two?

277
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,603
- Grandpa.

278
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,039
- I only got one.

279
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,007
I was wiping too hard one day.

280
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:10,722
Boy, I'll tell you about it,
I'm just guessing,

281
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:14,150
but your wife got to
be very unsatisfied.

282
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:20,223
Yeah, you better watch it
'cause that'll make 'em cheat.

283
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:24,736
I ain't never had
a woman cheat on me and Tyrone.

284
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,028
- Who is Tyrone?

285
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,930
- Mm, you don't need to see him.

286
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,432
Stand back, I'll show you.

287
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:32,869
- Will you stop it?

288
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,303
- That's what she said.

289
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,840
- You cannot be kin to me.

290
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,075
- Well, I am.

291
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,245
- Well, it's been
established on the top half.

292
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:44,447
But I don't know about
that bottom half.

293
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,320
- I am part mule.

294
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,922
[neighing]

295
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:56,535
- Look, man, I have something
I wanna talk to you about.

296
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,160
Will you stop?

297
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,730
- Oh, excuse me, you come in
here for some serious shit.

298
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,167
Now, why don't you go on home?

299
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,104
Go out that door
and hook a left.

300
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,439
- I wanna talk to
you about this place.

301
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,908
- What about it?

302
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,844
- I mean, do you think
you can make some money?

303
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:19,415
- You mean, opening
back up as a facility?

304
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:20,550
Hell no!

305
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:25,988
I was gonna turn
it into a whore house.

306
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,024
But I was gonna only
work with old hoes.

307
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,428
Bring all them hoes
out of retirement.

308
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,132
Sometimes when a hoe
reach a certain age,

309
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,934
don't nobody wanna
mess with them no more.

310
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,070
So that's why I'mma
call it "The Old Hoe House."

311
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:44,774
Nah, I'm just BS-ing you boy.

312
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,642
Me and your grandma was happy.

313
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:50,513
Boy, before it got all, you
know, disorganized it was,

314
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,847
the place was beautiful.

315
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:52,982
- Okay.

316
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:56,652
- Oh man, the staff was amazing.

317
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,454
- Ah, good, I like that.

318
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:02,491
- The place was much cleaner
and everything was great.

319
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,702
- Good, good, good.

320
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:06,262
- We had a little STD
problem round here but...

321
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,000
- Everybody didn't get it.

322
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,103
- What about you?

323
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,906
- Nah, I took some
shots in the ass

324
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,717
and that cleared it up.

325
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:19,976
- Alright.

326
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,244
- Don't tell your grandma.

327
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:27,149
- She's dead, Pop.
Is that how she died?

328
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,120
- No, she died 'cause the dude
who stole her all the time

329
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,421
stole her medicine.

330
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,925
- But it used to be
really great in here

331
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,260
before all that happened.

332
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,228
- Okay, that's good to
hear, that's good to hear.

333
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:40,763
- But you know what
we really loved

334
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,898
back in the day?

335
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,065
- JEREMY: What's that?

336
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,201
- Boy, I'mma tell you
what we really loved.

337
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:50,873
Ooh, doing the sexy, nasty,
boy, your grandmama. [chuckles]

338
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,241
- Hey, hey.

339
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,052
- No, I'm telling you boy,
your grandmama, before...

340
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,444
- Hey, man!

341
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,489
- Her legs was loose,
ain't nothing like old [bleep]

342
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,648
with brand new hips.

343
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,983
- Come on, Pop.
I'm not trying to hear that.

344
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,718
- No, boy, let me tell you, man.

345
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,554
- Nah man, don't tell me.

346
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,590
- Wobbly. [muttering]

347
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,958
- Stop it, man.

348
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,527
- But you can't spank that ass,
especially with the hook.

349
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:16,065
But she really loved you.

350
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,266
- Well, thank you.

351
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,477
- I remember when y'all
would get together,

352
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,141
she would kiss you
every time she saw you.

353
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,737
- Right on the lips.

354
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,439
- Yeah, but...

355
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:24,716
- But what?

356
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,741

357
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:29,178
If you knew where
them lips had been.

358
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,246
- Come on, man.

359
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,215
- Oh, my God.
They was all over me.

360
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,492
- Hey, don't nobody
wanna hear that.

361
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,317
- Man, them lips!

362
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,151
- Would you stop it?

363
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,286
- And them false hips!

364
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,298
- I'm gonna walk right out
of here if you don't stop it.

365
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:43,659
- Okay, see the problem is
you don't get it, do you?

366
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,994
- What?

367
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,064
- That's what
I'm trying to get you to do.

368
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:50,933
- Look, come on. Pop.
Man, I love you.

369
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,636
- Take your lying
ass back to Chicago

370
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:56,639
and them bastards...
Not your wife, I like her.

371
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,908
She cool.

372
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,142
She good people.

373
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,544
She got a nice ass.

374
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,350
Can't help me from looking.
- You ain't lying.

375
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,127
But look, man, that's what
I'm trying to talk to you about.

376
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,697
- Boy, you just left us here.

377
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,698
- No, I didn't.

378
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,058
- Yes, you did!
- I was working.

379
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:17,402
- Yeah, well, you know,
you went up there

380
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,327
and you lost your job.

381
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,263
- Yeah, but that
wasn't my fault.

382
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,732
- Why is the [bleep] in
the unemployment office

383
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:25,868
always trying to
blame everybody else?

384
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,570
It's always the man.

385
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:29,939
- Okay, look,
what are you doing?

386
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,874
- [bleep]!

387
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,309
How many times I gotta say it?

388
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,721
I'm trying to get you to leave.

389
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,549
Follow instructions:
go out the door, hook a left.

390
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,653
- Grandpa, I love you, man.

391
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,521
- Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit.

392
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,625
- I love you and I love Grandma.

393
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,127
- No, you don't.

394
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,738
- Yes, I do.

395
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,896
- You know what?

396
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,641
You can keep your little
"I love you, I love you,

397
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:56,866
I love Grandma."

398
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,870
But you know what?
Your inheritance has been spent.

399
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,004
- Yeah, I know that.

400
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,240
- You know what?
And look around, this it.

401
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,908
- I have been.

402
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,043
- Been what?

403
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,010
- Looking around.

404
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,278
- And?

405
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,014
- This place,
[bleep] is in bad shape.

406
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,695
- Don't worry about it,
I'll fix it up.

407
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,720
- How?

408
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,522
- I got some favors
I can call in.

409
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,792
You know, Earl, he got,
he missing one hand too, so...

410
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,261
And then Johnny, he got diabetes

411
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,705
but he can work a half a day.

412
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:30,566
And, and his wife,
she can lift stuff.

413
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,101
So we got it covered.

414
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,369
- I remember her.

415
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,038
- Yeah, she's real good
for hanging wallpaper.

416
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,076
- Grandpa, to finish this
place, 80-year-old men

417
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,144
couldn't do it.

418
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:43,922
- It's gonna be a bunch
of 80-year-old men in here,

419
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,581
don't worry about it.
It won't be one.

420
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,650
- Well, I am.

421
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,118

422
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,387

424
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,124
- Are you trying to get up?

425
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,359
- Uh, duh!

426
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,799
- Wait a minute,
am I missing something?

427
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,769
- Well, you did spend
my inheritance on it.

428
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,804
- Yes I did, and what
you gonna do about it?

429
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,506
- Hey, hold up.
- Whoa.

430
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,741
- Calm down, calm down.

431
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:15,044
- Whoa, boy, don't walk
up on me like that.

432
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,080
Don't let the hook fool you
'cause I'll whoop your ass.

433
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,316
- Hey, Grandpa, stop
before you hurt yourself.

434
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,351
- No, no, I'm not
gonna hurt myself.

435
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,553
I'm gonna hurt you.

436
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,588
- Grandpa, will you sit down?

437
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,423
- No, I'm gonna be standing up

438
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,825
over your knocked-out-ass body!

439
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,994
- Why are you
getting so hostile?

440
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,505
- [bleep], you making me
[bleep] hostile,

441
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,797
and this medication too!

442

- You think so?

447
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,445

my hand I was a boxer?

- Yeah, when you was in th Navy.

449

a one hand division,

but I could have done it.

451
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:57,353
