1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,337
- Ooh, baby, what is this place?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,240
- This look like some
bull... up in here.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,644
- Ah, there's... everywhere.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,347
- Is that a rat?
- Wha?

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,183
- Oh, oh! My chin, baby.

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,151
- I'm sorry.
- Damn.

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,287
- Where are we?

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,788
- Is this how y'all treat
Grandpa?

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,528
- Okay, this is your
grandfather's nice home.

10
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:31,365
- Mm-hmm, now we know what
to do when you guys get old.

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,100
- I'll...
- SANDRA: Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,569
- We gonna drop
y'all right here.

13
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,604
- Boy, I wish you would
try to drop me somewhere.

14
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,707
- Calm down, Dad,
don't be so hostile.

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,242
- I got scared for a second.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,281
- I mean, Mom, Dad, how much
are y'all paying for this place?

17
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,051
- Are we paying for this place?

18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,556
Well, let's not focus on that,

19
00:00:55,656 --> 00:01:00,093
let's focus on the beauty
of that drive, right?

20
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,262
- That was a long...
- Hey!

21
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,162
I'm the only one that
say "ass" in this house.

22
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,799
- That's right.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,179
- Yeah, that was
a long-ass ride.

24
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,702
- It was a long-ass drive.

25
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,884
- Excuse me, gotta
go to the bathroom.

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,407
- Baby, there was
one by the door.

27
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,175
I think you should
go try to find it.

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,643
- Say what?

29
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,814
- Are you sure?
- Are y'all tripping?

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,449
- What?

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,750
- This place looks haunted.

32
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,822
- It is not haunted.

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,824
- Didn't a whole bunch
of old people die here?

34
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,905
- That's why there's a graveyard
across the street.

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,397
Mm.

36
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,702
- Go... go.

37
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,837
Go, go, go, help your
sister find a bathroom!

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,105
Get out of here, go! - Okay.

39
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,205
But if I don't come back,

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,218
just bury me in that graveyard
with the old people.

41
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,477
- Yeah, with your phone,
I'm sure.

42
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,721
- Yeah, but get a great shot
for the Gram

43
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,181
so I can at least get
some followers when I'm dead.

44
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,582
Come on.

45
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,486
- Uh, b-b-baby, it does look
a little rundown in here.

46
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,523
- Rundown? This... is tore up.

47
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,192
- Yeah, and you said your
grandfather lives here?

48
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,660
- Yeah.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,128
- How?

50
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,232
When was the last time
you came to visit him?

51
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,412
- When my grandmother died.

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,502
- It's been that long?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,837
- VINNY: Uh!
- Ah!

54
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,374
- That be two years,
six months, four hours,

55
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,341
and three days.

56
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,344
Hook me, son. [laughs]

57
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,412
Hook me, Leah.

58
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,782
- I... I'll pass.

59
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,151
- Where them little
naughty-head bastards at?

60
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,322
- Grandpa, are you
talking about my children?

61
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,325
- Yeah, them little rugrats.

62
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,836
- Hey, don't talk
about my kids like that.

63
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,362
- [laughs] Shit, you the one
call them that...

64
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,667
- Honey, do you?

65
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,936
- Well, nah, no,
no, I said... no, not that.

66
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,537
- [laughs]

67
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,839
- You know I love them.

68
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,541
- Well, where are they?

69
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,909
- They went to the bathroom.

70
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,711
- Oh, I'll be damned.

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,515
- Why you say that?
- Uh, never mind.

72
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,551
- Did you find it?

73
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,553
- Yeah, but there's
no running water.

74
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,789
- And a bucket where
the toilet used to be.

75
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,524
There is no way...
- JEREMY: What?

76
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,259
- Grandpa, what is going on?

77
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,460
And where is everybody?

78
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,839
- Well, you ain't gonna believe
this..., but check it out.

79
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,266
The health department... take a
look... closed this place down,

80
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,801
and I'm the only
one living here.

81
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,835
- What?

82
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,904
- Yeah.

83
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,749
- Whoa, wait, Pop,
you here by yourself?

84
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,508
- Yes, sir.

85
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,052
- Ah, no, I'm calling
the police, man.

86
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:29,776
That's elderly abuse.

87
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,712
- No, no, no,
I might get arrested.

88
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,313
- What?

89
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,616
- For murder.

90
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,519
- What?

91
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,779
- I'll hook the... with this.

Wait, what are you

100
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,729

00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,784
Are you okay? - Uh-uh-uh,

not... s-s-s.

Don't disrespect the

123
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,761
Yeah, I'm fine, why you ask?

124
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:14,130
- Well, why you think
you murdered somebody?

125
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,999
- Well, I don't think.

126
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,001
I know.

127
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,736
I hooked that...

- [chuckles]

130
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,886

"I forget everything" disease.

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,445
- BOTH: [laughing]

132
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,413
- I am warning you two.

133
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,249
- Ssh, don't get me grounded.

134
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,884
You know she likes
to take phones away.

135
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,552
- And I will right now.

136
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,498
- I don't have mine. Do you...
- Me neither.

137
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,257

- Mm-hmm.

138
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,227
- Alright, Grandpa.

139
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,163
Cut the crap, man,
what's going on?

140
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,432
- Okay. [clears throat]

141
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:54,137
The year was 1947.

142
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:58,275
Satchel Paige was playing
football for

143
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,545
the American White People
...League.

144
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,050
- What are you talking about?

145
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,253
- History,...

146
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,155
- Hey, do not use that
language in front of...

147
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,124
- Them... no...
- LEAH: Grandpa...

148
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,893
- BOTH: [laughing]

149
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:21,398
- Okay, let's see, um, there
was seven of us here, right?

150
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,101
Then one person died, and
then another person died,

151
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,737
then another pers... that was
3 people died in 20 minutes.

152
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,873
Just bam, bam, bam
dead, just like that.

153
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:37,180
Then the health department
brought their ass in here

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,749
for some reason and
shut the place down.

155
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,186
Now, the old lady who was
working, before she died,

156
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,821
she sold the place.

157
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,456
And here we are.

158
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,026
- Who is we?

159
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,063
- Well, uh, me and my plants.

160
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,466
- What?

161
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,435
- Yeah, well, don't tell nobody,

162
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,104
but I grow weed in the backyard

163
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,239
behind the dumpster.

164
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,974
I got a... - Grandpa,

165
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,208
that's illegal, man.

166
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,710
- Boy, that ain't illegal.

167
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,045
I got a license
in here somewhere.

168
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:13,416
- You do not have a
license to grow weed, man.

169
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,419
- Yes, I do have a license, boy.

170
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,754
Show what I'm talking about.

171
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,524
I got it from... I got it
from a one-eyed rapper.

172
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:23,193
We was in business together.

173
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,704
- That's Fetty Wap, mm-hmm.
- Fetty Wap.

174
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,997
- No, no, his name was Wink.

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,067
- [chuckles]

176
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,246
- I don't care what his name
is, man, that's illegal.

177
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,071
- Not here in Colorado.

178
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,109
- Wait, wait, wait,
ain't we in Georgia?

179
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,043
- Minor details.

180
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,745
...your map, son.

181
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,625
- Grandpa, are you trying
to go to jail or what?

182
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,286
- Boy, if I go to jail,
they'll tear my ass up.

183
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,188
I can't even wipe
with this thing.

184
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,857
[sniffs] That's funky. - Ew.

185
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,859
- [gags]

186
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,194
- [laughs]

187
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:58,534
- Yeah, he definitely slipping.

188
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,896
Slipping. - Mm, for real.

189
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,598
- Keep it up.

190
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,042
- Uh, she's gonna
take away my phone.

191
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,602
- Okay, no see, I'm gonna
have it disconnected.

192
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,222
- Uh, you know that
is the death of me.

193
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,605
- Well, then stop it.

194
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,440
- I won't say another word.
- Thank you.

195
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:12,685
- Well, I don't know why you're
worried.

196
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,944
There's no reception out here.

197
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,278
- Wait, what?
- Yep.

198
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:16,713
- No, what about the Wi-Fi?

199
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,914
- Nope.

200
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,559
- What the hell?
- Oh, I wish you would!

201
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,917
I wish you would! - Oh!

202
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,353
- [screaming]

203
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,890
Baby, I'm
dirty, I'm dirty, I'm dirty.

204
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,091
- I'm sorry.

205
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:31,761
- Why the hell these...
Keep asking for waffles?

206
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,130
They're making me hungry.
All this weed I done smoked.

207
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,237
- Grandpa, it's Wi-Fi.

208
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,173
- Why the... do I care?

209
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,610
- Grandpa!

210
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,846
- Oh, oh, you talking
about the internets.

211
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,917
- Yes. What literally all people
have in this day and age.

212
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,419
- [chuckles] Well, you know,
back in my day,

213
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,697
what we had...
- Yeah, yeah, we know,

214
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,689
we know, two cans and string.

215
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,802
- Let me ask you something, son.

216
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,095
What one of these kids you
don't give a damn about?

217
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,864
- It's you.

218
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,034
- Yeah, my son.

219
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,454
- 'Cause I'll kill
his ass for ya.

220
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,604
[laughs]
- JEREMY: Alright, y'all stop.

221
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,215
- You better tell him.
- Hold on, hold on,

222
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,541
hold on, Grandpa.

223
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,318
Look, we need to get back to
the subject at hand, okay?

224
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,611
- I'll be damned, did she
just say the subject at hand?

225
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,716
Boy, you two-handed people
make my ass sick.

226
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,087
That's me giving you the finger.

227
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,701
- Grandpa, look, man,
nobody's supposed to leave you

228
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,085
here alone,
I'm calling the police.

229
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,964
I want the owner arrested.
- No, the hell you don't!

230
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:42,064
- Yes, I do.

231
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,868
- [chuckles] Grandson,
do you love me?

232
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,873
What the hell take you so long?

233
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,893
- I had to think about
it, yeah, I love you, man.

234
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,945
- Okay, well, then
don't do that.

235
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,980
- Why not?

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,950
- Let's just say if you
love me, you wouldn't do it.

237
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,253
- No, I'm calling them
because I love you.

238
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,289
- What your dad trying to
do is turn me into the man!

239
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,026
- Man, what are
you talking about?

240
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,126
- No, Grandpa, listen.

241
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,195
He's right, okay?

242
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,997
- Then don't let
his ass do that.

243
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,199
- No, okay, we need to
call the authorities.

244
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,334
- Well, I'll be damned.

245
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:21,471
Did she just say "authorities"?

246
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,440
- Yes, she did.

247
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,177
- Okay, what black woman
married to a black man

248
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:31,181
in this day and time uses
the word "authority"?

249
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,084
- I guess this one.

250
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,787
Hurt your hand
again, didn't you?

251
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,590
Squats, baby. - [giggles]

252
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,725
- Buns of steel.

253
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,194
- Mom and Dad, gross!

254
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:46,563
- No, no, Grandpa, I'm calling...
- No, no, no!

255
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,731
- Why not?

256
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,633
- Okay, you want
the owner arrested?

257
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,601
- Yes.
- The real damn owner?

258
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,769
- Yes, man.
- Yes!

259
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,604
- You want his ass locked up?
- Yes.

260
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,249
- Yes, you shouldn't be
here alone like this, man.

261
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,440
This is wrong.

262
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,276
- Well, damn it, that's me.

263
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:00,677
- What?

264
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,114
- I'm the owner.

265
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,183
- What?
- Yeah!

266
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,485
- No, no, you did what?

267
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,588
- I got a hook hand,
but your ass can't hear.

268
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:15,692
- No, man, I can hear, I'm just
trying to make sure

269
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,794
I heard what I thought I heard.

270
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,429
- I bought the place.

271
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,730
- How?

272
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,834
- With money, dumbass!

273
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,102
- Grandpa, how did you buy it?

274
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,072
- Well, okay, you know
that stuff they call money?

275
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,875
That you use to
exchange stuff with?

276
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,445
If you have a girl over,
you leave like maybe 100,

277
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:36,923
then you say,
"That's way too much,"

278
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:42,285
so you take 50
back... and then you says,

279
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,622
"My wife and hand sanitizer
in the other room,

280
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:48,091
and get your ass up
before my wife get here."

281
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,320
- Please don't talk like
that in front of my kids.

282
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,831
- Are you really
saying this to me?

283
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,199
- I can't believe your ass.

284
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,569
Are you really asking
me what "bought" is?

285
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,080
- Babe, you better get him
before I bust him

286
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,372
in the head. - Don't do it.

287
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,632
Don't do it, babe, don't do it.
You got it, you got it.

288
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,977
- Just one hook, but
I can hear you,...!

289
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,148
- Grandpa, I was
not asking you that.

290
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,051
- Okay, then what
was you asking me?

291
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,688
- Grandpa, you know
what I'm saying.

292
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,690
- Tell your daddy
I bought the place.

293
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:23,326
- Dad! He bought the place!

294
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,494
- Boy, I know what he's
saying, don't play with me!

295
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,479
What are you talking about?

296
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,702
- Again, I bought it.

297
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,139
- With what money?

298
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:39,709
- Uuuuuh...

299
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:42,179
let's see, uh...

300
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:48,985
ah...

301
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,988
well, what would have
been your inheritance.

302
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:55,025
- Ain't this some...?

303
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,927
- Honey, honey, honey,
it's okay, it's okay.

304
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,905
- No, no, that money was
supposed to be for the kids.

305
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,964
- It's okay, it's okay, it's
okay, baby, it's okay.

306
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,433
- Wait, that money was
supposed to be for us?

307
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,902
- Oh! Oh, hell...
- Sshh, ssh, sssh.

308
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,304
- PHILIP: Oh, check it.

309
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,707
- Boy!

310
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:14,377
You couldn't wait for your
old grandmomma to die.

311
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,947
She was an old, amazing...

312
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:19,248
- Grandpa!

313
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,852
- No, man, she couldn't
...a blimp.

314
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,388
- BOTH: [laughs]

315
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,891
- JEREMY: Grandpa!

316
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,036
- Grandpa, please, I asked you
to stop talking about stuff

317
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,204
like that in front of my kids.

318
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,772
- I'm talking about
riding on the blimp.

319
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,599
They saw your grandmomma
with her big ass.

320
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,734
Her big ol' ass.

321
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,569
Nice ass.

322
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,371
Hook that ass.

323
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,739
- Get your Granddaddy.

324
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,639
- Stop talking about my
grandmother like that.

325
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,109
- No, go on and say it.

326
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,713
You glad your grandmomma dead.

327
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,982
- That is not true.
I loved Grandma.

328
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,084
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

329
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,253
- Well, here's a shocker.

330
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:59,756
Newsflash.

331
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:03,927
She left me the money to
give to your... ass daddy.

332
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,364
And I bought the place.

333
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:09,966
- Why would you do that?

334
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,203
- Because.
- What?

335
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,272
- Because you're a spoiled brat.

336
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,674
- Grandpa.

337
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,377
- Boy, the only reason you
brought your ass to Colorado

338
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:22,379
was to get money.

339
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,080
- We're in Georgia.

340
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,248
- Again.

341
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,117
- Didn't I tell you
about them punk-ass maps?

342
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,487
Stop listening to white people.

343
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,790
The Earth is flat!

344
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,760
- Oh my gosh.

345
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,395
- He clearly did
not go to school.
