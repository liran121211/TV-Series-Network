is really all my fault.

176
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,823
If I had kept my job...

177
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,159
- Listen, it is not your fault
that those stupid people

178
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,228
laid you off.
- Yeah, I know that.

179
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,897
- Well, it's kinda his fault.

180
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,566
- Grandpa!

181
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,570
- If he had been more
productive, showed his value,

182
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,538
they wouldn't have
laid his ass off.

183
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:39,309
- Baby, she is
being a selfish teenager.

184
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,878
And it is wrong for her
to make you feel bad.

185
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,414
- Baby, you know how I... look,
I just hate to upset her.

186
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:45,748
That's my princess.

187
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,153
- Uh, he don't like to have
his daughter upset at him.

188
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:52,222
- Look, I just hate
disappointing her.

189
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,423
- Oooh!

190
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,958
That's why she like that.

191
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,826
- Grandpa!
- No, no, no.

192
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:00,263
She like that 'cause you all
give her every damn thing.

193
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,131
I had nothing!

194
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,499
- Here we go.

195
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,935
- When I came to this
country, on a banana boat...

196
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,035
- Grandpa.

197
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,338
- What?

198
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:11,674
- Ain't no banana boats
coming from Mississippi.

199
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:15,812
- [laughs] Boy,
I'm from Jamaica.

200
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,946
- Wah!

201
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,657
Grandpa, I did not
know you were Jamaican.

202
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,216
- Yea, mon.
- No, no.

203
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:24,387

00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,788
- Hello? Hello?

205
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,526
Your kid is in the room.
That's nasty.

206
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,626
- Forgot about you.

207
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,862
Um... - [laughs]

208
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,832
- Grandpa, so
you... you speak Jamaican?

209
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,535
- [in Jamaican accent] No, well,
see, me left as a little boy

210
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,436

me learn to speak the language.

212
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,644

213
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:51,181
or don't they speak
English in Jamaica?

214
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,016
- VINNY: Ooh.
- You right.

215
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,217
- Is he still in the room?

216
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,785
- Yeah, I'm right here.

217
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:56,886
- Then be gone.

218
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,888
- [laughs] Yeh, mon.
- Alright, now, mon.

219
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,192
Anyway, where was I?

220
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,294
- Uh, on a banana boat from...

221
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,929
- From the Bahamas!

222
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,230
[laughs]

223
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,765
- Wait, what?
- Look...

224
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:10,133
- And I remember so well, mon.

225
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,801
Me had nothing.

226
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,903
Me had no shoes.

227
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,839

228
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,941
Me was butt naked.

229
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,911
Get off the boat butt naked.

230
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,380
Everything was
swinging in the wind.

00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:25,615
Swinging.

232
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,817

must be from Jamaica."

I say, "Yah, man.

234
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,754
That's where I'm from."

236
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:34,724

yourself, I'm freezing."

238

I mean, what woman wants to be
cool with everything a man says?

338
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:08,431
- Women are not supposed to be
cool with everything

339

- Don't...

- Don't what?

346

00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,715
Grandpa, tell me.

348
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:28,518
- Okay, the Bible says...

349
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,819
- You don't know the Bible.

350
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,121

The Bible says
in... second Geronimo...

352
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:38,895
- Geronimo?

353
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:43,866
-... Alexander 19, 47, 38 verse.

354
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:49,372
If you grow it... they will come.

355
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,240
- Right.

356
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,942
You should leave, Grandpa.

357
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,082
- Grandpa, don't leave me.

358
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,612
- VINNY: [laughs]
See, your problem, boy,

359
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:59,349
is you can't handle
the little woman.

360
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,616
- What did you say?

361
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,885
- Don't, uh... don't repeat it.

362
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,689
- No, you just called
me a little woman.

363
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,958
- I thought women liked
to be called little.

364
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,893
- It's Me Too, Grandpa.

365
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,896
- Watch... watch me fix this...
Watch me.

366
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,866
I called you little.

367
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,002
You wouldn't want me to
call you a big woman.

368
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,873
You see, I called you a
little woman as in small.

369
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,942
As in you've lost weight.

370
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,444
As in I've noticed
you're smaller.

371
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:31,047
You lost weight.

372
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:32,882
- You recognize it?
- VINNY: Yes.

373
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,985
- Honey, this snatch works?
- Yes, yes, I'm seeing it.

374
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,288
- Stop it. [laughs] WW.

375
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,624

376
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,494
You see me fix that -?

377
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,804
- How the hell did you do that?

378
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,397
- Boy, with a quickness.

379
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:55,238

380
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,673

Go on, I'm listening.

383
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,844
- No, you know, look.

384
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,013
It's just easy to talk to...

385
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,691
- I just don't want
him to think women are...

386
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,026
- That women are difficult.
- Yes.

387
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,619
- I get it. 'Cause you're not.

388

389
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,589

390
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,025
- A comment like that can.

391
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,728

396
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,371

that little girl.

397
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,073
- Where did she go?

398
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,984

around here somewhere.

Let's go. - Uh, no.

402
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,914
I should do this by myself.

403

You know, women are
so... difficult, you know?

404

406
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,320
Look, stop playing.
- Oh, I gotta get over it?

407

Twenty years.
