{\an8}- You think you killed
your grandpa. [laughing]

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,213
{\an8}- You think I'm kidding.
We were boxing.

3
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,305
- Come on!
- I had to defend myself!

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,108
- The man is 87 years old.
- Ooh! Come on!

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,277
- I don't care,
I knocked his ass out.

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,055
- Do you think they're thinking
of staying here?

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,323
- My life is flashing
before my eyes.

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,848
- This is where old people
go to die.

9
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,159
- Where is he?
- He's over there.

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,560
- What am I gonna do
without civilization?

11
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,019
- Ah!
- We can't let them do this!

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,399
- He can't be dead if he got up.

13
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,856
- Jesus did it.
- He definitely ain't Jesus.

14
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,167
- You're gonna wanna come
and see this.

15
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,826
It's Grandpa,
he's calling police,

16
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,286
he said he's being abused.
- What?!

17
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,795
- I told you we should've left.

18
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,930
- ♪

19
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,277
- Grandpa.

20
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,545
- No!

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,849
- Grandpa...
- No, keep your ass

22
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,251
away from me!

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,755
I can't believe you did that!

24
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,224
Bastard!

25
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,195
Sucker-punch a old man?!

26
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:59,468
Mother... ooh! Ooh!

27
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:00,669
- I'm sorry.

28
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,072
- No. You hit me!

29
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:07,676
Sorry bitch-ass
hit me like that.

30
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,378
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

31
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,815
- Yes! Your dad hit me
when I wasn't looking.

32
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,617
I looked this way, he hit me,

33
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:17,052
had my arm up like that,
I ain't see it coming.

34
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,754
Knocked my ass out.

35
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:22,224
- Wait, wait, wait, you hit him?

36
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:26,161
- Yes, he did.
Sucker-punched my ass.

37
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:29,198
- It was a reflex, Son.

38
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,942
Look, you know me,
you know I got that right

39
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,134
and that left.

40
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,870

42
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:38,841
- No, do you know how many
hits I would have right now

43
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,276
if I was able to get online?

44
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,121
- I know how many hits
your daddy gave me,

45
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,413
the old bastard!

46
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,517
- Do you know how many hits
you would have if you did that?

47
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:51,987
- I don't think y'all
are talking about likes.

48
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,490
- Your dad is trying to kill me!

49
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:57,026
- Pop, if I was trying
to kill you,

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,203
I'd just switch
your Wednesday medicine

51
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:00,229
with your Thursday medicine.

52
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,431
- No, dammit,
you knocked me over the sofa!

53
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:07,169
- That was a accident.
- No, it wasn't.

54
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,172
- Yes, it was, man, I'm sorry.
- Wait, Dad, Dad.

55
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,875
Did he just say you knocked him
over the sofa?

56
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:16,845
- Boy, I just told you,
I got that right and that left.

57
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:18,847
- He did tell us.

58
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:22,051
- Yes, he did.

59
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,619
- Wow.
- What?!

60
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,256
- And you're able to stand
after all that?

61
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,359
- I'm barely standing.

62
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,437
- [chuckles] Yeah, 'cause them
old bitter bones of yours

63
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,030
are like... [squeaks]
- [laughing]

64
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,565
- Say it one more time.

65
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,835
- Look, I'm sorry,
but when you walk,

66
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,337
your bones rattle.

67
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,607
- So will you!

68
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,409
When I put this hook
gently in your ass.

69
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:52,314
- There is a law
against that, Grandpa.

70
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,250
- Not if it's gently.

71
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:57,462
- JEREMY: Look, Grandpa,
put the phone down.

72
00:02:57,486 --> 00:03:00,956
- I'm dialing.
- Why are you all freaking out?

73
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,726
There's no reception here.

74
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:05,861
- I have reception.

75
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,499
Yeah, y'all with all
that digital shit,

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,767
this analog.

77
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,470
- It's still too many numbers.

78
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,772
- I had this battery
for a month and a half.

79
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,410
So what if you get
cancer in your ear?

80
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,848
This shit right here works!

81
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:30,653
- What is that?
- That is a phone, little girl.

82
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,257
- From what year?
- Don't worry about what year.

83
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,962
- That looks like a VCR.
You remember those?

84
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,464
- Do we remember those.

85
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,199

Bingo, sound like
good parenting to me.

00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,205
what is that,
good grandparenting?

I wouldn't do it.

No, no, no, because you're old.

00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,867
I felt like his grandma.

175
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:15,303
The hook came off,
I had to pick it up

176
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,539
with this hand,
put it back on...

177
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,842
It was awful. I went flying!

178
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,512
Like his grandma.

179
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:27,616
With her legs in the air.
Twerking.

180
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,486
- I'm really sorry.

181
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,890
- I mean, who in the hell
would do that to a old-ass man?

182
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,227
- My dad!
- You're damn right.

183
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,563
- Yeah, and he does it
to little kids, too.

184
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,466
- Hello.

185
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,536
Y'all realize I am
in the room, right?

186
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:48,770
- You're going to jail.

187
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,907
- Look, look, man, hey.
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,975
- Don't. Talk. To me.

189
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,410
- Okay.

190
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,312
- Just wait 'til
the police get here.

191
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,756
- Grandpa, you didn't call
the police.

192
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,482
- Yes, I did call the police!

193
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,284
- Okay, you think that was wise?

194
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,086
- You think it was wise
for him to hit me?

195
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,887
- Okay, see...

196
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:08,757
I think both of y'all
were wrong.

197
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,602
- Ain't no way
in hell I'm wrong,

198
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,528
I'm 70 years old.

199
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,331
- You're really, like, 87,
I thought.

200
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,532
- Yes.

201
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,369
- How the hell am I wrong?

202
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:23,372
When you're old,
everything you do is right.

203
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:26,241
- I don't... I don't think
that's... that's right.

204
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,778
- Well, just wait
until the police get here.

205
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,847
- But Grandpa, you didn't
call the police.

206
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,415
- Yes, I did!

207
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,185
- You know what? Okay, well,
what about your little, um,

208
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,355
"sit-ee-ation" in the backyard?

209
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,791
- What "sit-ee-ation"
in the backyard?

210
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:47,496
- Oh, you little puff-puff pass.
[inhales] [coughs]

211
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:50,298
- JEREMY: Pass that.
- [coughing]

212
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,734
- That's outrageous.
- [coughing]

213
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,404
- Oh, hell.

214
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,572
That is legal in Colorado.

215
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,444
- This is Georgia.
- Georgia.

216
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:04,913
- Oh, hell.

217
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:08,350
- Uh, and I hear
the police outside.

218
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,651
- Goddamn.

219
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,454
- ♪

220
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,709
- Get rid of them!
- Grandpa Vinny, you called 'em.

221
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,268
- Oh, no, I made a mistake!

222
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,170
- Okay, it's too late now,
Grandpa.

223
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,838
- [cries] I made a mistake!

224
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,507
- You called 'em!

225
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,077
- We got to hide my stuff!

226
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,645
- Grandpa Vinny.

227
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:31,147
You don't need to be
worried about that anyway.

228
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,883
- [cries]
And I can't go to jail!

229
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,187
- Oh, but you want me to go.

230
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,855
- I can't go 'cause
I'm a virgin.

231
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,624
- What?

232
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,769
- Yeah, we remember your
little experiment in college.

233
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,663
- [stuttering] Grandpa Vinny.

234
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,833
- With candles and everything,
we heard about it.

235
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,267
- Stop it.

236
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,836
- I'm sorry.

237
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,005
All I'm saying is your husband's
ready for it, I'm not.

238
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,374
- Okay! Enough!

239
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,776
- He's strong, he can fight
them off, they gon' get me!

240
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:06,049
His [bleep] is tight.
Mine is loose!

241
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:10,687
[crying]

242
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:14,090
I can't use my underwear
to go to the bathroom!

243
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,092
I think I just shit myself now!

244
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,131
We got to hide my stuff!

245
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,535
Why did y'all call the police?!

246
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:28,438
- He's tripping.
- No, why did you?!

247
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:31,074
- Grandpa, do you not remember
you called them?

248
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,311
- I did?

249
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:36,679
- Yes. Yes.

250
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,615
- Damn, I gotta stop
smoking that shit.

251
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,819
- Wait, you were smoking
that shit?

252
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,158
- I have to, son, you know,
I got cataracts in my knees.

253
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,963
- So this is why you've
been acting so silly.

254
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,098
- I wasn't acting silly,

255
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,001
you're the one who threw me
over the sofa.

256
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:00,970
- Oh, oh, so now...
So now I "threw" him over.

257
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,672
- Yes, you did.

258
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,309
- Grandpa Vinny, that is enough,
the police are outside.

259
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,611
- Aw, damn, we got
to hide my stuff!

260
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,182
- Ooh, I wonder if they
have reception.

261
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,894
- Look, sit down,
sit down, okay? Sit down.

262
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:16,019
- Oh, Lord.

263
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,922
I'mma make a run for it.

264
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,893
Y'know, I kinda like the way
you grab me like that, you know.

265
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,000
- You're not gonna get that far
on that bad hip of yours.

266
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:34,604
- He did the hook. [laughs]
- Yeah.

267
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,273
- [laughing] Boy don't talk
about my hip.

268
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,853
- You talk about it
all the time.

269
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,513
- Well, it's my hip
and I can talk about it.

270
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,315
- Alright, my bad.

271
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,592
- Grandpa, you just stay seated.

272
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,918
- I can't, now my hip done
locked up on me.

273
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,055
- And how did that happen?

274
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,891
- Well, that only happened
one other time that I enjoyed.

275
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,895
- What... what were you doing?

276
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,830
- Me and your grandmama
had prune juice

277
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,832
all over our bodies, right?

278
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,905
And, uh, we was doing
some grown folk business.

279
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,441
Eating prunes and, you know,
just...

280
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,676
that's why my ass is loose.

281
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,580
- Let me stop you right there.

282
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,549
Because I don't think
I need to hear that.

283
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,057
- And the second time
it happened was

284
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:26,790
when your daddy grabbed me
by the neck and the hook

285
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,460
and he threw me over the sofa.

286
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,971
- It's crazy how this story
keeps changing,

287
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,797
now I'm grabbing him by the neck
and the hook

288
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,265
and I threw him over the sofa.

289
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,600
- Yes, you did.

290
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,545
- Well, if you keep it up,
I'mma take the hook off

291
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,680
and I'mma beat your ass with it.

292
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,405
- [doorbell rings]

293
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:45,508
- Ociffer! Ociffer!
You heard him!

294
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:46,910
- What's going on?

295
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:52,348
- Grandpa, it's "Officer."
"Officer."

296
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,784
- Shut the hell up.

297
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:56,753
I know what the hell I'm saying.

298
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,288
- Tell him the truth.

299
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,323
- [softspoken]
I'm dead, Officer,

300
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,092
he... he tried to kill me.

301
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:08,098
It all started back in 1937.

302
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,601
His daddy used to beat me, too.

303
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,039
They've been trying
to kill me for years.

304
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,043
Gene passed on to his son.

305
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,612
- O... Officer.
- I... I'm talking to him, ma'am.

306
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,847
- LEAH: Oh.

307
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,987
- Tell him the truth.
- I did. He tried to kill me.

308
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:37,260
He grabbed me... and threw me
over the sofa.

309
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,428
So sad.

310
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,830
- No, I didn't.

311
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,565
- Are you living here?

312
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,701
- Yes, I live here all by
myself.

313
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,036
Me and my hook.

314
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,641
- Wasn't this place closed?
- It was closed, this place.

315
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,843
I'd like to talk about him
hurting me

316
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,912
and cutting off my arm.

317
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,083
- Grandpa!

318
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,652
- Who are you to him?

319
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,790
- His grandson, unfortunately.

320
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,291
- And what happened?

321
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,693
- [yelling] Dammit...
[softspoken] Dammit, I told you.

322
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,764
Before you got here,
I had two hands.

323
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:17,434
He cut one off
and sewed the other one on.

324
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,907
And threw me over the sofa.

325
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,577
- I'm talking to him.
- Okay. Alright.

326
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,513
- Sir, we were boxing.

327
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,482
- You were boxing this old man?!

328
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,852
- Who the...?! [soft-spoken]
Who... who are you calling old?

329
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:42,025
- See? He started getting
aggressive just like right now.

330
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,095
- Oh, uh, well, I was now, huh?

331
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,864
- He kept hitting me,
and then finally, I hit him back

332
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,699
and he flew over the sofa.

333
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,770
- With my legs in the air.

334
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,305
Like his grandma.

335
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,708
L-shaped casket.

336
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:03,079
Couldn't close it.

337
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,482
She had this leg
sticking out the ground.

338
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,051
- O... Okay, okay.

339
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:11,654
Do you wanna press charges?
- Yes, I do.

340
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,890
- You can't send him to jail,
Grandpa.

341
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,870
- Yes, I can, and I'm...
She don't speak for me,

342
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:19,129
I don't even know who she is.

343
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,297
He tried to send me
to the Lord, Officer.

344
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,334
- Okay, ain't nothing about you
going to the Lord, Grandpa.

345
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,602
- Hell.

346
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:28,538
- He doesn't wanna
press charges, Officer.

347
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,573
- She don't... she don't
speak for me.

348
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,976
- Grandpa!

349
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,711
- Come on.
- That's right, take him.

350
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,646
Take his ass.
Take him, take his ass.

351
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,748
- Pops!
- Take him.

352
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:43,753
- You sure you wanna do this?
- I'm 100% positive.

353
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:46,056
- Officer.
- Yes?

354
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:51,561
- I think you need to take
a look around this place.

355
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,930
- OFFICER: Say what?
- LEAH: Mm-hmm.

356
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,102
I think you need to do, like,
a... a... an unofficial search.

357
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,405
- No. No.
- Yeah, specifically

358
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:03,840
in the backyard. - LEAH: Yes.

359
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,443
- Yeah.
- LEAH: Yeah, backyard.

360
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,348
- You, uh, you really
gon' do this?

361
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,720
- For this man right here?
Oh, baby, we like Jay and Bey.

362
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,354
- Her rock.
- His rock.

363
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,590
I sure will.

364
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,392
- Which way is the backyard?

365
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:27,297
- Shall I show him?
- Yeah... um...

366
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,899
Okay, okay, okay, I... I don't
wanna press charges.

367
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,904
- You don't.
- No, I... I changed my mind.

368
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:38,675
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

369
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,786
Yeah, just get on out of here,
we don't need you here anyway,

370
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,079
we don't like police.

371
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:46,049
- Oh, well, okay,
I need to know something.

372
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,685
- What?
- Why are you in this place?

373
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:49,785
It's closed.

374
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,021
- I own this place.

375
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:55,158
- You own it?
- Yes.

376
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,327
- Oh... Vinny.

377
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:02,999
- Yeah?
- Yeah. [chuckling] Yeah.

378
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,736
Yeah, we heard of you.

379
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,538
- Oh, what you heard?

380
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,307
- That you were selling weed
to the people who lived here.

381
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:18,815
- That was before I had
the hook and I had two hands.

382
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,619
I... I'm old now, I'm having
my old life,

383
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,320
I don't do that no more.

384
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:30,326
- Uh-huh. Well, I'm glad
this place is closed.

385
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:33,463
- We... why... why do you say that,
sir?

386
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,065
- It was an eyesore.

387
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,233
- Really?

388
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:42,005
- Yeah. Someone tried to buy it
and reopen it, but, uh...

389
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:45,442
[chuckling] Whoa, this
is gonna take a lot of work.

390
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,979
- [chuckles] Well, I own it,
and it's not for sale.

391
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,116
- Is everything okay here?

392
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:54,551
- Yeah, everything's okay.

393
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,120
- Call us if you need us.

394
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,622
- Won't nobody be calling you.

395
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,157
- Thank you, Officer.

396
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:03,069
- And be careful, I'm sending
the health inspector

397
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:04,928
now that I know you're living
here.

398
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:07,429
- Damn.

399
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:11,034
- Y'all have a good day.
- LEAH: Thank you.

400
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:21,127
- ♪

401
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,930
- Not the health inspector!

402
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,132
Them damn health inspectors!

403
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,167
They want meat
in the refrigerator,

404
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,203
can't have no rats or roaches.

405
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,638
Get on my damn nerves.

406
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,318
- Grandpa,
we don't have to worry

407
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,411
about the health inspectors,
this place is closed.

408
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:42,148
- No, I can't let them
find my backyard prize, girl!

409
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,818
- You will be fine, okay?

410
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,055
- No, I can't
let 'em find my stash.

411
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:53,359
- Well, maybe I need to, uh...
- [yelling]

412
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,795
- Call 'em back.
- No, don't call nobody,

413
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,196
don't call them on back.

414
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,700
- Mm-hmm. One.
- One. Yeah, baby.

415
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,569
- Oh, that's right, they come
fast, don't wanna press it.

416
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,673
- Alright, alright, listen,
listen, y'all got to help me.

417
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,643
- Help you do what?
- Y'all have got to stay here.

418
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,614
And help me get this place open.

419
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,685
- Hmm...

420
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,556
- Uh, stay where?

421
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,561
- I think he said here.

422
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,332
- In this place?

423
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,336
With no reception?

424
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,570
- Yeah.

425
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,406
- With the roaches and the rats?

426
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,576
- And the buckets.

427
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,413
- Okay. I'm gonna die.

428
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,249
- So dramatic.

429
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,113
- [air whooshing]
