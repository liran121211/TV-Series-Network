Thank you.

It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

No. Uh-uh. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

Sorry, Monica.
I'm really happy you got promoted...

178
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,407
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

179
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,617
No.

180
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,537
Rachel just had that little salad...

181
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,082
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

182
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,209
Okay, Pheebs.

183
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,504
How about we'll each
just pay for what we had, okay?

184
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,132
- It's no big deal.
- Not for you.

185
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,180
All right, what's going on?

186
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,516
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

187
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,895
- It'll just make everybody uncomfortable.
- Oh, fine. All right, fine.

- What? Whoa, whoa.
- You can tell us.

189
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,275
Yeah, hello? It's us.
All right? We'll be fine.

190

Ahem. Okay, um...

...sometimes you guys don't get that,

We don't have as much money as you.

- Okay.
- I hear you.

195
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
We can talk about that.

196
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,228
Well, then...

197
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,147
...let's.

198
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:38,196
Well, um, I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

199
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,573
- That's because you have it.
- That's a good point.

200
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,663
So, um, how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

201
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,041
Because it's always something, you know?
Like with Monica's new job...

202
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,086
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

203
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,213
What? Whoa, hey.

204
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,926
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

205
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,011
There's gonna be a hoopla?

206
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:09,102
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing and it's...

207
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,814
If it makes anybody feel better,
we can just forget the thing...

208
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,066
...and we'll just do the gift.

209
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,902
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

210
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,906
No, the thing was we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

211
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,869

I can catch them on the radio.

...and the important thing
is that we all be together.

- All of us.
- Together.

I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

222
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,450
Oh, it's like a skit.

223
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,871
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

224
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,415
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

225
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,421
We switched meat suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

226
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,842
But wait, there's more.
Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?

227
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,930
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

Come on.

229
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,018

Could you be less enthused?

235

Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

236
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,499
But it just feels like...

237
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,000
Like?

238

- Charity.
- Charity?

239

We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

240
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,844
But, Ross, you have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feel about this big.

241
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,013
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

242

What? I don't understand. I mean,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

244
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,233
Maybe that's just how you feel.

Oh.

- We never should have talked about this.

I'm gonna pass on the concert...

...because I'm just not in a very
Hootie place right now.

- Me neither.
- Me too.

when you said that?

always have to do everything together?

when somebody else says it.

biting her lip to stop from screaming.
