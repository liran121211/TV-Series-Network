Like the way I do with Julie.

343
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,329
Was there a "second of all"?

344
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,707
Um...

345
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,129
No, um, I think that was the whole "all."

346
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,967
I gotta go. Okay?

347
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,636
- Okay.
- Thanks.

348
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,846
Okay.

349
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,187
No, I swear to God, Dad!

350
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,481
That's not how they measure pants!

351
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,492
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

352
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,536
- Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.
- Really?

353
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,247
- Yeah. You wanna do it now?
- Great!

354
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,124
- Okay.
- Okay.

355
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,875
See you.

356
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,586
Okay, I just wanna make
really sure this time.

357
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,838
Uh-huh. Ahem.

358
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,342
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

359
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,469
No.

360
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,392
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's Roddy McDowall.

361
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,354
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

362
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,149
- Oh! Yeah, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?

363
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,234
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
