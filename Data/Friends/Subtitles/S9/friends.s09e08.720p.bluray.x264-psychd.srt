could stop me or anything...

you don't seem connected to the baby.

168
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,377
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

169
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,840
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.

170
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,344
I mean, that you would
trust me with your child.

171
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,138
I mean, we all know
that Monica and I have been...

172
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,641
...trying to have a baby of our own.

173
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:30,021
You know, I've had my doubts
about my skills as a father, but...

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,608
That you two...

175

- That you two...
- This guy?

Okay, it's time for dinner.

178
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,583
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...

179
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,671
...and it's very expensive,
so please be careful.

Okay, just to be clear, comedy with
the plates will not be well-received.

Hey!

183
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,737
How come my plate's less fancy
than everyone else's?

184

Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

185
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,744
No, honey. That's a special plate.

186
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,622
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.

187
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,960
I can't believe I won!

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,214
You know, this is such a slap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...

189
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,343
...and you would give your baby
to these strangers over me.

190
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,054
Monica is Ross' sister.

191
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,392
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

192
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,353
That was me.

followed Rachel around like a puppy...

Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

Okay, listen, I know you're having
a bit of a family crisis...

196
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,790
...but you don't have to take it out
on the plates.

197
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,793
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...

198
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,880
...should cut their food like this:

199
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,093
Now, see? This way,
you protect the plates...

200
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,346
...and let's face it, you have fun.

201
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,892
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die...

202
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,896
...and the crazy plate lady dies...

203
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,108
...then do I get the baby?
- No, if crazy plate lady...

204
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,698
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?

205
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,454
- Well, actually...
- Actually what?

206
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,542
It's just...
It's just that in that case...

207
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,627
...then Emma would go
to my parents.

208
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,255
- What?
- Hurts, doesn't it?

209
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,011
Who has to die for me to get her?

210
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,856
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

211
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,483
No, that is not what we're saying.

it is that killed the three of you!

the, you know, fun parent.

Yeah, and we wanna make sure
Emma also has someone like Monica...

218
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,928
...who's more of a disciplinarian.

219
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,973
Someone who can be firm and strict.

220
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,726

221
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,354
No, you're all about the fun.

222
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,197
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?

223
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,117
No. You both are equally capable.

224
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,870
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.

225
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,916
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died...

226
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,293
...she'd have to give her up.

227
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,588
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

I lie better than that, right?

00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,430
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.

230
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,684
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...

...gets taken away from me?

233
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,114
- You disappeared after dinner.
- Did somebody miss me?

Ross and Rachel don't know
what they're saying.

236

It's not like they're so responsible.

237
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,710
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a five-year-old condom.

238
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,549
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never will be.

No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.

Yeah, but it's not who I am.

worried about having a kid. And it's true.

- I don't know it.

I think you'll be an amazing dad.

"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

"You're grounded"?

"No shoes on the furniture!"

The producer from Days left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.

250
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,349

at me. And they all got to meet Santa!

and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

253
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,153

because you had a family emergency.

- No, nothing with a raccoon!

- Wait, what are you doing?
- Setting the table.

to use the fancy china for dessert too.

blow our noses on my wedding dress.

know anything about disciplining a child.

You didn't come and visit me when
I was in the hospital having the baby!

- Emma.
- Whose side are you on?!

281
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,612
I'm not giving you Emma, because you
can't handle the responsibility of a child.

you don't want me to have the baby?

By the way, that fight
was totally arousing.

Dude, well done.

If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.

332
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,139
Yeah? Well, thanks.

So now do I get Joey?

334
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:40,483
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.

335
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,782
- Are you okay, Mon?
- Uh-huh.

336
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,660
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, it's just a plate.

337
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,581
- It's not like somebody died.
- It's all right. You can mourn.

338
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,919
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

339
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,298
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.

340
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,260
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

341
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,847
I don't care.

342
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:15,601
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

Look, Amy...

344

...we got a little...

345
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,821
...a little out-of-control over there.

346
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,989
And I'm sorry.

347
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,742
You're my sister...

348
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,328
...and if it really means
that much to you...

349
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,623
- So you're gonna give me the baby?
- No, I was...

350
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,876
I was gonna let you use
my Ralph Lauren discount.

351

- She needs changing.
- No, no, no. I'll get her.

354
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,975
I am super confident, totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.

355
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:00,521
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me
get my trusty diaper bag here.

356
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,155
Well, what do you know?
I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

357
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,253
- Does Monica know about her plates?
CHANDLER: Nope.

358
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,963
- Broke them all, huh?
- Yep.

359
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,007
- You gonna tell her?
- Nope.

360
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,679
Hey. So I'm gonna
put the plates back.

361
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,391
I think you're right. We shouldn't
use these plates for a long time.

362
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,103
- Like only if the queen comes?
- Maybe not even then.

363
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,689
Hey. I did it.

364
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,401
I told my producer I had a family
emergency. He totally bought it.

365
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,239
- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.
- No problem. Next week, stealing.

366
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,577
- Bye, plates.
- You told her you broke all the plates?

367
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,749
What?!
Something happened with the plates?

368
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:07,129
Yeah, this raccoon came in...
