Uh, look, Rach, I...

Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross.

- Hey, Joey.

- Hey, you.

You're weird today.

Listen, I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about something.

Yeah. Actually, uh, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

- Uh, Joey, could you give us a minute?
- No.

- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each.

Have, um, you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

Yay, that's so exciting. Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

42
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:37,341
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

43
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,594
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,808
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

- Sure.

That was you? I thought it was Jack.

No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

49
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,537
- What? Why does she think that?
- Because it kind of looked like I did.

Again, what?

with the ring in my hand...

As we all are at some point
during the day.

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,675
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket...

54
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,970
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

55
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,264
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

56
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,600
- I guess.
- And you did it first?

57
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,979
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

I know. I know. It's awful.

Well, what did she say?

60
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,278
She said yes.

61
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,531
Does Ross know?

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,659
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

63
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,370
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.
- Ooh, I like that. Yeah.

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,165
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

But you have to do it now before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

our chances of getting pregnant.

What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

82

Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

83

as the puppet master of the group.

- And you really think this is a good idea?
- I just talked him into it.

Don't tell me I have to do you too?

86
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,303
- The puppet master gets tired, people.
- Okay.

to be together. Everybody thinks so.

Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

152

- You didn't?

- So whose ring is it?

- Yes.

Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,506
But all I wanted to do was see...

to start things up again.

00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,982
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

167
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,528
...throw it on
and just start telling people?

168
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,656
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

169
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,244
Well, I didn't. I didn't propose.

170
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,372
Unless...

171
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,042
Did I?

172
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,882
I haven't slept in 40 hours and...

173
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,598
It does sound
like something I would do.

174
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,570
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

175
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,073
Ugh. It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

176
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,536
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees.

177
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,874
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

178
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,753
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

179
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,761
Hi, Dad.

180
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,892
- I can still call you that, right?
- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

181
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,063
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

182
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,402
- It wasn't fun?
- Why, why, why would you?

183
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,489
Look, I just don't want you to think...

184
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,325
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

185
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,202
Well, I don't think that.

186
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,206
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

187
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,000
It was a simpler time.

188
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,921
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

189
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,590
- What?
- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

190
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,967
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

191
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,553
Well, get back in there.
I'll guard the door.

192
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,598
Ha, ha. That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

193
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,353
Daddy.

195
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,146
You gotta get at it, princess.

196
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,440
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

197
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,193
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it.

198
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,903
That's how I got my bad hip.

199
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:47,116
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

200
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,912
This one time I had my knee
up on the sink, and your mother, she was...

201
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,166
Daddy, I don't think we need to hear about
the specific positions you and Mom had.

202
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,002
You're right.
This is about your positions.

203
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,798
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...

204
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,092
...for conceiving a child.

205
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,012
- Although it might feel good.
- I don't feel good right now.

206
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,100
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

207
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,603
You up to the task, sailor?

208
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,898
Seriously, sir, my brains,
all over the wall. Heh.

209
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,991
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

210
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,704
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

211
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,164
Joey asked me to marry him.

212
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,375
- What?
- Joey proposed to me.

213
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,963
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby.
- Well, I said yes.

214
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,924
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby.

215
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,263
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

216
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,182
It is bigger than mine.

217
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,729
I know. Days of our Lives,
thank you very much.

218
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,273
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

219
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,943
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

220
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,612
And he loves me so much.

221
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,071
Well, do you love him?

222
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,657
Sure.

223
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,538
- Sure?
- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

224
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,499
Honey, the question is...

225
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,376
...do you really want to marry Joey?

226
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,005
No.

227
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,008
No, I don't.

228
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,055
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

229
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,808
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

230
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,353
No. She had the ring on...

231
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,606
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

232
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,735
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on.
And what did it look like?

233
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,238
I didn't look at it.

234
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,116
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

235
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,828
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

236
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,457
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

237
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,459
I don't want to hurt her.

238
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,963
Okay, look, just do it gently.

239
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,340
You're right.

240
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,511
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

241
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,887
- I can do that.
- Okay.

242
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,932
I am a gentle person.

243
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,686
Oh, by the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

244
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,281
Hey.

245
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,910
Listen, I, um...

246
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,621
I heard about the engagement.

247
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,374
Surprised?

248
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,836
And confused.

250
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,384
Rach, sweetie, I, um...

251
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,345
I didn't propose to you.

252
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,557
I know.

253
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,728
I don't think you do.

254
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,066
You didn't propose to me.

255
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,317
Joey did.

256
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,196
Poor baby, you're so tired.

257
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:19,787
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

258
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,915
Joey didn't propose to you.

259
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,128
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

260
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,672
Uh...

261
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,508
You didn't propose to me.

262
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,762
Chandler didn't propose to me.

263
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,722
But Joey did.

264
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,892
Joey proposed to you?

265
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,395
- I can come back.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

266
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,107
- Joey, did you propose to her?
- No.

267
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,737
- Yes, you did.
- Actually, technically, I didn't.

268
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,407
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
- Wait.

269
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:02,997
- You gave her the ring?
- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

270
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,958
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

271
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,795
- You did, and don't you say you didn't.
- Ah.

272
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,714
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

273
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,717
- Whoa, you were down on one knee?
- Yeah, that looks bad.

274
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,430
But I didn't... I didn't propose.

275
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,350
- Then what did happen?
- Yeah, what did happen?

276
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,645
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up...

277
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,190
...and you thought I was proposing.

278
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,486
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

279
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,571
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

280
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,117
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

281
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,959
- Ugh! Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Well, I tried...

282
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,795
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

283
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,547
Whoa, hey.

284
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You saw her breast?

00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,305
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

286
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,060
Joey, then what the hell were you doing
with an engagement ring?

287
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,855
It wasn't my ring. It's Ross' ring.

288
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,693
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

No.

Well, this is awkward.

293
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:45,266
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

294
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:50,813
- But that... I mean, that was all, Rach.
- Dude, step up. I proposed.

No, you didn't.

I was gonna propose.

What...? What's that?

331
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,209
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

332
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,630
I'm sorry, what?

333
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,762
When you thought Joey proposed...

334
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,806
...did you say yes?

335
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:48,783
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

336
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,495
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

337
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,505
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

338
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,343
Thank you.
