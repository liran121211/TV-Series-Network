00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,296
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.

gonna take for you to forgive me?

337
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,751
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

338
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,797
- Did you get the grant?
- No. And you wanna know why?

339
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,342
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.

340
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,551
What?

341
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,096

because I wouldn't give you up.

I mean, he broke up with me.

343
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,895
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?

344
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,482
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:

345
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,526
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"

346
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,861
I'm sure he was just joking.

347
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,364
If you don't believe me,
let's go talk to him.

348
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,575
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
one paleontological question.

349
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,829
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:

350
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,164
Uh,
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"

351
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,876
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O...

you doing here?

with me, about the crazy questions you...

Wally Cox.
That's the voice of Underdog.

357
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,357
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...

358
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,611
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

359
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:07,658
No, don't do that. I want you to look
her in the eyes and tell her the truth.

360
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,952
Benji?

361
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,916
It's true. I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.

362
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,086
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.

363
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,881
Too little, too late, Benji.

364
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,136
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.

365
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:32,350
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?

366
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,143
No.

367
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,188
- Yes.
- What?

368
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,901
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...

369

...romantic.

370

Or?

371
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,202
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...

372
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,830
...but is there any chance
you would take me back?

373
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,293
Maybe.

374
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,589
Sweetie, this conversation is starting
to make me a little uncomfortable.

Oh, God. I am so sorry, but...

00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:14,016
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?

I'm sorry too.

378

- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.

Okay, that's it,
we are seeing other people.
