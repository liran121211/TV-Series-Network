1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,088
Hey, you guys.

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,673
PHOEBE: Hey.
- What are you doing?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,968
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
- We were doing the same thing.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,636
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,307
It's really crazy.
The hall, the dress, the food.

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,894
- I had no idea how expensive this stuff was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,606
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,693
It was simple. I came up with
some cost-cutting solutions...

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,863
...wrote out a list
and Monica told me to go to hell.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,657
There's no way around it.

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,577
Just accept that this is
gonna cost a lot of money.

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,205
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $40 billion-a-year industry.

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,375
Yeah. And I'm responsible
for just, like, half of that.

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,422
But really, it does seem like this money
could be put to better use.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,673
Are you serious?

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,177
Yeah. Now, how would you feel if we gave
all the wedding money to charity...

17
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,721
...and we just got married at City Hall?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,183
I think it would make me
wanna marry you even more.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,229
Well, I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,398
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,613
No, no, no. The next time's
gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

22
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,740
But maybe the time after that.

23
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,157
- Hey.
BOTH: Hey.

24
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,408
What's going on?

25
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,204
Our adoption social worker is coming by,
so we're cleaning the apartment.

26
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,081
"We"?

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,669
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.

28
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,923
Hey, is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?

29
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,468
- Kind of. She's coming to see where we live.
- And it has to go perfectly.

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,014
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.

31
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,393
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap-opera fan.

32
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,021
It's very impressive when
the little people know a celebrity.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,357
"Little people"?

34
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,317
"Celebrity."

35
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,487
So I think I'm just about done here.

36
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:40,367
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?

37
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,244
What?

38
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,123
- No.
- Chandler.

39
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,546
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.

40
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,340
So there's not a magazine
under the couch...

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,510
...or a pack of cigarettes
taped to the back of the toilet tank...

42
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,221
...or a filthy video in the VCR?

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,099
I'll admit to the cigarettes
and the magazine.

44
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,851
But that tape is not mine.

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,105
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,198
- May I help you?
- Yes.

47
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,618
We're here to make a rather
sizable donation to the children.

48
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,412
Well, any contribution,
large or small, is appreciated.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,707
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,336
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.

51
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,171
This is completely anonymous.

52
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,924
Completely anonymous.
From two kind strangers.

53
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,135
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.

54
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,180
We can put your names
in our newsletter.

55
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,266
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.

56
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,521
And X is spelled, uh, "Mike Hannigan."

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,359
All right, well, on behalf of the children,
thank you both very much.

58
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,863
- Sure. I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
- It does. It feels really good.

59
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,616
Oh, look.
And we get these free T-shirts.

60
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,036
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.

61
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,996
It's moist.

62
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,835
RACHEL: Emma will be up in a minute.
ROSS: Oh, good.

63
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,423
Oh, hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,803
Aw, that's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
other beautiful paleontologists out there.

65
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,764
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,142
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.

67
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,272
So, uh, what are you gonna do today?

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,899
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma
to the playground.

69
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,610
Oh, my God. What?

70
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,783
Like I said, I was thinking of taking
Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,041
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.

72
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,462
Because?

73
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,383
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...

74
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,178
...swing incident when I was little.

75
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,015
- Seriously?
- Yes. I was 4 years old.

76
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,017
And I was on the swing...

77
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:14,021
...and then all of a sudden my hair
got tangled in the chain.

78
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,777
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.

79
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,114
And it was uneven for weeks.

80
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,498
And you made it through that?

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,003
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.

82
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,175
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.

83
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,969
And I was thinking Claire Danes.

84
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,431
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your tragedy.

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,393
Okay? But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.

86
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,565
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

87
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,068
And there's that moment
when you're at the top...

88
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,072
...when you just don't know
if you're gonna return back to Earth.

89
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,618
Space is filled with orbiting children.

90
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,790
Look, please, just come on.

91
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,627
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.

92
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,756
- All right.
- Good.

93
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,383
You don't wanna be a mothers...

94
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,761
...who pass on their irrational fears
to their children, do you?

95
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,388
"Irrational," huh?

96
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,308
I'll remember that next time you freak
out about a spider in your apartment.

97
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,559
Oh, yeah, that's the same.

98
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,771
I'm sure there are 30 different species
of poisonous swings.

Okay. Okay. Here we go.

- Here we go.

Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?

106
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,085
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But, hey, I'm glad you're here.

107
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,796
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.

I don't know if you wanna use it, but...

109

Oh, this is so sweet of you.

110
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,223
Oh, but I won't be needing a veil.
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.

111
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,351
I told you, I am not coming
to a naked wedding.

No, no, no.
We're not having a big reception.

113
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,856
We took the wedding money
we were gonna spend...

114
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,899
...and donated it to a children's charity.

115
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,693
That's crazy!

116
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,991
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,494
Yeah, well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.

Oh, please. I put this on
and, ugh, I just look like...

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,752
Well, radiant.

121
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,009
All right, but who cares? You know,
I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.

122
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,178
That's right.
You're making a commitment.

- City Hall.

- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.

for the money back?
