too sophisticated for you?

00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,260
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

On every word?

Yep.

00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,520

All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

- Well, because you signed it:

sounding smart and just be yourself?

172
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,965
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

173
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,680
Ah, look who's back.

174
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,265
Why do you have bags?
Rach, why does she have bags?

175
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,351
I'm staying with you guys.

176
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,645
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

177
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,854
Come on.

178
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,865
- You slept out here?
RACHEL: Yeah.

179
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,412
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

180
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,125
But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

181
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,585
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

182
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,547
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

183
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,091
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

184
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,470
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

185
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,639
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

186
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,434
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

187
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,938
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

188
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,610
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

189
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:22,240
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

190
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,367
Yeah. Monica made us.

191
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,829
Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...

192
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,082
...because I don't think I would be
the person that I am today...

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,084
...if it wasn't for you guys.

194
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,837
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

195
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,299
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

196
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,969
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

197
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,306
Amy, that's what I
was supposed to wear today.

198
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,141
That's why I hung it on the door.

199
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,435
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

200
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,735
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

201
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,697
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

202
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,742
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

203
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,368
I am not happy.

204
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,749
Uh... Sure you want to eat that?

205
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,754
I'm curvy and I like it!

206
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,510
- Hi.
RACHEL: Hi.

207
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,346
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

208
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,681
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

209
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,187
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

210
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,900
- Seriously?
- Word.

211
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,487
Well, mine was worse than that.

212
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,864
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game...

213
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,784
...and this guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

214
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,662
- Oh, that is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

215
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,500
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

216
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,710
Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?

217
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,046
- Phoebe, that's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

218
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,298
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

219
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,884
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna propose...

220
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,886
...I don't think he's ever gonna ask again.

221
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,556
I mean, I said no in Barbados,
and now this?

222
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,559
She's right. If I were a guy and...

223
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,441
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

224
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,986
Maybe you don't need him
to propose to you.

225
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,571
Maybe you could propose to him.

226
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,491
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

227
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,869
I proposed to Chandler.

228
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,583
All right, moving on.

229
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,294
I don't think it was desperate.
I think it was amazing.

230
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,503
Thank you.

231
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,799
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

232
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,220
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

233
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,309
Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?

234
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,769
How about at a game on the big screen?

235
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,481
Huh! How about at a Foot Locker?

236
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,653
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

237
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,407
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

238
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,244
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

239
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,622
But what would a guy think?

240
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,668
- Uh, Nana's on the phone.
RACHEL: Wow.

241
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,505
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

242
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,758
She did?

243
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,135
Who got her condo in Boca?

244
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,763
Hello?

245
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,682
It's our nanny.

246
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,267
Hi.

247
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:41,147
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

248
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,066
That's Molly. She's sick.

249
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,361
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

250
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,530
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

251
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,532
Menstrual cramps.

252
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,828
I don't think that's what this is.

253
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,791
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,835
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

255
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,546
Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?

256
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,590
Well, I could do it.

257
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,219
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

258
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,553
Yeah.

259
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,807
Um, I do not want her
babysitting our child.

260
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,560
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

261
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,064
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

262
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,358
- What, the next one?
- Okay.

263
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,320
I don't want her watching our baby.

264
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,699
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

265
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,784
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

266
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,205
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

267
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,958
- You know, I don't know.
RACHEL: Ross, I'm telling you...

268
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,962
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

269
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,841
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

270
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:56,180
Uh, listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

271
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,685
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

272
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,063
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

273
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,318
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

274
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,738
So how much does it pay?

275
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,329
Hey, Joe. How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

276
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,833
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

277
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,920
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,089
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

279
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,050
No can do, amigo.

280
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,513
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

281
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,433
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

282
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,102
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

283
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,521
See you later.

284
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

285
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,402
We're never gonna get a kid.

286
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,780
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

287
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,283
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

288
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,202
It's okay. It's okay. You know what?

289
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,789
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

290
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,499
Okay, good.

291
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,834
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

292
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:11,297
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

293
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,343
Uh-huh.

294
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,595
Okay.

295
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,516
Thank you. Goodbye.

296
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,559
We're screwed, aren't we?

297
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,437
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

298
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,440
- They loved it.
- What?

299
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,694
They thought it was very smart of us to have
a child write the recommendation letter.

300
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,823
They thought Joey was a child?

301
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,034
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

302
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,706
AMY: Hi.
MONICA: What'd you guys do today?

303
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:51,003
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

304
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,590
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

305
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,300
Babies are dull.

306
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,931
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

307
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,602
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

308
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,856
- Ready?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,024
AMY:
Ta-da!

310
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,820
You pierced her ears?

311
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,865
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

312
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,789
RACHEL:
You pierced her ears?

313
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,375
How could you do this
without telling me?

314
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,254
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

315
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,173
I think she looks cute.

316
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,134
But I am wrong.

317
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,347
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

318
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,100
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

319
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,187
- Hey, guys.
CHANDLER: Ross!

320
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,274
Hi, Emma.
Oh. Why is she wearing her hat so low?

321
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,402
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

322
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,363
Why not?

323
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,200
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

324
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,745
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

325
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,998
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

326
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,792
Come here. Come here.

327
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,338
There she is. Hi.

328
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,051
- What?
- Nothing.

329
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,803
Hi.

330
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,890
What...?

331
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,899
[GASPS]

332
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,905
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

333
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,616
Did she do this to her?

334
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,244
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

335
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,371
RACHEL:
