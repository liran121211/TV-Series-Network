Monica tells Phoebe, who may not tell Chandler, that she met and lunched with Richard, but felt nothing. Monica decides to give Chandler one anniversary present a day early: tickets for Las Vegas; Phoebe insists everyone goes, to make up for her missing London. Ross and Rachel have previous engagements but decide to follow the next day. As Phoebe put the idea in her head, Rach tests out walking around alone and naked; Ross sees her and comes over, thinking it was a sexual invitation; this misunderstanding escalates on the plane to embarrassing each-other in outrageous ways. In Vegas, Joey must admit he's just earning cash while the movie is delayed lacking funds. Chandler and Monica fight whether she may see Richard again. Joey loses his only tip in one hand, but thinks he'll make a fortune because he found the dealer to be his 'identical hand twin', and demands Chandler is supportive this time.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Joey told the others he was doing a movie in Las Vegas but they didn't have enough money to shoot so Joey works at a casino dressed as a gladiator.
