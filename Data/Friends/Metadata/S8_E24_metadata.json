After Rachel decides that neither of the two names (Isabella and Delilah) that she and Ross had been choosing between seems to fit, Monica mentions that she has already chosen the names Daniel and Emma for her future children. Rachel is so taken with the name Emma that Monica happily consents to the baby having it. Janice comes to see Rachel, and says she admires her for her strength to raise the child on her own. When Rachel says she isn't alone because she has Ross, Janice tells her that Ross won't stay around forever and might meet someone else. Suddenly, Rachel feels very alone, and tries to talk to Ross about the kiss they had. Ross doesn't want to have a relationship with Rachel anymore, because if it doesn't work out it would really hurt their daughter, and he and Rachel are doing fine as things are now. Joey comes to comfort Rachel, and accidentally finds the engagement ring in Ross' jacket pocket. While he is kneeling to pick it up, Rachel thinks Joey is proposing to her - and although she is startled, she tearfully says yes.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583472", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 5337, "number_of_episodes": 235}
