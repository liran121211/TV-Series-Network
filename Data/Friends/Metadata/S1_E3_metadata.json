Chandler resumes his smoking habit. Phoebe is given $7000 when she finds a thumb in a can of soda.", "Monica is reluctant to introduce her new boyfriend, Alan, to her friends because they've mocked all of the boyfriend they've met before. To her surprise, they love Alan. However, she realizes she doesn't feel a spark with Alan and breaks up with him. Her friends take the news very hard, but Alan is relieved (since he couldn't stand her friends). Chandler resumes his smoking habit. Phoebe encounters a problem with her bank account, when a bank error in her favor nets her $1,000. She gives the money (and a complementary football phone) away to a homeless friend, who in turn buys her a soda. When Phoebe opens it, she sees a thumb, so the soda company gives her $7,000.\u2014Rachel"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583653", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 7993, "number_of_episodes": 235}
