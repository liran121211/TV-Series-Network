Ross tells Rachel that he only showed Jill fossil slides. Rachel makes him promise never to date her sister again - but when Jill finds out, she has a big row with Rachel and rushes straight to Ross, clearly planning something more this time. Joey, Monica and Phoebe are worried that Chandler can't cry about sad stories or even sad childhood memories, and call him dead inside. Phoebe is apparently outed as a porn star to Joey at Central Perk by her 'biggest fan' and by Gunther, who also knows about her sordid screen career. The friends rent a video of one of Phoebe's films, but Joey won't watch it - until Rachel notices that it's actually Phoebe's sister Ursula. Ross tells Rachel that he stopped Jill from kissing him, to keep from ruining any chance of a relationship with her - which finally makes Chandler cry.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583502", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 5091, "number_of_episodes": 235}
