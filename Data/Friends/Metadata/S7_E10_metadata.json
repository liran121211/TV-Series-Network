In order to entice Rachel to move back into their refurbished apartment, Phoebe must drive a wedge between Rachel and current roomie Joey.", "Phoebe brings in her late mother's Christmas memorial candy dish, shaped like a skull. Ben stays with Ross for the holidays who intends to teach his son about their Jewish heritage. He feels Ben is only exposed to Christmas traditions. Ross certainly makes his mark on Ben but the idea of a year without Santa sounds like a serious punishment. Chandler presumes that Rachel wants to stay living happily with Joey but Monica wants her to go back to Phebes so gives Joey drums to drive Rachel out. That doesn't work so they try a tarantula which scares Joey but not Rachel who had one as a kid.
