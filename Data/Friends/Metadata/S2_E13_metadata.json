Joey attempts to get a part in the movie. The girls only have eyes for human star Jean-Claude Van Damme; since Monica is too shy to address him, Rachel asks him, but he invites her- several rows and dates are the -even literally- messy result. Chandler meets a former classmate, Susie Moss, whom he once humiliated causing her to be nicknamed 'Susie underpants', but now makes him ask her out and wear her panties, alas not just for the kick...
