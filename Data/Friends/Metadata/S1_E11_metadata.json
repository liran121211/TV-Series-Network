Meanwhile, Monica and Phoebe fight over a guy in a coma.", "Chandler's popular, best-selling author mom, Nora Tyler Bing, announces on Jay Leno's show that her book tour's next stop is New York, and she gets the chance to see her son. Turning up in the Big Apple, she takes all the friends to a restaurant and encourages fan Rachel to try writing similarly cheap-steamy 'romantic formula' novels. She observes Ross' frustration about Rachel, assures him Paolo is not a hero that stays in the story to the end, unlike him, and somehow they kiss. Joey observes this and feels obliged to defend his mom Gloria's sex-appeal as equal, if you imagine her before producing seven children. Joey shames Ross into confessing the kiss to Chandler, who is irate and reads the riot act. Meanwhile Phoebe encouraged Monica to whistle to a hunk they saw walking on the street, which causes him to be hit by an ambulance and fall into a coma. They fantasize about him being the perfect boyfriend and compete to be the one to take care of him, hoping he'll wake up like a fairy tale prince.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Chandler's mom, lusty romance novelist Nora Bing, visits New York and takes everyone out to dinner.
