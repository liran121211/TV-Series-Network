Meanwhile, Joey is practicing for an audition to become the host of a new game show named \"Bamboozled\". Ross and Chandler invite Joey to play basketball, but he needs to practice for the casting and asks for some help.

Monica gets nervous, because Rachel's mother is still irritated about the last-minute invitation and brushes off Monica's apologies. Mrs. Green tells Rachel that she will move in with her for eight weeks when the baby comes, but Rachel doesn't like the idea and claims that she will be able to manage everything because has read some books. But when she opens her presents and sees all the strange items for a newborn, she freaks out and concludes that she indeed will need her mother's help.\u2014Alejandro Frias"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583573", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4655, "number_of_episodes": 235}
