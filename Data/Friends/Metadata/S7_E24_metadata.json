Meanwhile Rachel tries to hinder Monica.", "While Rachel uses ludicrous excuses to slow Monica down before she notices he is missing, Ross and Phoebe find still missing him in his office. He is afraid that becoming 'the Bings' will spell marital misery, maybe as bad as his parents. Ross gets him to face things one at a time and he feels better. Later smoking in the hall, Chandler overhears the girls about Monica's pregnancy test, and instead of freaking out he gets her a present and decides a baby isn't too scary. Internet-minister Joey has a hard timing leaving the film set, where famous co-star Richard is hopelessly drunk, but arrives just in time, still in World War I trench uniform, to officiate. Without either notes, decorum or a clue about the proper order of the ceremony he still manages to marry the happy couple. After the ceremony, Monica denies having taken a pregnancy test, Rachel seems to know more.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583532", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 6188, "number_of_episodes": 235}
