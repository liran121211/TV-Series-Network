Rachel accidentally deletes a message from Emily on Ross's answering machine.", "When Phoebe tells the friends that Gary took her along in a police patrol car, the boys insist to make a ride with him too - and get it that very night. Monica decides that's a perfect opportunity to catalog the photos most methodically, but one touch by Rachel undoes all her work; for comfort, she sends Rachel to Ross's place for margarita ingredients, but while there she overhears Emily on the answering machine express doubt about whether she and Ross were right to call off their marriage. Rachel is reluctant to erase the message as Monica insists, but accidentally pushes that button. She decides to wait for Ross and let him decide, but seeing he intends to call Emily, she stops him. Leave it to Joey to focus on 'the best sandwich in the world' that he picks up on the way, but isn't allowed to eat in the patrol car as it drips. When the boys confuse a car backfiring with a gunshot, Joey dives in front of Ross, leading Gary to call him heroic police material. Chandler is vexed, believing Joey cares more for Ross, but learns the truth: His buddy's primary instinct was to protect the sandwich.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583639", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4979, "number_of_episodes": 235}
