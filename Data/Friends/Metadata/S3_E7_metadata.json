Ross and Rachel have dinner with Rachel's father. Joey leads an acting class.", "Joey becomes a learning extension teacher in soap acting, and loves the respect from even more clueless kids. Monica chooses a ridiculously cheap bed from Janice's ex; Phoebe signs for her at delivery- of another bed, a childish race car! Rachel convinces Ross to dine with her dad, who takes him down even worse then he feared; the next day Ross and Dr. Green find each-other making fun about Rachel's chiropractor and various lack of good sense. When Joey hears one of his students also auditions for the same role he wants, he tries to eliminate him by bad advice to play the boxer gay, but the effect surprises him, though less then what he sees at the Mattress King when trying to get Monica's original bed.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0583637", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 5531, "number_of_episodes": 235}
