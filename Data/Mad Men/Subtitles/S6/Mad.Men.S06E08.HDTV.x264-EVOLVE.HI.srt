This is over,
and not just this.

3
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:07,557
You should get some sleep.

4
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:10,145
How can I?
My wife's a big TV star.

5
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:12,849
Why didn't you tell us
Frank Gleason was dying?

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,634
Frank's going to be fine.

7
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:15,971
I wanted to make it clear.

8
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,533
Unless this works,
I'm against it.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,249
Just saying the same thing.

10
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:24,833
So, how'd it go?

11
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:26,292
We went in together.

12
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:28,149
We won Chevy.

It's an easy thing
to say, isn't it?

35
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,100
You're not thinking.
You're not writing.

36
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:19,035
Ted, calm down.
You need a nap, too.

37
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,337

00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,871
Yes, I can.

Sorry I'm late.

You're sorry you're late?

00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:29,879
You couldn't call?

42
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,913
He called.
I told you there's no news.

43
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:33,349
You did not make that clear.

44
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:36,285
You really didn't.
You just said "no news."

45
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,220
You didn't say Kenny called in.

46
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,356
- Pow.
- Damn it.

47
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,358
No one cares
that I almost got killed?

48
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,659
What did they say?

49
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:47,262
It's just like last time, no.

50
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:49,830
- What does that mean?
- It means they didn't like it.

51
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:53,668
Then they got drunk, they took
me for a joyride in the Impala.

52
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:55,903
Why can't we have the Impala?

53
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,472
What did they say?

54
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:00,341
They said they didn't like 'em.

55
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,610
It's your job to make
them like them.

56
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,579
- Are you not up to the task?
- Don.

57
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:08,848
What? We've given them seven
ways to go in six weeks.

58
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,550
We don't even get
to talk to them?

59
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:13,052
We have to depend
on this cripple?

60
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:14,488
You don't know
what he's up against.

61
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:16,823
I've got to sit down,
but I'm not gonna

62
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:18,692
if you're just gonna
continue to insult me.

63
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:21,494
Just sit down.

64
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,228
( sighs ) They gave me this

65
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,863
and I can't even
show it to you.

66
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,932
What is it?
They typed up their rejection?

67
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,867
It's worse.

68
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,235
They finally gave me
a calendar.

69
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,371
Three years
of monthly deadlines.

70
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,640
That's the rest
of '68, '69, and '70.

71
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:37,875
Best case scenario, six months
of strategy statements,

72
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,811
every one of them
backed up with copy tests.

73
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,646
<i>And then, if and when</i>
<i>they land on something,</i>

74
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,648
it's got to kick its way up
the ladder through all of GM

75
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,216
until it gets to God.

76
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,118
And then He's got to
run it past His wife.

77
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,687
So what happens now?

78
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,822
You take a swing at it
and they take a swing at me.

79
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,089
They want another packet
Tuesday morning.

80
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,959
- But they want me back on Sunday.
- For what?

81
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,661
I guarantee you
they're not going to church.

82
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,930
We cannot go on like this.

83
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:01,932
This is what Chevy
is paying us for.

84
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,767
It's not our clock,
it's theirs.

85
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,436
So what's another weekend?

86
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,403
Because they're
really paying us.

87
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,206
Mr. Chaough,
you have a phone call.

88
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,574
Take a message.

89
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,210
It's Nan.
It's about that matter.

90
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:23,285
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,920
Get all the Chevy materials
back in my office.

92
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:28,590
- We're working the weekend.
- Yes, of course.

93
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,759
But I wanted to tell you
Dr. Rosen is on the phone.

94
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,996
- Do you want me to take a message?
- Yes.

95
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,199
- I'll find out what it's regarding.
- No.

96
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,701
I'll take it.

97
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,936
You know what, Don?
That's a great idea.

98
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm gonna call my doctor.
I'm gonna get Kenny here fixed up.

99
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,909
I'm gonna get
everybody fixed up.

Oh, bullshit.

He saw all the cigarette
butts out there

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,940
and he thinks
I'm smoking again.

113
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,509
I want to see you.

114
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,377
I was in the kitchen
biting my nails

115
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,312
thinking,
"I just cleaned it up."

116
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,280
How many nights
are you out there?

117
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:31,215
I know you want to see me, too.

118
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,050
All I kept thinking
is he's gonna come in

119
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,886
and ask my why
there's no lipstick on them

120
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,688
and I'm gonna burst into tears
and tell him everything.

121
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:40,090
Then he's gonna murder me
and murder you.

122
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,760
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

123
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm afraid of you.

124
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,130
I don't think you understand.

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,070
Look, I'm too old
to say this was a mistake,

126
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,372
but I want you to try
and be happy.

127
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,341

<i>That you got away with it.</i>

129

When you start
something like this,

130
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:05,047
it takes a lot of convincing.

131
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,850
It's all about whether
or not the other person

132
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,752
has as much to lose as you do,

133
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,688
because you want to be able
to trust them when it's over.

134
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:16,425
And right now I'm wondering
how I ever trusted you.

135

<i>I don't really have</i>
<i>a choice, do I,</i>

<i>because you've got me.</i>

137
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,532
So if you ever really cared
about me at all, knock it off.

Don't cry.
Just listen to me.

00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:04,983
I already did it.
You just have to get it.

176
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,551
- Go get it, Geenie.
- <i>( door closes )</i>

177
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,987
Go up there and get
Pinocchio and bring it down.

178
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,289
( sighs )
I have to do everything.

179
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:18,895
- Where's Daddy? We're ready to go.
- I'm taking you.

180
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,565
Were you sitting under the hair
dryer and just remembered that?

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,034
Where did you get that skirt?

182
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,469
I bought it.

183
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:27,238
You mean Megan
bought it for you.

184
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:29,639
- I earned it.
- On what street corner?

185
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,574
She pays me to babysit.

186
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:34,076
You're not a hired hand,
you're their sister.

187
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,078
Boys, let's go.

188
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:42,118
- <i>( knocks )</i>
- <i>( door opens )</i>

189
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,487
I'm sorry to bother you,

190
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,222
but Mr. Cutler
wants to see you.

191
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,925
It's been two and a half hours.

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,093
Do you want to rest some more?

193
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,962
No.

194
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:56,064
May I clean that up?

195
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,299
Please.

196
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,037
Put the Chevy materials
on the coffee table.

197
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,240
The funeral will be tomorrow.

198
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,609
Frank's family has asked
that in lieu of flowers

199
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:12,412
a donation be made to the
American Cancer Society.

200
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:17,151
Frank Gleason
was a great artist

201
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,786
and a great friend.

202
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:22,556
And he made our company whole.

203
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,325
I'm not gonna be able to work
with you through the weekend.

204
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,729
I apologize, but I'm afraid
this takes precedence.

205
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,498
I'll attend the funeral
if that's all right.

206
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,801
But I can still make myself
available for Chevy.

207
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,368
That's helpful.

208
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,171
I'm sorry for your loss.

209
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,007
He's a piece
that cannot be replaced.

210
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,850
The doctor's here
and I want you to see him.

211
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,986
- I don't know.
- No, he's gonna fix you up.

212
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,922
That's an order.

213
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,091
Can I see him, too?
I did it last time.

214
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,026
We're a team.
If he does it, I do it.

215
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,427
Age before beauty.

216
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,100
How old was he?

217
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,801
Older than you,
younger than me.

218
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,237
You either get used to it
or stop thinking about it.

219
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,039
Sorry about your friend.

220
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,841
Yeah, it's tragic.

221
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,110
I hope we don't lose
Ted for too long.

222
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,311
He doesn't know how
to deal with these things.

223
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,615
Do you feel anything?
'Cause I don't.

224
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,283
He said it takes a minute.

225
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,385
- Well, maybe I need another.
- I'm next.

226
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:33,388
Actually, Roger, I think
Don should go next. Don.

227
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,028
Pleasure to meet you.
Dr. Hecht.

228
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:41,997
Don Draper.
Where do you want me?

229
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,833
Anything in your medical history
you want to alert me to?

230
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,802
No, I'm just--

231
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,837
hell, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

232
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,973
You're exhausted.

233
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,741
I'll need you to turn
around and drop your pants.

234
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:55,709
- This goes in the gluteus.
- What is it?

235
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:58,012
It's an energy serum.

236
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,314
<i>Oh? What's in it?</i>

237
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,482
It's proprietary.
But all you need to know

238
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:05,185
is it's a complex
vitamin superdose.

239
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:08,789
It's basically my own combination
of B vitamins and a mild stimulant.

240
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:10,323
You have a heart condition?

241
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,659
No. I thought you said it was mild.
What does it do?

242
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:15,361
Well, a lot of things.
But I think it'll give you

243
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:16,830
what Jim Cutler says you need.

244
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,998
24 to 72 hours

245
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:21,834
of uninterrupted creative
focus, energy, and confidence.

246
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,136
- Really?
- Really.

247
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:25,771
No one told you about this?

248
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:30,843
I've visited
some agencies lately.

249
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:34,445
- You've got a great outfit here.
- Thank you.

250
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,081
All anybody wants to know is what
are you gonna call this place?

251
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,784
Can you tug your drawers
down a little?

252
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:46,557
"SCDPCGC"?
That's a mouthful.

253
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:01,504
- Stan again.
- ( laughs )

254
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,108
What do you say, Don?
You think you can beat me?

255
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:08,644
I want another chance.
You changed course.

256
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:11,180
- Who's next?
- That'd be me.

257
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:13,549
- And I have a heart condition.
- Don't worry about it.

258
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,685
( panting )

259
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,654
( laughs )

260
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,591
Come on, let's go.
Best two out of three.

261
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,361
( echoing ) You can beat me any day.
Let me see the doctor first.

262
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:27,762
<i>We'll do before and after.</i>

263
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:33,701
( coughing )

264
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,779
( coughing )

265
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:49,283
Hey, kid.
Where you going?

266
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,487
Come in here.

267
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:02,128
( coughing )

268
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:03,963
Sit down.

269
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,668
Breathe deep.

270
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,703
( inhales )

271
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,175
Is that you?

272
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:21,146
No.

273
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,149
It's a chest cold. I've
seen plenty of consumption.

274
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,417
You don't have it.

275
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:27,684
Lay down here.

276
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:34,491
Your mama don't know
how to take care of nobody.

277
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,360
She ain't my mother.

278
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,662
<i>( coughs )</i>

279
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,705
Can I help you?

280
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,607
Do we know each other?

281
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,676
I'd like to think so.

282
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,513
Can I help you?

283
00:14:56,548 --> 00:15:01,150
I meant from somewhere
other than from this moment.

284
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:03,820
I don't think so.

285
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,328
( loud clicking )

286
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:15,096
- <i>( men laughing )</i>
- <i>( phones ringing )</i>

287
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,398
<i>( ringing, laughing increases )</i>

288
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,903
<i>( silent )</i>

289
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,308
- Where's Ed?
- He said his heart stopped.

290
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,476
Roger took him to the hospital.

291
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,277
But they were both laughing.

292
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,247
The strategy is about some
kind of love transaction

293
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,814
between a parent and a child

294
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,317
involving the greatest
gift of all, a Chevy.

295
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:46,587
I was a child and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea.

296
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,555
Four score and seven years ago,

297
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,391
this country had some
memorable happenings.

298
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,028
What I don't understand is

299
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:56,763
is it "Dad, I want this car"

300
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:59,866
or "Son, I bought
you this car"?

301
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:03,169
Great, that's two. We need 15
more and we can try another.

302
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,171
In what family is it "Son,
I bought you this car"?

303
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:08,207
- Good night, all.
- That guy's family.

304
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,609
Did you hear about
Frank Gleason?

305
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,744
( laughs ) Yeah, I guess
dreams do come true.

306
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,679
I think that's in poor taste.

307
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,082
Tell him, Peggy. Tell him
what a son of a bitch he was.

308
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,784
I liked him.

309
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,286
Before he was sick?

310
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,554
I hate how dying makes
saints out of people.

311
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:25,656
Well, he's obviously
in a better place.

312
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,393
<i>Have a good weekend.</i>

313
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,327
"Dad, I need the car.
I've got a date."

314
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:33,130
"Dad, everybody at school
has a car but me."

315
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:35,799
"Dad, I can only go
to college if I have a car."

316
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,101
- "Dad, I--"
- "Dad, I could be dying in Vietnam.

317
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,602
Don't you want me
to have a car?"

318
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:41,471
Damn it, Ginsberg.
I had another 80 of them.

319
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,840
I got nothing interesting to
say 'cause I'm not on drugs?

320
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,874
No, you just flushed
a toilet in my head.

321
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,877
"Son, I got a car
when I was your age."

322
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:51,113
"Son, they didn't have
cars when I was your age."

323
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:54,683
"Son, you can fly till you're
high as an elephant's eye."

324
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,052
- ( Stan chuckles )
- That's great.

325
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:57,886
What are you, class secretary?

326
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:00,022
I want to write stuff down
so it looks like I'm working.

327
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,990
Fine.

328
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:04,492
The child is the father
of the man.

329
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,227
Spectacular.

330
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:21,208
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Dawn: <i>Mr. Draper.</i>

331
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>Mr. Cosgrove is here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

332
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,581
Hello, Kenny.
How you feeling?

333
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,649
My foot's like new.

334
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,718
You think you'll have
new work on Monday?

335
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,686
I'll have 15 campaigns
for you by then,

336
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,855
but you have to get me in a room
so I can look them in the eye.

337
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,858
The timbre of my voice
is as important as the content.

338
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,194
I don't know whether
I'll be forceful or submissive,

339
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,962
but I <i>must</i> be there
in the flesh.

340
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,231
You understand that I have
no power whatsoever?

341
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,500
That's not true.
Not if they like you.

342
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,868
- ( feet tapping )
- Oh, they like me all right.

343
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,969
( tapping )

344
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,338
- I'm their favorite toy.
- That's your job.

345
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,241
It's my job to take them to
dinner at 80 miles an hour.

346
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,910
It's my job to stop
a mile from the restaurant

347
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,879
so they can have
five pounds of crab legs

348
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,248
and three bottles of beer apiece
and then go get prime rib.

349
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,150
It's my job to go hunting so
they can fire off their guns

350
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,751
an inch from my ear and laugh

351
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,687
when I get startled
because <i>it's my job.</i>

352
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,289
Where'd you learn that?

353
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,093
My mother.
No, my first girlfriend.

354
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,930
( tapping )

355
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,769
One doesn't like changing
so often, you know?

356
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:30,073
- I don't know.
- I'm not myself, you see?

357
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,607
I don't see.

358
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:33,476
And she comes
to the fork in the road

359
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,513
then she says to the Cheshire
Cat, "Which road do I take?"

360
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,547
I know this.
Where do you want to go?

361
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,483
- I don't know.
- Then it doesn't matter, does it?

362
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,394
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

363
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,929
I know you're all feeling
the darkness here today.

364
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:57,131
But there's no reason
to give in.

365
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,601
No matter what you've heard, this
process will not take years.

366
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:03,804
In my heart I know
we cannot be defeated

367
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,474
because there is an answer
that will open the door.

368
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,077
There is a way
around this system.

369
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,312
This is a test of our patience

370
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,347
and commitment.

371
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:17,850
One great idea
can win someone over.

372
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,353
Dear Lord, you're as
good as they say.

373
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,190
That was very inspiring.

374
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,024
Do you have any idea
what the idea is?

375
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,060
No.

376
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:29,895
But I'm not gonna stop looking.

377
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,298
( sighs ) I think we
should order dinner.

378
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:34,233
I don't think
I'll ever eat again.

379
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,168
Do what you have to.

380
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:41,139
<i>( coughing )</i>

381
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:49,647
- You're burning up.
- ( sniffles )

382
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,949
You have to eat something.
Sit up.

383
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,385
I can't, Miss Swenson.

384
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,754
Call me Aimée,
and yes, you can.

385
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,903
( coughing )

386
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,254
I've got it.

387
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,491
I've got it.

388
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,760
How many times do you do it?

389
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,095
I need six throws
for a reading.

390
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,930
What are you doing?

391
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,366
The I Ching.

392
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,534
Have you slept?

393
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:49,637
Crap, I missed
the funeral, didn't I?

394
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:52,506
- How was it?
- It was rough.

395
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,175
It was beautiful.

396
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,877
Who are you?

397
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:59,246
Her name is Wendy.
Wendy, this is Don.

398
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,215
Don. Ask a question.

399
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:04,468
- I'm supposed to be next.
- Are you done with mine?

400
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:07,753
You can just think of it.
You don't have to say it out loud.

401
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:12,358
Perfect.

402
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,413
Peggy, do you remember
when we had soup?

403
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,697
( chuckles ) Maybe.

404
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,499
Could you be more specific?

405
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,767
Carnegie Deli has great soup.

406
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:24,769
No, he's talking
about some account.

407
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:26,971
He asked me yesterday.
I don't think it exists.

408
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,274
- No, I didn't.
- I don't understand what you're asking.

409
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,510
We had an account at Sterling Cooper.
A soup account.

410
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:33,344
That must have been
before my time.

411
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,012
Can you go to the
archives and look for it?

412
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:37,315
I already looked.
Why are you asking her?

413
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,317
- 'Cause you think I'm incompetent?
- I did it!

414
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:42,086
I've got 666 ideas.

415
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,455
I'm wasting my Saturday
with lunatics.

416
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:46,790
- It's Saturday?
- Yes, it is.

417
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,693
Why don't you lay down
for a little while?

418
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,328
Because I've got it. I want
you to go to the archives.

419
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:55,632
Look in 1958 or '59 for soup.

420
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,468
You'll know it when you see it

421
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:00,470
and it's gonna crack
this thing wide open.

422
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,907
You see the mess you made?

423
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:22,056
Wendy:
<i>That was fast.</i>

424
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,059
What are you doing in here?

425
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,329
You said you were
going to get some ice

426
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:31,065
and we were going to have a
drink and watch the sun set.

427
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,167
I have some things to do.

428
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,371
Stop doing that.

429
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:40,674
( chuckles ) You are really
uptight, aren't you?

430
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,709
No, I'm just on a deadline.

431
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:46,980
Where'd you get that?

432
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,916
It was upstairs
in one of the offices.

433
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,721
You want to get it on?

434
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:57,189
Wendy, what are you doing here?

435
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,558
I'm here to make you
feel better.

436
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:03,095
I feel great,
but I'm on a deadline.

437
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:05,964
"Does someone love me?"

438
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,767
What?

439
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,801
That's what your question was.

440
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,370
Why would you say that?

441
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:14,572
That's everyone's question.

442
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:19,277
I want to hear your heart.

443
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,684
Oh.

444
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:28,786
I think it's broken.

445
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,487
You can hear that?

446
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,189
I can't hear anything.

447
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:34,792
I think it's broken.

448
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:40,397
You should go.

449
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,799
I'm in the middle of something.

455

- Draper's.
- Sally?

456
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:04,986
- When are you coming home?
- Is Megan there?

457
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,856
- I want to talk to him.
- It's my dad.

458
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:13,094
Where are you?

459
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:14,762
I'm still at work.

460
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:17,431
I have to leave.
I'm leaving right now.

461
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:20,701
I'm really sorry.
I'm not finished yet.

462
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,036
It-- I'm really close.

463
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,605
It's just the research
hasn't come in.

464
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,575
Don, I don't care.
What am I supposed to do?

465
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,009
I watched them last night
so you could work and now--

466
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,878
I'll be home in a little bit.

467
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:34,647
Well, I don't like
you working so hard.

468
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,982
You must be exhausted.

469
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,317
Actually, I've got
a second wind.

00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,190
When's he coming home?

471
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:47,158
Sally, how would you like to earn
some boots to go with that skirt?

472
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:49,862
You're going to leave us
with her <i>again?</i>

473
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,330
I'm really sorry, sweetie,
but you know you'll have fun.

474
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,065
Don't make her feel bad.

475
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,434
Where are you going?

476
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:57,436
I'm going to see a play.

477
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,671
And Jeff my agent is going to
introduce me to some producers

478
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,072
so that maybe I can
be in their play.

479
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,973
Why do you want to do a play?

480
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,510
You're on TV every day.
Don't they know that?

481
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:08,279
Shit, you must be hungry.

482
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:10,247
Sally, would you put
a pot of water on the stove?

483
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:11,616
I'm gonna make
spaghetti in a minute.

484
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,083
I'm gonna wait for Dad.

485
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:14,685
We're not hungry.

<i>a peanut butter and jelly.</i>

488
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:22,091
Step right up.

00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:23,960
How about everybody takes one?

490
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:25,529
Do a real firing squad.

just like Saint Sebastian.

Hold on a second.
One at a time.

493

Everybody'll get a chance.

494
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:31,868
You're pretentious,
you know that?

495
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:33,202
I love that.

496
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:34,269
I'm gonna do it.

497
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:35,404
Fine, but I'm gonna go first

498
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,705
because you're drunk.

499
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,707
In fact, I believe
I'm the only person

500
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,709
in the Time-Life Building
who's not out of his mind.

501
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:42,711
But you hate him.

502
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,346
I hate apples more.

503
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:47,082
Don't hit his eye.

504
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:48,617
Don't hit anything.

- Aw, crap.
- Who's next?

00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,793
It's fine. It's fine.
I've done that before.

508
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:03,331

You're lucky
I don't like beards.

533
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,105
Women say that, but
they don't act like it.

534
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,873
You're like my brother.

535
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:26,275
You don't have a brother.

536
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,612
I want you to stop.

537
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,815
No, you don't.

538
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,919
I have a boyfriend.

539
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:54,736
No.

540
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:58,906
( sighs ) Come on.

541
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,408
I need this.

542
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:02,276
I know, I know.
You're in pain.

543
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,044
( sighs )

544
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:06,346
My cousin Robbie
was killed in action.

545
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:10,183
20 years old.

546
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:15,622
Had to join the fucking Navy.

547
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,924
That's awful.

548
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,400
What happened?

549
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,671
They don't tell you.

550
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,907
They just tell you
when it happened.

551
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:38,043
March 4th.
Three months ago.

552
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,378
( sighs )

553
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:45,683
That means my aunt sent
16 letters that he never saw.

554
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,055
You know they get mail
right up to the front lines?

555
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:55,560
That'd be a bad job, right?

556
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:57,795
Delivering mail into combat?

557
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,732
I'm so, so sorry to hear that.

558
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,781
I've had loss in my life.

559
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:23,619
You have to let
yourself feel it.

560
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:27,055
You can't dampen it
with drugs and sex.

561
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,593
It won't get you through.

562
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:33,027
Maybe we're different.

563
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:37,699
Why don't you go home?

564
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,902
( laughs ) 'Cause I can't
stand up right now.

565
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:43,972
That's from the shot.

566
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:48,008
You've got a great ass.

567
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,546
Thank you.

570
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:19,739
You startled me.

571
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:22,107
I didn't know anybody was home.

572
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:23,509
What are you doing?

573
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:25,244
Go back to sleep.

What are you doing here?

575
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:30,149
I'm visiting.
Didn't nobody tell you?

576
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:32,984
No.
Who are you?

577
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,454
I'm your grandma.

578
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,321
That's impossible.

579
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:39,390
Now, why is that impossible?

580
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,294
Okay, I know.

581
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,463
But I raised your daddy.

582
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:48,232
What are you doing here?

583
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:51,235
I was just looking
for a serving plate.

584
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,437
I was gonna make
your daddy's favorite.

585
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,038
You know, he loves
fried chicken.

586
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:56,973
I bet you do, too.

587
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,476
Ooh, you sure look like him.

588
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,344
No one said you were coming.

589
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:04,381
Well, I think I was supposed
to be a surprise for you.

590
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,916
And your daddy
said I could visit

591
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:08,551
and he gave me a key.

592
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:10,953
I thought nobody was home.

593
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,889
Come over here and give a hug

594
00:31:13,923 --> 00:31:15,558
to your Grandma Ida.

595
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:21,530
Now don't you be rude to me.

596
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,433
Is that how you was raised
to speak to your betters?

597
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,970
No.

598
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,439
I'm gonna fix you some eggs.

599
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,209
And you're gonna sit down
and you're gonna eat 'em.

600
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:38,046
But first, you're gonna tell
me who else in the house.

601
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,181
How come you don't know?

602
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:43,117
I haven't talked to your daddy
in a long time.

603
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,519
And he want
to surprise me, too.

604
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,321
I've never heard of you.

605
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:51,592
Your daddy Mr. Donald
Draper or not?

606
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,563
You come over here
and give me some sugar.

607

Now I know you ain't
here all by yourself.

608
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,178
My little brothers are here.

609
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:15,580
Well, there's no need
to wake them.

610
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,215
Just be us.

611
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,817
Okay, let's go
and make you some eggs.

612
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:22,053
I bet you like them scrambled.

613
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,554
I can make them.

614
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,957
And burn yourself on the stove?

615
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:29,160
When you think
they're gonna be home?

616
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,628
I don't know.

617
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,066
When's the last time
you saw my dad?

618
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,367
Years ago.

619
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:39,836
I doubt he's changed.
He still handsome?

00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:41,437
Yes.

00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:43,090
Now why'd you do
something like that?

697
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:49,297
You hurt my feelings.

698
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:51,966
I'm gonna go out
and get some air.

699
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,102
When I come back,
you best be sleeping.

700
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,347

701
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,786

702
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:16,055

"This may be hard to believe,

705
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,407
but the history
can't be ignored.

706
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:39,310
The history should <i>not</i>
be ignored.

707
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:41,979
Look, I don't want to waste
your time, with..."

708
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:45,449
Peggy!

709
00:37:52,423 --> 00:37:54,591
"I don't want you
to shut this door.

710
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:57,693
Just let me say a few things.

711
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:59,061
You and I both know--"

712
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:00,262
Did you want us?

713
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:02,031
Yes.
Get everyone.

714
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:03,899
No, wait.

715
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,401
Just listen.
I've got it.

716
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:07,503
Great.

717
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,476
Remember this work?

718
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,211
I've never seen it before.

719
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:19,047
Well, it says it all.
It really does.

720
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:23,317
Okay, I've got
this great message

721
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,453
and it has to do with what
holds people together.

722
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,522
What is that thing
that draws them?

723
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,590
It's a history.

724
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,527
And it may not even be
with that person, but it's...

725
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,163
it's like a...

726
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:38,698
well, it's bigger than that.

727
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,767
And that makes them buy a car?

728
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:44,604
If this strategy is successful,
it's way bigger than a car.

729
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,507
It's everything.

730
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,777
I keep thinking about the basic
principle of advertising.

731
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,445
There's entertainment
and you stick the ad

732
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,379
in the middle of the entertainment
like a little respite.

733
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,848
It's a bargain.

734
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:57,349
They're getting
the entertainment for free.

735
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:58,851
All they have to do
is listen to the message.

736
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:01,520
But what if they don't
take the bargain at all?

737
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:03,388
What if they're suddenly
bored of the entertainment?

738
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,457
What if they don't--
what if they turn off the TV?

739
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:07,726
- You gotta get your foot in the door.
- Exactly!

740
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:10,361
So, how do I do that?

741
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,896
Let's say I get her
face to face.

742
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,798
How do I capture
her imagination?

743
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:15,800
I have a sentence, maybe two.

744
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,735
Who's "her"?

745
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,138
Promise them everything. You know,
you're gonna change their life.

746
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:23,374
- <i>You're gonna take away their pain.</i>
- That's good.

747
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:25,175
Then you hit 'em
with the one-two punch.

748
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,010
What's the answer
to all of life's problems?

749
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,078
A Chevy.

750
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,980
No, it's not.

751
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:31,481
Then it's oatmeal?

752
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,483
No.

753
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:36,653
What have you been doing
the last three days?

754
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:39,122
Have you been working
on Chevy at all?

755
00:39:39,156 --> 00:39:40,991
I gotta go.

756
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,493
You wanna get someone
in here who can draw?

757
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:45,128
No, I don't have time for art.

758
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:53,269
He's happy.
Now we can relax.

759
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:57,039
You think he'll care
if I nap in here?

760
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:59,141
Don? Wait.

761
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,554
( moaning )

762
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,700
I'm going home!

763
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,380
Okay, I'm gonna
change my shirt,

764
00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:36,515
tell Megan I'm going out
for cigarettes,

765
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,351
then I'm gonna knock
on her door.

766
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:41,854
Sylvia, don't close
the door on me.

767
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:44,190
( sighs )

768
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,592
"When in the course
of human events--" no.

769
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:49,628
"You haven't heard
everything I have to say."

770
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,630
Don't shut the door on me.

771
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:56,367
All right, all right,
he's home.

772
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:58,436
Oh, thank God you're here.

773
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,506
What's going on?

774
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,273
I'll tell you what's going on.

775
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:05,643
Some elderly Negro woman
held your children hostage

776
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:06,877
and robbed you blind.

777
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:09,379
- What?
- Betty.

778
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,048
She robbed a bunch
of places in the building

779
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,149
and she came in here.

780
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,584
Our back door was open.

781
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,954
She said she was your mother.

782
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,323
We think we caught her
boarding the IRT.

783
00:41:20,357 --> 00:41:22,291
You'll need to come down
in the next 24 hours

784
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,392
and ID your things.

785
00:41:23,427 --> 00:41:25,328
Because no one was here.

786
00:41:25,362 --> 00:41:27,831
Because she's off on the
casting couch and you're--

787
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,766
what does he tell everybody,
that he's at work?

788
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,568
This is not the time or the
place for this conversation.

789
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:34,569
Ma'am, this could have
happened to anyone.

790
00:41:34,604 --> 00:41:36,639
Anyone who lives
in this disgusting city

791
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:38,473
and leaves their
three children alone.

792
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,709
Do you know Henry's
running for office?

793
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,912
Sally, I'm really sorry.

794
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:44,980
I should have been
home earlier.

795
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:46,815
I want to go home.

796
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:50,752
( sighs )

797
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:53,521
Miss Swenson: You get your hands off me!
I don't need to be manhandled!

798
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,089
Mack: <i>I know you've
been holding out on me.</i>

799
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:57,091
You don't know anything.
I defy your accusations.

800
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,993
You peddle that ass
on the street.

801
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:01,029
<i>You don't deserve a home.</i>
<i>You don't deserve me.</i>

802
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:03,131
Yeah? I do fine
without you.

803
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:04,866
- And you owe me money, not the
other way around. - Get out.

804
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,166
'Cause I took
that boy's cherry.

805
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,035
<i>$5, we'll call it even.</i>

806
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:11,437
Is that true?

807
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,473
No.

808
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:15,308
You filthy, shameful,

809
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:19,179
disgusting, shameful,
horrible...

810
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:20,947
You're trash!

811
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:22,614
You are filth!

812
00:42:22,649 --> 00:42:24,150
You know that you are!

813
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:26,786
After I gave you a home,

814
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,722
you go and do something
this disgraceful!

815
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:56,246
I know you're exhausted, but I could
feel the floor swimming, too,

816
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,981
when I came home to that.

817
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:00,350
I'm surprised
we didn't all faint.

818
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,421
( sighs )

819
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,257
I'm really sorry.

820
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:11,094
Sally seems so grown up,
but she's really still a kid.

You should talk to him.

828

Hello?

829
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,439
I just wanted to call
and tell you I'm okay.

830
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:37,407
I didn't have a heart attack.

831
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,009
I've just been working
too much.

832
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,647
I'm-- I'm so embarrassed.

833
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,883
I acted like
a stupid little kid.

834
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,919
No, you didn't.

835
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,087
And I'm sure she's fooled
plenty of adults, too.

836
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,023
She said she knew you.

837
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,657
I asked her everything I know

838
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,927
and she had an answer
for everything.

839
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,830
Then I realized I don't know
anything about you.

840
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,469
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Dawn: <i>Mr. Chaough wants to see you.</i>

841
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:11,306
You did everything right.

842
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,808
Try and forget about it.

843
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:14,509
Okay.

844
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,578
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Sally.

845
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:21,350
I left the door open.

846
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:23,284
It was my fault.

847
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:28,656
Okay. Bye.

Morning, fellas.

I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

853
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:47,874
How could you bring
Frank's little girl here?

854
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:49,709
I let her tag along.

855
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:51,043
I kept an eye on her,
didn't I, Don?

856
00:45:51,078 --> 00:45:52,311
Who?

857
00:45:52,346 --> 00:45:54,213
Wendy.

858
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:56,148
Believe me, it's a lot better
than what could have happened

859
00:45:56,183 --> 00:45:58,149
if I had let her loose in the
Village like she wanted.

860
00:45:58,184 --> 00:46:00,352
Well, that's not
what her mother thinks.

861
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:02,053
What the hell went on
here this weekend?

862
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:03,555
Half of this work is gibberish.

"Chevy" is spelled wrong.

864
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:07,259
Look, I am going
to continue on Chevy

865
00:46:07,293 --> 00:46:09,094
in my function
as creative director.

866
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:11,263
That is, evaluating
other people's work.

867
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:13,098
That's all I can do right now.

868
