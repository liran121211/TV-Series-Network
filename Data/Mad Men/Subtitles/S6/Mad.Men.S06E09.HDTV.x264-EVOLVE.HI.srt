<i>You're going to

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,561
And between you, me and
soon a national audience,

4
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,359
it's more of a love affair.

5
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,446
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,092
I don't want to live on
the Upper East Side.

7
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:14,082
Why?

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,298
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,944
We created a human life.

10
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,498
When you told me
about the merger,

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,667
I hoped he would
rub off on you.

12
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,667
Obviously, you're on his side.

13
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,954
Why did you do it all
off their sides?

16
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:10,304
It tastes better
because it's more expensive.

17
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,539
It's the premium brand
and it's priced accordingly.

18
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,441
Price is irrelevant
because the question is

19
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:16,510
does it taste
better than butter?

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,847
Butter is actually fresh.
Margarine is indestructible.

21
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,750
He's right because he's only
comparing different margarines

22
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,719
and margarine has a 70%
market share over butter.

23
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,821
But it's hard to say
any brand is luxury

24
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,823
<i>when although Fleischmann's</i>
<i>is the most expensive</i>

25
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,592
and Blue Bonnet,
owned by the same company,

26
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,160
is the least expensive,
the difference is only pennies.

27
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,397
45 cents a pound
is the highest.

28
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,533
29 is the lowest.
That's 50% more expensive.

29
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,134
Fleischmann's is Chivas Regal.

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,035
Still half the price of butter.

31
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,371
- It's Budweiser.
- But what's the market share?

32
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,072
I just said it's much
higher than butter.

33
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,041
Seeing as I have
the ear of the client,

34
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:54,012
it's my recommendation
we go on taste alone.

35
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,313
Peggy!

36
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,517
Don, I agree with you.

37
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,523
You're in the market
buying margarine.

38
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,525
Okay.

39
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,160
What goes through your mind?

40
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:13,263
Mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste?

41
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:17,400
Or mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste and price?

42
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,969
I'd buy the cheaper one.

43
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,906
There's one for 45 cents
a pound and one for 29.

44
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,341
Which one do you think
is gonna taste better?

45
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,445
It's a terrible gamble to tell a client
that their product is expensive.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,880
Shh.
Let her answer.

47
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,984
I don't know.

48
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,486
They both sound good.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,821
Really?

50
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,522
Does everyone agree with yours?

51
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:42,424
It's not his and mine.
Everyone has an opinion.

52
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,892
We haven't heard it,
but I'm sure they do.

53
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:45,293
I like Don's.

54
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,095
What did Harry say?

55
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,264
I feel strongly both ways.

56
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,668
They're both so good.

57
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:56,637
I'd probably ask someone to run
them by the client on the sly.

58
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:58,272
The meeting's tomorrow.

59
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:04,511
You know what, Don?
Let's go with yours.

60
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,981
Nah, I'm not even
gonna be there.

61
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:12,151
You should go with whatever
you're most comfortable with.

62
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,096
Could you get me another
copy of that research?

63
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,965
I want to make it big
on a board.

64
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,704
Did you see that?
He didn't even turn around.

65
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:33,939
- Yep.
- Oh, it speaks.

Come on, I wasn't gonna
get in the middle of that.

67

You suddenly dumber than Peggy?

68
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,243
So you're content in silence?

69
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,112
I'm content with reality.

70
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,014
You know what this place looks
like to the outside world?

71
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,082
A mess. We don't
even have a name.

72
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,685
- We're the '27 Yankees.
- Says who?

73
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,655
Pete, you want to get
your balls tickled?

Go see a headhunter.

75

Are you leaving?

76
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,259
Look, when things settle down,
I'm gonna be a partner.

77

how do you say, a pen
to write something down.

Oh, well, the desk
is littered with them.

84
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:27,022

00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:28,857
Certainly, Colette.

Although this is
my husband's office.

87
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,126
I should be offering you one.

88
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,862
It is no trouble at all.

We're both interested

I will.

110
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,487
I'll look at it very carefully

111
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,456
and then I'll formulate
an educated opinion.

112
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,792
You should try it sometime.

You've been debating
that for weeks.

- I'm not paying you to be a diplomat.

Your opinion matters.

Now what do you think
is the best way to go?

120
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,708
- It's somewhere in the middle.
- No, Peggy.

00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:00,809
There's a right
and there's a wrong.

122
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,544
How could that be?

00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,347
What you're really saying is
there's you and there's him.

And I don't know how I became in charge
of turning this into a collaboration.

Isn't that your job?

00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,521
You're both demanding
and you're both pigheaded.

You're the same person

he's interested in the idea

and you're interested
in your idea.

He's interested in his idea.
Don't let him fool you.

- What?
- Hey, I don't want to worry her, man.

I'm sorry, but I'm trying

- Jesus, what happened?
- Are we done here?

00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:42,161
Can you believe
those questions?

174
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:45,164
- Fascist pig!
- Shut up, Abe!

175
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,631
You don't know
what they look like?

176
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,100
You have a photographic memory.

177
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,734
Peg, I'm not gonna
give him an excuse

178
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,503
to shake down every kid that
walks through this neighborhood.

179
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,238
What about the one
that stabbed you?

180
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,007
This is a fucking police state

181
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,707
and we're gonna
have to fight, okay?

182
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,375
They did it in Prague.
They did it in Paris.

183
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,044
And, believe it or not, we're
gonna have to do it here, too.

184
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,180
That doesn't mean
protecting criminals.

185
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,850
Listen, baby, it's my right to
tell whomever whatever I want.

186
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,086
But you can keep talking because
everything you say is going in my story.

187
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,654
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,756
It's just fascinating,
the attitudes I'm encountering.

189
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,092
But why would you side
with the cops?

190
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,094
I don't know.

191
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,968
( sighs ) I read about this.

192
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,040
You obviously had
a traumatic experience

193
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,842
not unlike combat.

194
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:37,213
So I'm going to let you do
whatever you're doing.

195
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,448
Don't patronize me.

196
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:42,284
Those kids have no other
recourse in this system.

197
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:44,585
- They're animals.
- They were brought here by slave ships.

198
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,254
Well, I was
brought here by you.

199
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,723
I don't care if I take a loss,
I'm gonna sell this shithole.

200
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:52,327
You're worried about me
and I love you for it.

201
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,830
Now, I don't think
I can type with this thing.

202
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,732
Get my Olympia. Help me
get some of this down.

203
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,701
I'm going to bed.

204
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,211
This is nice.

205
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:15,414
It's Thursday.
Told you I was making dinner.

206
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,586
Sit down.

207
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,457
How was your day?

208
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,226
How was yours?

209
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,961
Hmm.

210
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,296
It was...

211
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,365
Ugh, it was terrible.

212
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,566
I don't even know
if I want to talk about it.

213
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,237
What's for dinner?

214
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,872
I think they hate me.

215
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,740
They just gave you
a second part.

216
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,443
I feel like an idiot
because they keep telling me

217
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,278
they can't tell
the twins apart.

218
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,980
I think I'm playing them
very differently.

219
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,883
It's not like
it's never been done before.

220
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,584
Exactly.

221
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,854
I told Mel I didn't want
to be a cliché.

222
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,124
Then he starts rapping about how
they're two halves of the same person

223
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:04,761
and they want the same thing, but they're
trying to get it in different ways.

224
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,597
<i>( sirens blaring )</i>

225
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,971
( sighs )

226
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:19,241
Listen, would you mind if we
just go in and turn on the set?

227
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,776
I'm really not hungry.

228
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,678
Did you have a bad day?

229
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,148
I'm just tired.

230
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,852
Go lay down.
I'll clean up.

231
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:35,557
I already packed your bag
for Bobby's camp.

232
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,561
Tomorrow's another day.

233
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,903
John, could you give us
some privacy?

234
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:53,340
<i>( divider closes )</i>

235
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,810
Was the evening a success?

236
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,445
You tell me.

237
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:03,549
Well, I--

238
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,185
I found it fascinating as usual

239
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,821
watching you work your magic.

240
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,056
And while you were watching me,

241
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,259
everyone was watching you,
weren't they?

242
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,802
Stewart did everything
but grab your ass.

243
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,540
I didn't notice.

244
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:30,542
What did he say to you?

245
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,477
( sighs )

246
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,946
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble.

247
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,948
Word for word.

248
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,488
He said he wanted
to be alone with me.

249
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,293
What else?

250
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,294
All night.

251
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,107
Daddy, I don't want him
running on the steps.

252
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,108
Why not?
Kids are supposed to run.

253
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:09,711
Ellery, come down.

254
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,479
We don't have any steps
in the apartment.

255
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,848
He's not good at them.

256
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:17,886
So what do you think, girls?

257
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,621
See any resemblance?

258
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:21,657
He's very handsome.

259
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:23,658
So, Ellery, take a good look.

260
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,627
- Who's your type?
- ( giggles )

261
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,462
Hello, Margaret.

262
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,130
I'll tell you mine later.

263
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,066
It's nice to see you.

264
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,902
Oh, he's precious.
How old is he?

265
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:38,305
He's four. He's having a
special day with Pop-pop.

266
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,406
We're going to the zoo
and maybe the movies.

267
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:41,975
So it's just a regular workday.

268
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,610
( laughs )

269
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:45,511
Don't fill him full of junk.

270
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,547
Can't promise that.

271
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,417
Wave good-bye, swabby.

272
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,752
We're shoving off.

273
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:58,190
How many times
have you met with Harry?

274
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,726
Too many. Don't waste
my time like Crane.

275
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,962
I'm a headhunter,
not a fan club.

276
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,664
Fine, let's talk about me.

277
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,733
Let's talk about Burt Peterson.

278
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,902
I got him a vice
presidency at McCann.

279
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,903
If he keeps his head down,
he's set for life.

280
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:16,373
But the merger was fresh.
I don't know your situation.

281
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:18,009
You weren't very straight
on the phone.

282
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,644
You think they're gonna
cut you loose?

283
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,513
How come you didn't
get yourself a job?

284
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,917
( chuckles )
That's a Yankee wrinkle.

285
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:28,752
- You interested in my business?
- No.

286
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,789
Well, if we sat down
a couple of months ago,

287
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,758
this would have been
a different conversation.

288
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,627
Nothing's changed.
I'll show you my Rolodex.

289
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,896
It's not that. It's your lack of a
role in the management structure.

290
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,065
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
Cutler Gleason and Chaough?

291
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Who the hell's in charge?

292
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,535
Two of those men
are as dead as doornails.

293
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,938
There's still a lot of chiefs
and only a couple of Indians.

294
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,973
And a lot of questions.

295
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,808
What the hell
happened with Vicks?

296
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,712
So...

297
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:58,447
paint me a new portrait.

298
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,882
I'm glad you said that.

299
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,284
How about seeing things
from the client side?

300
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,187
There's a head of marketing job in
Wichita that you'd be perfect for.

301
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,756
Anything back here on Earth?

302
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,791
( laughs ) You know,

303
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,259
I've always liked you,
Campbell,

304
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,028
so forgive me for saying this,

305
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,329
but if you do a little better,
I can do a lot better.

306
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,632
I don't know
what else I can do.

307
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,603
I've been you

308
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,104
and I went on interviews

309
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,441
and I realized I was filling
the room with desperation.

310
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:31,344
Five cents worth
of free advice.

311
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,313
You've got to spend
less time in this place

312
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:34,648
and more at home.

313
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:37,050
This is a reluctant necessity.

314
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:38,552
My mother's run amok.

315
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,622
Pete, one day
I looked in the mirror

316
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:45,325
and I realized I had regrets
because I didn't understand

317
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,060
the wellspring
of my confidence.

318
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:48,260
Gin?

319
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,128
My family.

320
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,065
My family is a constant
distraction.

321
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,734
You better manage that

322
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,570
or you're not gonna
manage anything.

323
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,276
<i>( dog barking )</i>

324
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,680
Hey, buddy.

325
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,458
Can you help me?

326
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,860
I'm occupied
at the moment, sir.

327
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:37,806
Hello there.

328
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:42,378
Oh.
Are you lost, too?

329
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,547
Not yet.

330
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,782
I'm trying to get some gas.

331
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:48,851
Lady asked for directions.

332
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,653
Fill 'er up with regular.

333
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,756
Where's Henry?

334
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,259
He's coming tomorrow.

335
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,394
I'm surprised you
were able to get away.

336
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,764
Where are you staying?

337
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:04,666
Somewhere over here.

338
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,305
Just go down here. Stay
on here a mile and a half

339
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,474
till you get to the big mill.
Make a left.

340
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:15,609
Go back through town
till the railroad tracks.

341
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,144
Hang a right over the bridge

342
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,212
and then you come
to the little mill.

343
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,181
Do any of the roads have names?

344
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,583
Follow me.

345
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,733
Fleischmann's just called.

346
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,268
See? You were worried
for nothing.

347
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,304
Well, they just requested some more
recent figures on market share.

348
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:38,840
I'll handle it.

349
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,541
Peggy, may I speak with you?
Go ahead.

350
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,380
What the hell were you
doing back there?

351
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,215
You didn't want me to talk.

352
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,019
I didn't talk. That was the plan.
Did you want me to talk?

353
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,587
- No, you touched my hand.
- What?

354
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,422
When you handed me the board.

355
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:57,990
What?
No, I didn't.

356
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes, you did. And you can't
do that in a presentation.

357
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,796
I doubt anyone saw that because
I didn't even know I did it.

358
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,832
It jarred me. And when I finally
caught up, then you smiled.

359
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,201
You can't smile
at me like that.

360
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,569
I never should have kissed you.

361
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,944
I assumed we were
forgetting about that.

362
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:23,915
I forgot it.

363
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,651
Well, I haven't.

364
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,320
Oh.

365
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,491
What an old tune.

366
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,661
The boss in love
with his protégé.

367
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:40,597
Is this all me?
Because that'll help.

368
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,466
I think about it.

369
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,104
Well, we can't. I have
someone, you have someone.

370
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:51,407
And believe me, I've considered
it a lot further than that.

371
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,643
I didn't know
you felt this way.

372
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,416
I don't want to,
that's the point.

373
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,885
Now I realize I never
should have brought it up.

374
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,889
Do you want me
to work someplace else?

375
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,557
No.

376
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:10,926
Of course not.

377
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,304
Come on, you have to do it.

378
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,075
And the left.

379
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,213

00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:35,481

Daddy, you came!

382
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,054
You didn't tell him I was here?

383
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,422
I wanted it to be a surprise.

384
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,158
You catch any fish?

385
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,161
Damn it, I made you a wallet,
but it's back in my cabin.

386
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,461
Bobby, language.

387
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,463
We'll get it later.

388
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,469
Mommy said we can have
anything we want.

389
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:59,872
Hi!

390
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,573
This is my mom and dad.

391
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,643
That's Bobby Two.
He's shy.

392
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:08,146
Are you Bobby or Bobby One?

393
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,613
I'm Bobby Five.

394
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,849
It's sad. There's no
Bobby One anymore.

395
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,617
Because of Bobby Kennedy?

396
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,586
No, he went home.

397
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,189
Do you want me to get the
waitress so you can get a drink?

398
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,058
- Is that possible?
- No.

399
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:25,061
Mommy's having a chef salad
and I'm having a cheeseburger.

400
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,863
What do you want
so I can order?

401
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,132
( chuckles ) What's good here?

402
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,334
I'm afraid nothing.

403
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,569
Daddy, I want
to teach you this song.

404
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,272

Can I walk you out?

417
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,105
Certainly, if you
don't mind waiting.

418
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,011
I need your advice.

419
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,580
And, well,
it's of a personal nature

420
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,850
and thus above Clara's
security clearance.

421
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,751
- How can I help you?
- ( sighs )

422
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,255
Do you feel my attention
to business has been dilute?

423
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,499
How personal
is this conversation?

424
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,170
I'm being pulled
in a million directions.

425
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,306
My wife, my child, my mother.

426
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,175
I can't solve
those problems, Pete.

427
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,943
I have those problems.

428
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,711
I live with my mother.

429
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,081
Has your mother exhausted
every nursing agency?

430
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,249
No, but she's exhausted me.

431
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,817
( chuckles ) Well...

432
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,153
the options are
my home and a home,

433
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,322
neither of which
will make me feel better.

434
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,324
I am sorry to hear that.

435
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:11,929
- Do you want to get supper?
- I can't. I have plans.

436
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,168
Thank you, Joan.

437
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:22,005
- For what?
- I don't know.

438
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:29,771
Welcome.

439
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,739
Oh, I'm a little damp.

440
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:33,374
Did it finally rain?

441
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,277
No, but I walked.
This was cold when I left.

442
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,445
You walked from the West Side?

443
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,549
What an incredible space.

444
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,050
Did you do this yourself?

445
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:46,186
Oh, I had a little help.

446
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,723
Arlene, you read about the
shootings in the park, didn't you?

447
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,825
I'm not gonna let
a few lunatics

448
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,592
ruin a gorgeous night
like this.

449
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:55,461
( laughs )

450
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,134
Should I go get my script?

451
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,870
Megan, darling,

452
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:06,739
you're a good actress

453
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:08,640
on your way to becoming, well,

454
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,442
at least a successful one.

455
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,711
There's nothing I can
tell you about that script.

456
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:14,679
I came over here because
I'm worried about you.

457
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:16,748
Am I gonna get fired?

458
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,852
I remember my first job.

459
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,454
Believe it or not, in radio.

460
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,288
"Against the Storm."

461
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:28,425
Very classy, a lot of
big words, high morals.

462
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,794
And my agent,
who I later learned

463
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:32,596
was angling
to sign Roger DeKoven,

464
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,665
told me my voice was childish.

465
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:36,567
And every day I would
vacillate between

466
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:39,035
"Arlene, you're wonderful"
and "Arlene, you're caca."

467
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,403
( laughs )

468
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,505
Which was it?

469
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,540
Honestly?

470
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:46,576
I was wonderful.

471
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,745
( laughs )

472
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,980
- <i>( crickets chirping )</i>
- <i>( owl hoots )</i>

473
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,050
You should go inside.

474
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,885
You'll get eaten
alive out here.

475
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,220
You know mosquitos ignore me.

476
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:00,889
In those shorts?

477
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,128
Did you find a bottle?

478
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,865
Maybe.

479
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,667
( chuckles )

480
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:22,175
<i>( pouring )</i>

481
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,946
- Cheers.
- <i>( clinks )</i>

482
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,854
( sighs ) I loved camp.

483
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,692
I never went.

484
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,594
Yes, you did.

485
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:46,398
Remember when we went to Lake
Champlain with my parents?

486
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,569
I remember.

487
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,538
And you got in a horrible
fight with my father

488
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:54,372
about who would
carry the luggage.

489
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,811
And then we went in the
woods and made Sally.

490
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,681
( sighs )
I don't understand her.

491
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,585
Henry says
she's a lot like you.

492
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,720
How would he know?

493
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:11,989
He says she reminds him of you.

494
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:14,258
I think she's a lot like you.

495
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,395
Bobby reminds me of my father.

496
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,064
So bossy.

497
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,069
All the teenagers
of the world are in revolt.

498
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,710
What were we like?

499
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,246
You and me?

500
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,953
When I saw you earlier today

501
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:46,889
I thought for a second,
"Who is that man?"

502
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,692
And I forgot how mad
I was at you.

503
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:56,664
Ugh, I don't know what's
happened, but I'm all bit up.

504
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,364
Close the door.
You'll let the bugs in.

505
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,450
What are you doing?

506
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:56,587
Waiting for you
to tell me to stop.

507
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,570
What did you think
when you saw me?

508
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:16,539
That you are as beautiful
as the day I met you.

509
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,818
So finally I said to Mel,

510
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:33,121
"I'm either his mother or his girlfriend.
I can't be both."

511
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,823
That's bad writing.

512
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,025
You're so lucky he's at work.

513
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,128
Please, dear, that's a
complex relationship.

514
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:42,229
But he understands what you do

515
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,098
and he wants you to be great.

516
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:46,400
And he's always proud of you.
I've seen it.

517
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,970
Don's very proud of you.

518
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,639
You can tell
by how protective he is.

519
00:27:53,842 --> 00:27:56,510
It's been so different.

520
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,614
You know, we worked together
and I left to pursue this.

521
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,682
And he was so encouraging.

522
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:05,351
And then you
started succeeding.

523
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:07,320
He's old-fashioned.

524
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,922
He'll get used to it.

525
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,257
I think he did.

526
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:15,327
And I think he got used
to me not being around

527
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,497
and having a bunch of problems
that he couldn't solve.

528
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,034
And I don't know

529
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,604
if it's him or me, but...

530
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,372
I feel so lonely.

531
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,746
Arlene.

532
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,447
What?

533
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,982
I want to make you feel better.

534
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,451
This isn't the way.

535
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,755
Forget it.

536
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,391
I can't believe you.

537
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:51,995
I'm trusting you and you're taking
advantage of every private moment.

538
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,132
Well, what was I
supposed to think?

539
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,501
You invited me over.

540
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,070
Your husband's not here.

541
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,937
Two bottles of wine
to go over a scene

542
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,438
a child could understand.

543
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,174
"I'm so lonely."

544
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,843
I work with you and your
husband is my boss.

545
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:09,478
And now what am I
supposed to do?

546
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,881
Am I gonna be punished
for not doing something

547
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,849
that you won't stop
trying to do?

548
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,918
Megan, it's okay to say no.

549
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:18,286
But you don't have
to embarrass me.

550
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,955
( sighs ) I'm sorry.

551
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,424
I didn't mean to.

552
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,993
No, stop it.

553
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,795
You're a tease.

554
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,329
Fine.

555
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:32,200
No, I'm fine
with being a tease.

556
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:35,202
( chuckles )

557
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,171
Well, honey,

558
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,872
just learn the lines.

559
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,809
Two characters is tough,
but you know what Olivier says,

560
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,811
let the wig do the work.

561
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,148
I'm gonna go
before I--

562
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,417
well, it's too late
for that, isn't it?

563
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,086
Thank you for that.

564
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:56,989
No hard feelings.

565
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:59,092
Status quo ante bellum.

566
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:01,594
Everything as it was.

567
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:05,563
<i>( door opens )</i>

568
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:06,976

569
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,978
( laughs )

570
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,613
I missed you.

571
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,992
Do you feel guilty?

572
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:40,128
No.

573
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:42,630
This happened a long time ago.

574
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:54,507
Ugh, menthols.

575
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,677
I don't miss that.

576
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:07,686
Is this what it would have been
like if we'd stayed together?

577
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,558
I don't think about
that anymore.

578
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:17,062
I'm happy in my life.

579
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,364
Let's just enjoy this.

580
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,600
But you used to?

581
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:26,537
What are you thinking
right now?

582
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,241
I'm thinking about
how different you are,

583
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:32,243
before and after.

584
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:37,115
I love the way you look at me
when you're like this.

585
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,951
But then I watch it decay.

586
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:45,422
I can only hold
your attention so long.

587
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,395
Why is sex

588
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,564
the definition of being
close to someone?

589
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:57,800
I don't know,

590
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,768
but it is for me.

591
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:01,871
It is for most people.

592
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,342
Just because you climb a mountain
doesn't mean you love it.

593
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,044
Climbing a mountain?

594
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:10,345
Is that what
making love is to you?

595
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:13,448
If we'd lied here together
with you in my arms,

596
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,917
I would have felt
just as close.

597
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:19,287
Not the rest of it.
I don't know.

598
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:23,959
I don't know.

599
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,126
It doesn't mean
that much to me.

600
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:30,264
Is it the same with Megan?

601
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,235
Why do you want
to talk about that?

602
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,636
( sighs ) That poor girl.

603
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:44,844
She doesn't know
that loving you

604
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,546
is the worst way to get to you.

605
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,667
Are you sure you don't
want to just hold me?

606
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:27,051
( hammering )

607
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,424
Oh, Jesus.

608
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,360
Oh, thank God.
What are you doing in here?

609
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,062
I was just fixing the window.

610
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,563
What the hell happened here?

611
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:42,732
I'll replace it tomorrow
when I get back from work.

612
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:44,367
Because you're leaving me here

613
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,135
after someone threw a rock
through our window?

614
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,736
That's not what happened.

615
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,672
Well, I came in here and there's
glass all over the floor

616
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,942
and you're holding a rock.

617
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:55,610
I'm tired of being
interrogated in my own home.

618
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,380
Do you think they saw you
talking to the police?

619
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:00,449
If you're gonna let
your imagination run wild,

620
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:01,650
come to the paper
with me tonight.

621
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:03,818
Abe, I have to go
to work tomorrow.

622
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,286
And this is our bedroom.

623
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,255
Someone was in our yard.

624
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:09,123
I'm really scared here.

625
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,592
And you're going to protect me?
You only have one hand.

626
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:18,765
You're right.
You're right.

627
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,969
We'll start looking.
Put it on the market.

628
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,540
You'd really do that for me?

629
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:30,444
Maybe we're not cut out
to be pioneers.

630
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,124
Sleep in the parlor if you're worried.
I won't wake you.

631
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,995
( phone rings )

632
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:51,329
Hello?

633
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:54,699
You took a four-year-old
to see "Planet of the Apes"?

634
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:57,302
He's been having
nightmares all night.

635
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:58,769
Hold on, hold on.

636
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:00,472
He wanted to see that.

637
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:02,240
He doesn't decide that.

638
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,142
Well, Don took his kid.

639
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:07,344
Don Draper, Father of the Year.

640
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,313
Margaret, honey, he loved it.

641
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:12,116
Put him on, I'll do Dr. Zaius again.
He laughs like an idiot.

642
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,751
( imitating ) The Forbidden
Zone was once a paradise.

643
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,720
You're not funny, Daddy.

644
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:19,789
We'll probably have to get rid of
the dog; he's that afraid of fur.

645
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,994
Listen, I saw "The Golem"
when I was his age.

646
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:25,795
You don't even know
what scary is.

647
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,463
I was fine.
It's not my fault.

648
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,800
Yeah, you're right.
It's my fault.

649
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:33,102
For letting you talk me
into having a four-year-old

650
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,571
watch another
four-year-old.

651
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:37,641
Listen to me, young lady,
you calm down this minute.

652
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:39,441
No, Daddy, you listen to me.

653
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,844
You can keep up your fantasy
of acting like a father,

654
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,445
but your grandfather
days are done.

655
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,448
I'm sorry you're upset.
I'm coming over.

656
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,283
- I'll calm him down.
- <i>No.</i>

657
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,252
And call Mother next time
you want to see him

658
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:52,487
'cause she has to be there.

659
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:58,726
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

660
00:36:07,202 --> 00:36:09,370

661
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:25,151
- Morning.
- Good morning.

662
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:26,786
Good to see you.

663
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:52,879
It's such a project
going to the beach.

664
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,380
Can I go get Kevin?

665
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,082
Let him sleep a little more.

666
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,251
I'd love to get one
of those summer rentals.

667
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,820
Doesn't Pete Campbell
have a beach house?

668
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,656
I wouldn't ask him
for anything.

669
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,191
- Don't you like him?
- It's not that.

670
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:09,028
Actually,
he's the only person there

671
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,663
who's never broken
a promise to me.

672
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,765
He's a very generous person.

673
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,067
And frankly, I think
he's having a rough time.

674
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,269
So he told you
about his mother?

675
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,737
No, I wish he would have.
What's wrong?

676
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:22,040
He needs a nurse.

677
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,341
He's not gonna ask you.
He's too ashamed.

678
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,011
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
- She back from the track already?

679
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:30,048
Ugh, she must have
forgotten her keys.

680
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,518
Oh, hello, Roger.

681
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,389
- Who are you?
- It's me, Bob Benson.

682
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,457
From the office.

683
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,995
What are you doing here?

684
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,430
Oh, I was out shopping

685
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:50,167
and I realized I had
misplaced some paperwork.

686
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,634
And I, uh--

687
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,403
what are you two doing?

688
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,038
We're leaving for the beach.

689
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,174
- You know what? I should go get the car.
- Good idea.

690
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,242
No, Mr. Sterling
is just leaving.

691
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,013
Roger, I'm sure
this can wait till Monday.

692
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,015
Sure, absolutely.
Sorry about that, Bob.

693
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:09,283
I guess we're all a little bit
out of context right now.

694
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,119
I take no offense.

695
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,198
Didn't know you were friends.

696
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,134
Some people never stop working.

697
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,636
I'm going to freshen up
and we'll get out of here.

698

Why didn't you say something?

You're going to make it.
He's going to make it.

Look, I don't want you to think
this is about what you did.

714
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,827
It was an accident.
I feel horrible.

No, you're scared.

718
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,138
Save your strength. You're
not making any sense.

( groans ) I don't know why
I thought you'd be braver.

You're... in advertising.

721
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,413
Don't do this right now.
I said I was sorry.

722
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:56,251
Your activities are offensive
to my every waking moment.

723
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,287
I'm sorry...

724
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:02,089

00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,263
Oh, you're back.

00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,035
Did you have fun?

733
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,372
I missed you.

734
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,576
Well, I miss you all the time.

735
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,782

but I'm here.

739
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:22,599
I keep trying to make things
the way they used to be,

740
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,901
but I don't know how.

741
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:27,103
And maybe that's stupid

742
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,672
or young to think
like that, but...

743
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:34,277
something has to change.

744
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,147
Megan...

745
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:47,589
You're right.

746
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:49,591
I haven't been here.

747
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,654
Roger, please.

748
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,589
Come on, just take it.

749
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,990
They're Lincoln Logs.

750
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:27,626
I thought maybe he'd build
his mother a house.

751

You can't drop in
on me like that.

752
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,196
But I want to.

753
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,333
Oh, Roger, I'm so sorry,

754
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,968
but you can't do this.

755
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,369
Why not?

756
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:39,671
Because it's too confusing.

757
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:41,873
For Kevin.
You know.

758
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:45,242
But I'm his father.

759
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,278
No, his father is Greg.

760
00:42:47,312 --> 00:42:48,880
But I'm here.

761
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:52,617
For now.

762
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:56,353
But every day Greg
is some hero out there.

763
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,389
And I'd rather him think
that is the man in his life.

764
00:42:59,423 --> 00:43:02,626
Who's gonna watch TV with him?
Bob Bunson?

765
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,695
I just want to be around.

766
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:07,430
I know you want to.

767
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:09,700
But I can't count on that.

768
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,677
Thank you for the gift.

769
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:36,590
Something delicate
has come to my attention.

770
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,160
Have a seat.

771
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:42,897
I...

772
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:45,733
I've really debated whether
to bring this up with you

773
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:49,170
because I don't want to put
you in a strange position

774
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:53,140
and in the end
it's probably just gossip.

775
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,412
It's come to my attention

776
00:43:58,446 --> 00:44:01,348
that you may be in need
of a nurse for your mother.

777
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:03,650
Joan had no right
to tell you that.

778
00:44:05,053 --> 00:44:07,086
His name is Manolo Colón.

779
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,688
He's an army-trained
registered nurse

780
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:11,490
and he's available now
only because

781
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:14,060
he's brought my father
back to full health.

782
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:21,167
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise Mother will refuse.

783
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,435
He's very well-bred.

784
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:29,006
And don't blame Joan.

785
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,675
She was concerned about you

786
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,743
and had exhausted her resources

787
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,512
and is well aware
that your well-being

788
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,614
is also an interest of mine.

I just wanted to--

797
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,908
I needed to talk to you.

798

Peggy, what's wrong?

Abe got stabbed.

801
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:18,620
My goodness. Is he okay?
What happened?

802
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,788
He's going to be fine.

803
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,758

I'm sorry to hear that.

806
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,394
You are?

807
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,064
You'll find someone else.

808
00:45:42,098 --> 00:45:44,999
And whoever he is,
he's lucky to have you.

809
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,472
Thank you.

810
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:52,274

How was your weekend?

How'd it go with Fleischmann's?
