2
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:04,608
I hope you left us something.

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:10,087
You will be here only
<i>when I tell you to be here.</i>

4
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:11,372
We're done, Peter.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:12,694
Have a happy birthday.

6
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:13,844
How old are you gonna be?

7
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:15,618
Forty.

8
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,002
So when you're forty,
how old will I be?

9
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,460
You'll be dead.

10
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:21,398
My boss made a call.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,230
You told Mayor Lindsay.

12
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:28,982
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

16

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,853
<i>I do believe that was</i>
<i>everything on your list.</i>

22
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,489
It's a little farther east
than I wanted.

23
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,458
In fact, it's about
as far east as you could go.

24
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,093
You can see the highway
from the corner.

25
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,461
You can see the river.

26
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,063
And who needs Central Park

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,799
when you can smell the ocean
and the Hungarian bakeries?

28
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,051
Believe me, when they finish
the Second Avenue subway,

29
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,837
this apartment
will quadruple in value.

30
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,856
Oh, that's Barbara.

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,224
You let me do the talking.

32
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,145
Sorry I'm late.

33
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,982
It's quite a hike
between First and York.

34
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,950
It's got to be longer
than a normal block.

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,585
I don't think so.

36
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,637
We just got started.

37
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,556
What do you think?

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,058
I think no one's gonna catch
that doorman napping.

39
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,327
I left your name.

40
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,746
It's got a doorman.

41
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,000
I was telling Peggy that an offer
is coming in at asking price.

42
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,551
We'd have to beat it.

43
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,403
So it's in your best interest
to be decisive

44
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,021
and take this property
seriously.

45
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,507
Well, okay,
but it's not my decision.

46
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,977
Ginny, we are taking
this seriously.

47
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,980
- What Abe means is--
- I'm more her trusted advisor.

48
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,216
An interested party.

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,418
Oh. I see.

50
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,087
I, uh, misunderstood.

51
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,590
I'm going to flush
that toilet again.

52
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,995
She didn't know
I wasn't the buyer?

53
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,964
So all this time
she was just being rude.

54
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,333
Forget about her.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,468
Is it too far east?

56
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,875
<i>Dinner.</i>

57
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,950
<i>Bobby, Sally, let's go.</i>

58
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,761
Look at you two.
Heading to the track?

59
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,316
- Where are you going?
- DC, if Jonesy can find a cab.

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,869
- Hope you're not in a rush.
- We have a car coming.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,004
6:30?
We should have done that.

62
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,656
We're not going
to miss the train.

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,157
Where are you going?

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,928
They said DC.

65
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,030
I mean, why are you going?

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,834
Arnie was invited last minute
to give a keynote address.

67
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,636
Did you have to tell him
it was last minute?

68
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,138
I guess the point is somebody
more important fell out.

69
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,057
It's a very
distinguished group.

70
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:04,093
And you must have been
at least as important.

71
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,613
Either way, it sounds like a good
excuse for a weekend in Washington.

72
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,984
Yes. Come Monday morning,
it'll all be a dream.

73
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,453
We should really go away.

74
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,355
Looks like you're going
somewhere fun now.

75
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,524
We are.
Megan's up for an award.

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,760
Good for you.
Maybe tomorrow

77
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,895
you'll be calling the producers
and asking for a raise.

78
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,497
No, it's for advertising.

79
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,098
The Ad Club of New York.

80
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,901
- Paul Newman's coming.
- My goodness.

81
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,670
You're really good
at everything.

82
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,339
I was just a name on the team.

83
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,808
There's the car.

84
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:38,110
Well, break a leg.

85
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,498
You, too.

86
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, and, Don...

87
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,985
we're going to DC.

88
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,434
Hey, Pop, I--

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,904
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

90
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,505
We were waiting for you.

91
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,458
Look, miss, whatever he told
you we were interested in,

92
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,345
- we're not.
- See how funny he is?

93
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,314
Now, don't be rude.
This is Beverly Farber.

94
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,083
She is Chaim Farber's daughter.

95
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm-- our dads,
they play chess together.

96
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,172
Oh, uh...

97
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,959
well, I...
it's nice to meet you.

98
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,478
And now that you're home
from a busy day

99
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,314
on Madison Avenue,

100
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,633
I think you should go out
and have some dinner.

101
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,168
What?

102
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,538
Maybe we should
do this another time.

103
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,341
Nonsense. There's no
time like the present.

104
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,710
<i>You both should have some fun.</i>

105
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,580
She's a schoolteacher.
She works all the time.

106
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,949
I need to shave,
change my clothes, prepare.

107
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,151
I mean, look at her.
She had a jump on me.

108
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,136
I did.

109
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,123
I was led to believe
that you knew about this.

110
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,225
- Why did you tell her that?
- What's the difference?

111
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,763
Look at her. I'm obviously
doing you a disservice.

112
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,037
At least we're close
to the kitchen.

113
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,639
It's not fair that all the
big agencies are up front.

114
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,274
Closer to their trophies.

115
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,992
But at least we're gonna
eat before them.

116
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,514
Oh, I see Peggy back there.
We should go say hello.

117
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,734
- I'm gonna wait for the group.
- You can't avoid her forever.

118
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,068
I'm not.

119
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,753
Tell her that no matter what,

120
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,740
her laxative radio spot
is the sentimental favorite.

121
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,367
<i>Hello, stranger.</i>

122
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,986
I was hoping I'd see you.

123
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,838
You know, other than on TV.

124
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,441
- You don't watch.
- My mother and sister do.

125
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,259
Really?
Do they hate me?

126
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,877
Oh, just a minute.

127
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,030
Megan, I want you
to meet Jim Cutler.

128
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,532
He's the president of CGC.

129
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,818
This is Megan Draper.
She's also a finalist.

130
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,386
You must be Don's wife.

131
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,987
When I started out,
they didn't make

132
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,956
copywriters like you.

133
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,474
Good luck.

134
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,613
He's the head of accounts.

135
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,898
He's like Roger
with bad breath.

136
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,634
So he knows who you are.
It must be going well.

137
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,353
If I survive tonight.

138
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,872
CGC has no other finalists.

139
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,707
Other-- they have none.

140
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,510
I only came because
it seemed important to Don.

141
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,646
I bet it is. We're the
only finalists from SCDP

142
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,115
and neither of us
work there anymore.

143
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,599
My work was for beans

144
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,252
and they aren't even
a client anymore.

145
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,104
I don't want
to talk about this.

146
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,072
I want to talk
about my apartment.

147
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,358
I made an offer today. I think
we're gonna be neighbors.

148
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,927
- 84th and York.
- You're buying a place?

149
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,663
Well, I paid off my debts
and helped out my mother

150
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,033
and it turns out I still
have this tax problem.

151
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,770
Don't apologize, Peggy.
You deserve it.

152
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,304
Thank you.

153
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,123
I should get back.

154
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,309
I have to walk all the
way down to the front.

155
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,895
You're terrible.

156
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,917
<i>These are the worst
seats in the room.</i>

157
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,003
- Don Draper, this is Randall Walsh.
- A pleasure to meet you.

158
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,923
Randy here is in insurance and he wants
to come in for an official visit.

159
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,926
Look, man, it's not like we're not
supposed to talk about business here.

160
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,995
You want a presentation
right now?

161
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,230
I don't think we'll interrupt the
proceedings, wherever they are.

162
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,767
- I just thought you two should meet.
- We've already met.

163
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,837
In fact, I'm pretty sure we've
had this meeting already, too.

164
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,440
- And it went well.
- So where's our check?

165
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,876
- He's solid.
- Okay, Randy.

166
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,712
Go get back in your cage.

167
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,566
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

168
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,989
Have no fear. They're
gonna fire off a cannon

169
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,808
when the atrocities begin.

170
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,510
Hello all.
You remember my wife Nan.

171
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,346
Hello, everyone.
Good luck.

172
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,966
I told you, Nan, Peggy's
the only one competing.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,035
Well, I didn't know
what else to say.

174
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,873
So you probably figured out
by now that you didn't win.

175
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,742
<i>- Ted. - But it doesn't matter,</i>
<i>because next year you will.</i>

176
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,078
- Ted.
- And the year after. Just a second, honey.

177
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,133
- Hey, man, sorry.
- Oh, I'm in your seat.

178
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,801
Nan, you wanted
to see Paul Newman.

179
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,320
Here he is.

180
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,023
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

181
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,676
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we would like to welcome you</i>

182
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,828
<i>to the Advertising Club</i>
<i>of New York's</i>

183
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:26,131
<i>Fourth Annual ANDY Awards for
Excellence in Advertising.</i>

184
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,410
So you like kids?

185
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,647
Excuse me?

186
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,349
I was asking because
you're a teacher,

187
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,985
but I realize how that could
sound like something else.

188
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm a student teacher.

189
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,122
I'm getting my master's
at Hunter.

190
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,593
And, yes, I like kids.
Some kids.

191
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,346
I just really can't believe he
brought you to the apartment.

192
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,516
Stop saying that. You
don't know where I live.

193
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,236
Well, it's kind of early
to find out, isn't it?

194
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,773
Yes, I suppose it is.

195
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,758
I don't know
what you're expecting.

196
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,227
I mean, a couple of alter kockers
arrange a little meeting like this,

197
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,396
it sounds very old world.
But it doesn't feel like it.

198
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,082
I mean, you're a sexy girl
and you smell great.

199
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,667
<i>You don't need to be set up.</i>

200
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,352
And I sure as hell
didn't arrange this.

201
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,120
I'm sure my father told you
what a Lothario I am,

202
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,689
but I'm not.
I'm very anxious about it.

203
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,791
I've never had sex,
not even once.

204
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,662
Okay.

205
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,436
What am I doing? I ordered
soup, I just said that.

206
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,539
Michael...

207
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,943
I'm just doing a favor
for my parents.

208
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,578
Tonight will not be the night.

209
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,616
And I saw a picture of you

210
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,484
and, honestly,
you're very handsome.

211
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,689
And I'm obviously very shallow.

212
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,860
- I am?
- You must have heard that before.

213
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,931
So...

214
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,899
do you make a lot
of money teaching?

215
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,635
No.

216
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,771
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, Paul Newman.</i>

217
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,717
<i>Good evening.
I am Paul Newman.</i>

218
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>The Advertising Club</i>
<i>of New York</i>

219
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,023
has been kind enough to let me
say a few words here tonight.

220
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,460
And I want to make one thing
clear from the very start.

221
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,495
- I need binoculars.
- Shh.

222
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,230
<i>I'm not here
because I'm an actor.</i>

223
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,733
We invited him
because he's an actor.

224
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,901
<i>I'm here because I've got six</i>
<i>kids and I'm worried about their future.</i>

225
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,903
That's not an actor,
that's a speck.

226
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,306
Gene McCarthy stood up
to Lyndon Johnson

227
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,841
before Bobby Kennedy.

228
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,310
<i>The others backed into</i>
<i>the election</i>

229
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,845
<i>with their fingers to the wind,</i>

230
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,613
<i>thinking of their own career</i>
<i>when the nation</i>

231
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,149
<i>was in critical need of a hero.</i>

232
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,184
I know Bobby Kennedy,

233
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,186
but I'm supporting
Gene McCarthy

234
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,155
<i>for President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

235
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,898
<i>Mr. Newman, sir.</i>

236
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,284
<i>Do you know, Mr. Newman, sir, that</i>
<i>Martin Luther King is dead?</i>

237
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,204
<i>What have you to say?</i>

238
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,073
No, that can't be.

239
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,659
Who the hell said that?

240
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,012
How awful.

241
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,336
If I could have your
attention for a moment, please.

242
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,288
<i>A moment of your attention.</i>

243
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,490
<i>Not wanting to interrupt</i>
<i>the festivities,</i>

244
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,894
we hoped to keep this news
until the end of the event.

245
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:46,098
As it stands,
let's take 10 minutes

246
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,500
<i>to talk out this terrible event</i>

247
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,836
<i>and then resume the program.</i>

248
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,276
What do you think happened?

249
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,412
- What do you think?
- Come on.

250
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,821
I guess Puerto Rico.

251
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,822
But who has time?

252
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,927
Your father says you've even
written some billboards.

253
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,795
That must be exciting.

254
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,264
You'd think so, but they
usually change it so much

255
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,117
by the time they put it up there, it just
makes you angry every time you walk by.

256
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,886
<i>...in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

257
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,605

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,742

260
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,048

<i>confirmed Dr. King's death.</i>

261
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,118
- <i>Reverend Dr. King, winner</i>
<i>of the Nobel Peace Prize...</i> - Oh, my God.

262
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,320
- <i>...was 39 years old.</i>
- They had to do it.

263
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,355
<i>He was in Memphis</i>

<i>from the scene of the shooting</i>

269
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,835
<i>and reportedly dropped</i>
<i>the weapon in flight.</i>

270
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,922
What are you doing in here?
Thought you'd be by the set.

271
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,941
- She won't let us watch. - Because who
knows what they're going to show?

272
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,228
You don't have to go.

273
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,163
Betty, they're gonna
burn down the city.

274
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,886
Everything's fine.
I have to go help the mayor.

275
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
Please be careful.

276
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,925
- And call me.
<i>- We repeat,</i>

What is taking so long?

279
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,234
There are other people here
who need to make calls.

280
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,638
They shot him in the face
in Memphis.

281
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,390
Do they know who?

282
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,559
Come on, they didn't catch
him yet, but you know who.

283
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:41,847
Listen, Jimmy says they can get me a
photographer if I can get uptown.

284
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,715
No, it's not a good idea.

285
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,851
It's the "New York Times."

286
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,087
- And what?
- It's a huge story.

287
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:56,328
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Peggy, it's too late.

288
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,513
I'm going to Harlem
in a tuxedo.

289
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,105
I can't believe this.

290
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,509
Abe just went uptown for work.

291
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,744
I'm sick and I don't even know
how I'm gonna get home.

292
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,097
We'll give you a ride.

293
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,482
I'm tired of waiting for a phone.
I'm going home.

294
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,288
What are we doing? They're
really still having the awards?

295
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,789
What else are we gonna do?

296
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,968
Look, I'm sure
it's hard to sleep.

297
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,036
What is that?

298
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,773
What are you doing?

299
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:47,076
I didn't do it.
It peeled off.

300
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,578
Why are you
destroying this house?

301
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:52,481
You can't do this.

302
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,183
I didn't do anything.

303
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,285
I don't want
to talk about it now.

304
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,674
Please just go to sleep.

305
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,795
...the Civil Rights
Movement

306
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,298

in Memphis, Tennessee.

307
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,400
Police have issued
an all-points bulletin...

308
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:12,568
It's me.

309
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,037
Oh.

310
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,039
How are you?

311
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,943
Not good.

312
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:24,046
I don't know why
I'm so surprised.

313
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,348
It's shameful.

314
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:28,217
Listen, I...

315
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,887
I don't want you
and Tammy to be alone.

316
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:34,990
I could come out and sleep
there tonight if you want.

317
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,895
No, I--

318
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:41,897
we'll be fine.

319
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,667
Well, I want to see Tammy.

320
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,636
Is she all right?

321
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,972
She doesn't know
what's going on.

322
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:53,275
No, of course.

323
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,160
I'll see you on Saturday.

324
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:58,047
No, I'll just tell my parents

325
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,781
you couldn't get out
of the city.

326
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,185
Or I'll just cancel it
altogether.

327
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:05,287
Trudy.

328
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,989
What?

329
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,260
I don't want you to be worried.

330
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,662
Okay.

331
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,798
<i>In a nationwide

Dr. King,

Pop, wake up.

Martin Luther King got killed.

345
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:03,812
<i>...try and cool things down.</i>

346
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,447
In Boston,
according to police reports,

347
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,816
a large crowd of Negroes
stoned six police cruisers

348
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:11,086
near a Negro housing project
in the Roxbury section.

349
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,922
<i>And there was a clash between</i>
<i>police and young Negroes</i>

350
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,492
in Raleigh's main
downtown streets tonight.

351
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:19,128
The latest report of trouble
comes from Washington, DC,

352
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:21,130
<i>where stores along</i>
<i>a six-block area</i>

353
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:23,799
<i>were broken into</i>
<i>late this evening.</i>

354
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,934
- I don't agree with you, Papa.
- President Johnson went on nationwide

355
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,570
television to express his shock
and personal grief at the tragedy.

356
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,472
_

357
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,482
_

358
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,383
_

359
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:37,979
...looking subdued and grim
at the thought

360
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,982
of what this act
could mean in a country

361
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,583
already taut
with racial tension.

362
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,987
He said he applauded
the escalation of decay.

363
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:48,056
So sick of that
Marxist bullshit.

364
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,709
So far it's only
looting in Harlem,

365
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,695
but a lot of places
are on fire.

366
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,964
Well, it's raining.

367
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,167
Do you think
your secretary is okay?

368
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:01,837
Sylvia and Arnold are in DC.

369
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:05,407
My father just hides
behind his intellect.

370
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,926
He doesn't want
to feel any emotions.

371
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,412
Let's watch inside.

372
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,314
Maybe we can fall asleep.

373
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,801
_

374
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,553
Am I disturbing you?

375
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:37,005
No. I'm not gonna judge you
if you want a drink.

376
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,974
The man knew how to talk.

377
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:41,443
I don't know why, but I
thought that would save him.

378
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,512
I thought it would solve
the whole thing.

379
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:49,318
Oh, I don't know if he
just wants to hold hands,

380
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,436
but my insurance friend
from last night, he called.

381
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,388
He wants to come in
at 3:00.

382
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,540
I'll have Caroline remind you
since you're on your own.

383
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,092
Could you get the door?

384
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:12,341
Yes, actually, I'm trying
to reach Dr. Rosen.

385
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,710
No, I'm not a patient.

386
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:17,679
I just know that
he's in Washington and--

387
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:21,750
well, I was concerned.

388
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,485
I'm his neighbor.

389
00:20:26,072 --> 00:20:29,357
Oh, well, if you do reach him,

390
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,360
just say...

391
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,895
actually, no message.

392
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,430
I'll try later.

393
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,559
Oh, you're here.

394
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,745
I'm sorry. There's no
reception out there.

395
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,415
No, I just-- I didn't
expect you to come in.

396
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,500
I kept calling
and no one answered.

397
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,486
We went out
to my aunt's in Newark.

398
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,887
Why would you do that?

399
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:01,390
My mother wanted
to be with her sister.

400
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,761
Abe said it could
have been a lot worse.

401
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,866
I'm so sorry.

402
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,641
I knew it was going to happen.

403
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:22,577
He knew it was going to happen.

404
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:25,380
But it's not gonna
stop anything.

405
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,504
And these fools
running in the streets--

406
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,923
it's exactly
what he didn't want.

407
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:38,226
You should go home.

408
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,228
In fact, none of us
should be working.

409
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,563
Thank you.

410
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:54,843
Is this really what happened?

411
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,645
You didn't tell me anything.

412
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,781
They got it right,
except that it was terrifying.

413
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:02,284
Walking into that angry,
crazy crowd

414
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:05,971
and Lindsay smiling like he was
going to a pancake breakfast.

415
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,490
The only lives His Honor seemed
worried about protecting

416
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:10,359
were the photographers'.

417
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,928
- But it worked.
- I'll tell you what worked.

418
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:15,430
Cutting deals with all
the militants last year.

419
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,716
Well, I'm glad you were there.

420
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,852
Me, too.
And I got to go back in.

421
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:23,238
I want you to eat
something first.

422
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:29,044
Clara.

423
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,179
Have you seen Scarlett?

424
00:22:31,214 --> 00:22:32,481
Where's my girl?

425
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,752
They must all be
watching TV somewhere.

426
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:40,021
- Not in my office.
- I barely slept last night.

427
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,524
I just thought working
might take my mind off things.

428
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,926
Good luck. Been on the
phone all morning.

429
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:47,028
They're worried about
last night, obviously,

430
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,864
but they're worried about tonight,
they're worried about the weekend.

431
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:50,732
- Who?
- The clients.

432
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,818
They won't take make-goods.
They want money back.

433
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,003
- That's disgusting.
- I don't know.

434
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:57,105
It's enough
of this crap already.

435
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,408
All these special broadcasts
preempting the prime-time schedule.

436
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,843
"Bewitched," Merv, Dean Martin.

437
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:03,445
You know they might
cancel the Stanley Cup?

438
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,480
How dare you?

439
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:07,616
This cannot be made good.

440
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,351
It's shameful.

441
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,419
It's a shameful, shameful day!

442
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,254
Don't you scream at me.

443
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:14,856
You don't think I'm upset
about that man being shot?

444
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,892
Only because it's
costing you, you pig!

445
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:18,560
It's costing all of us.

446
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,545
And when's it gonna stop?
No one will be happy

447
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,731
until they turn the most beautiful
city in the world into a shit hole.

448
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:25,567
- Gentlemen, stop it. Stop it this minute.
- In a second, Bert.

449
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,737
Did you know we were in the
presence of a bona fide racist?

450
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:31,540
That's the latest thing, isn't it?
Everybody's a racist.

451
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,609
Gentlemen!

452
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:38,513
I urge you to shake hands in the
spirit of erasing these remarks.

453
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:47,739
I suppose that my comments
were inappropriate.

455
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,225
I mistook this for a workday.

456
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,344
Don't worry. I'm sure you
can make your money back

457
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:53,979
on some Movie of the Week
next fall

458
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,297
about the death of a great man.

459
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,133
That is not what I meant.

460
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,435
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

461
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,138
That man had a wife
and four children.

462
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,699
I'm sorry I'm late.

463
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,117
Would you like coffee?

464
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:17,752
Dawn, I'm just glad
you're okay.

465
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:19,320
Joan was trying to reach you.

466
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,323
The phone was out
for a little bit last night

467
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:23,892
and, well, it took
some time to get here.

468
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,894
I don't think
you should work today.

469
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,280
I couldn't reach you. I assumed
you weren't coming in.

470
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:30,365
My mother told me I should.

471
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:35,303
Well, Mr. Cooper just
announced that out of respect

472
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,038
we're going to close
the office early.

473
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:39,441
- Oh.
- That's probably a good idea.

474
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,994
- Mr. Sterling still wants to have the
3:00 meeting. - Are we closed or not?

475
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,847
Stan and Ginsberg will also be joining.
Do you want to cancel it?

476
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:48,917
- If you're gonna stay, I'll stay.
- No, you go.

477
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:51,636
I'd really rather
be here today.

478
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:55,256
Okay.

479
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,050
We're all so sorry.

480
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,038
Do you want anything?

481
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,974
No.

482
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,527
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

483
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:27,562
- This is Peggy.
- Oh.

484
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:30,498
I was about to send over your
offer and it occurred to me--

485
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,518
Oh, my offer. I completely
forgot about that.

486
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:36,004
- You haven't sent it?
- No, I haven't.

487
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,540
Well, no one's gonna want
to look at that today.

488
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:40,108
May I speak?

489
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:42,494
I thought the same thing,
but then I realized

490
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:44,246
there's trouble 10 blocks away.

491
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,047
They're probably
on pins and needles.

492
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:49,084
So am I. Do I want
to live up there?

493
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,020
Get ahold of yourself.
The other buyer never came in.

494
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:54,222
Why don't we come in
at 5,000 under asking

495
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,874
and give them 24 hours
to respond?

496
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,909
<i>We'll let the TV news</i>
<i>do the rest.</i>

497
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,629
- I don't know.
- This is the only apartment for you.

498
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:02,697
You don't want to be
kicking yourself next week.

499
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:05,066
And, of course, I'll wait
until tomorrow to present.

500
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:09,704
Good girl.

501
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:17,963
Randall Walsh,
you remember Don.

502
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:20,882
This is Stan Rizzo
and Michael Ginsberg.

503
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,826
Randall, would you
like a drink?

504
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,062
Never. I really don't
even want to talk.

505
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:37,098
I was trying to communicate without
words, but it's not working.

506
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,434
Randy, it never works.

507
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:43,004
Randall has an idea and the ad
director won't take a chance.

508
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,273
You're in the property
insurance business.

509
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:48,043
I'll bet you're about
to get hit pretty hard.

510
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,911
Forget about that.

511
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,047
This is about
a no bullshit approach

512
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,748
to why I got
into this business.

513
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,084
People say they care.

514
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,520
I really care.

515
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,143
We're waiting for you, Randall.

516
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:09,781
All I see when I close my eyes

517
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:13,952
is our name
and a Molotov cocktail

518
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,954
being lit with a match.

519
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,406
And then a coupon
at the bottom.

520
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,978
The ad sales guy
didn't like that?

521
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,480
I know what it looks like--
fearmongering.

522
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,516
But this is the opposite.

523
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,885
This is a coded message
that came to me

524
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,686
when I was visited
by the spirit

525
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:34,289
of Dr. King last night.

526
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:37,592
He said that I should question
the whole property thing, man.

527
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:40,795
It makes you happy, right?

528
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:45,233
No, I think it was

529
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:48,103
his end will always
be in poor taste.

530
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:50,438
'Cause you'd rather
not think about it.

531
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:52,874
But there is a tear,
and in that tear

532
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,477
are all the tears in the world,

533
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,246
all the animals crying.

534
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,584
You're right-- I don't
want to think about it.

535
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:05,103
What Don's saying is
despite what we believe

536
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,805
to be good intentions,

537
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:09,057
you're allowing
the emotions of the day,

538
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:12,260
and whatever else you got in your
system, to influence your judgment.

539
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:14,529
Are you forgetting
what Tecumseh said?

540
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,734
Heya howa howa hoya.

541
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,471
- Heya howa howa.
- I had forgotten that.

542
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,156
We'll think about it.

543
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,996
This is an opportunity.

544
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:33,782
The heavens
are telling us to change.

545
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:39,554
You talked
to Dr. King's ghost?

546
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,489
Make sure Randy
doesn't get lost.

547
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,912
- I had to wait around for that?
- I don't know.

548
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,915
He was very emotional.
He talked me off a roof once.

549
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:52,500
I kind of owed him.
You want a drink?

550
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,135
I just want to go home.

551
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,187
Someone's gonna do
that idea, you know.

552
00:28:56,222 --> 00:28:57,889
Not us.

553
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,345
<i>Three deaths have been reported</i>

554
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:05,380
<i>in the Washington</i>
<i>rioting so far.</i>

555
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:08,500
<i>There are no details yet on the
circumstances surrounding them.</i>

556
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,620
<i>More than 350 persons have
been treated for injuries.</i>

557
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:14,489
<i>Among them, several policemen and firemen.</i>

558
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:16,858
<i>Firefighting was hampered</i>
<i>if for no other reason</i>

559
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:19,094
<i>by the sheer volume</i>
<i>of the alarms.</i>

560
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:22,364
<i>But still, some persons</i>
<i>were injured and...</i>

561
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,700
<i>It's Betty. You're supposed</i>
<i>to pick up the kids.</i>

562
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:28,003
Oh, shit.

563
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:33,608
Got it.
Hello.

564
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,110
I knew you would forget.

565
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:37,278
You really want them down here?

566
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:40,482
I know you don't. You get out of
every opportunity to see them.

567
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,517
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>how strange they're acting.</i>

568
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,269
The news is very upsetting.

569
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,887
I'm sure it has nothing
to do with the fact

570
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,489
that their father
forgot about them.

571
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,324
You want me to come up
there and get them,

572
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:51,493
drive right through
everything after dark?

573
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:53,294
Well, of course,
Henry thinks it's fine,

574
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,296
but he's not as concerned
about their safety as you are.

575
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,165
Well, Henry would know.

576
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,701
I guarantee you'd go
to Canada on your knees

577
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:01,436
to pick up your girlfriend.

578
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,089
I don't believe this.

579
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:07,575
I'm going to get the kids.

580
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,311
<i>...relatively little interference
during the afternoon.</i>

581
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,598
Really?

582
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,583
They called in the troops
in Washington,

583
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,536
but Henry says we're fine here.

584
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:20,989
She's a piece of work.

585
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:23,808
<i>Looting spread to the downtown</i>
<i>shopping section of the city</i>

586
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,794
<i>and as darkness fell,</i>
<i>arrests increased.</i>

587
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:44,879
You finished with that?
You can walk me to work.

588
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:47,315
I'm already at work.

589
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,085
Since when are you
going in on Saturday?

590
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,987
Since I don't want to be
in front of the TV set.

591
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:56,624
Good as new.

592
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:58,643
This?

593
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:00,662
This is a mess.

594
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:04,232
You can't sew, you can't
cook, you can't clean.

595
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:07,568
You don't think there's a reason
you have all these flaws?

596
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,771
You need a girl.

597
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,706
But maybe you don't like 'em.

598
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,675
I like girls, Dad.

599
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,244
If that was true, you'd be
in bed with her right now.

600
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,513
I don't think
anybody's in the mood.

601
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:20,398
It's quite the opposite.

602
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,350
Now's the time
when a man and a woman

603
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,285
need to be together the most.

604
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,172
In a catastrophe.

605
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:30,125
In the flood, the animals
went two by two.

606
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,193
You, you're gonna get on
the ark with your father.

607
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,595
I can find my own girls, okay?

608
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,448
Okay.

609
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,918
I'll bring you a sandwich.

610
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,342
I'm glad you finally slept.

611
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:16,311
What's going on?

612
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,146
We're going to a vigil
in the park.

613
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,818
- You're not supposed to be watching TV.
- I'm not.

614
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:25,754
You are, and Mom
said you can't.

615
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,590
Sally, stop it.

616
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:30,592
Troy and Bridget called.
They're gonna meet us there.

617
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:32,193
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

618
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:35,113
I don't feel well.

619
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:40,068
You go on ahead.
I'll watch him.

620
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:43,772
Come on.

621
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:48,777
Look, I just can't sit around
in the apartment anymore.

622
00:32:48,811 --> 00:32:50,412
I feel like
I have to do something.

623
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,631
I understand.

624
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:54,633
I knew you wouldn't go.

625
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,396
You want some aspirin?

626
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:15,203
Hey.
Turn it off.

627
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:21,276
Tell me exactly
what your mother said.

628
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,279
I'm not allowed
to watch TV for a week.

629
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:28,917
<i>Man has no understanding.</i>

630
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:32,887
He can be taught a few
simple tricks, nothing more.

631
00:33:32,922 --> 00:33:35,190
<i>I'm afraid I must disagree.</i>

632
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,825
<i>According to</i>
<i>my experiments--</i>

633
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:40,495
Dr. Zira,
I must caution you.

634
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:44,566
I guess your stomach
is feeling better.

635
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:48,970
Why are you being punished?

636
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,839
I don't know.

637
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,574
Come on.

638
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:54,909
Because the wallpaper
didn't line up.

639
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,212
<i>...the simian nature</i>
<i>from a study of man</i>

640
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,280
is sheer nonsense,

641
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,583
because man is a nuisance.

642
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:05,720
<i>He eats up his food supplies</i>
<i>in the forest...</i>

643
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:08,840
You maniacs!

644
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:11,309
You blew it up!

645
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:14,562
Oh, damn you!

646
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:19,234
God damn you all to hell!

647
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:46,428
The humans blew up New York?

648
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:48,396
All of America.

649
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:51,249
So he came back to here?

650
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
In the future.

651
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:57,172
Jesus.

652
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:01,809
You want to see it again?

653
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:03,411
Can we?

654
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:15,123
I need another half hour.

655
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,391
Oh, yeah.
Just a minute.

656
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,596
It's for you.
It's the real estate agent.

657
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,768
- Hello, Ginny.
- Well, we didn't get it.

658
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,504
Wh-- what happened?

659
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,206
Someone came in
a little bit higher.

660
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,041
But you know what?
It wasn't meant to be.

661
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:35,160
How much higher?

662
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,796
It was still under asking, Peggy.
It wasn't meant to be.

663
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,548
There's no other way to think about it.
Try, try again.

664
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:50,525
Someone else got the apartment.

665
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:52,377
What are you gonna do?

666
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:59,100
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

667
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:01,002
That you give a damn.

668
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,404
Peggy, this is
an emotional story.

669
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:06,074
Stop being such a martyr. You're
having the time of your life.

670
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:08,977
- Why are you so mad?
- Because I'm alone in this.

671
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:11,546
That's not cool.

672
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,681
I don't mean financially.

673
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:16,251
I mean, don't you care
where we live?

674
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,820
Look, I don't feel right
expressing an opinion.

675
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,789
Now is your chance.

676
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:22,791
I don't want to live
on the Upper East Side.

677
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:25,827
Fine. Why?

678
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,428
I don't know.

679
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:29,230
I saw us raising
our kids in a place

680
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:30,765
with more different
kinds of people.

681
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:36,404
This photographer
trailing me the other night,

682
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,673
he lives in the West 80s.

683
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:40,074
Isn't it dangerous?

684
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:41,576
No, it's more rundown.

685
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,611
But that's why it's so cheap.

686
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:46,181
Get some lumber, a coat of paint--
people are doing it.

687
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,152
I didn't know
you felt that way.

688
00:37:09,638 --> 00:37:11,339
About the Upper East Side.

689
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,492
I do.

690
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:18,663
I'm sorry.

691
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,748
I just felt it wasn't my money.

692
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:22,467
How much of a say do I have?

693
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:27,755
You're in my life.

694
00:37:27,773 --> 00:37:29,791
You're a part of my life.

695
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,246
Peggy, I've got to finish this.

696
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,028
- Did you see this movie?
- Not yet.

697
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:10,999
Do you get to see it for free?

698
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,201
- I do.
- It's really good.

699
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:16,204
- We're seeing it again.
- You enjoy yourself.

700
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,125
Everybody likes to go to the
movies when they're sad.

701
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:51,305
I was looking for you.
You left the TV on.

702
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:53,524
I don't feel right
turning it off,

703
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:56,327
but I don't want to watch it.

704
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:58,496
He doesn't even want
me to come in.

705
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,814
Everything has settled down.

706
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,532
For the time being.

707
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,819
No, I think this
is the end of it.

708
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:08,156
Good.

709
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,591
Betty, I hope you know you'll
never have to worry about money.

710
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:13,027
Why would you bring that up?

711
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:15,029
Nothing.

712
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,731
I just keep asking myself,

713
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,900
- "What am I doing?"
- About what?

714
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:22,170
I keep thinking about
walking through Harlem,

715
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:25,807
Lindsay a few paces ahead,
grinning like he always does,

716
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:28,142
the rest of us
following behind.

717
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:31,079
- Wasn't that frightening?
- It was exhilarating.

718
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:33,481
But what was the cost
of avoiding that riot?

719
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:36,517
Police corruption,
disrespect for authority,

720
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:38,369
negotiating with hoodlums.

721
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:40,204
You can't say that
to the mayor.

722
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,723
He's never been more popular.

723
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:44,325
It's just, Betty,

724
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:46,678
I keep thinking I would
do it differently.

725
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,715
I want to do it differently.

726
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,818
And, well, they approached me

727
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,187
like they always do
when somebody dies

728
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:58,740
and they offered me a seat
in the state senate.

729
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,528
Do you want to run?

730
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,381
Run?
It's a Republican seat.

731
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:08,783
It's basically unopposed.

732
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,652
- You'd have to quit the mayor's office.
- He'll understand.

733
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:14,255
You think I'm the first guy
sick of being in a flank?

734
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,625
I feel like I've been asking you
to do this since I met you.

735
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,510
Well, I finally heard you.

736
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:22,330
It's a stepping stone
to state attorney general.

737
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:24,766
- And--
- And who knows what else?

738
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,434
Easy, partner.

739
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,603
This is what
I've wanted for you.

740
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,204
Us.

741
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,540
I can't wait
for people to meet you.

742
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:36,077
You know?
Really meet you.

743
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,135
Everyone's in bed.

744
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,604
Gene finally
climbed in with Sally.

745
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:06,361
I felt better, but now I don't.

746
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:12,250
- Why?
- Because who knows what you're feeling?

747
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:13,985
I didn't know
what to say to her

748
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,620
except, "I'd tell you
to ask your father,

749
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:17,789
but he's at the movies."

750
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:20,008
I should have said,
"He's just drunk."

751
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,377
You're better with them.

752
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:26,765
You don't understand.

753
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,334
I do.

754
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,836
You don't have Marx,
you've got a bottle.

755
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,526
Is this what you really
want to be to them

756
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,611
when they need you?

757
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:41,530
No.

758
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,906
I don't think I ever wanted to
be the man who loves children.

759
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:58,363
But from the moment
they're born...

760
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,801
that baby comes out

761
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:05,537
and you act proud and excited

762
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:09,341
and hand out cigars...

763
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:15,514
but you don't feel anything.

764
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,572
Especially if you had
a difficult childhood.

765
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:31,613
You want to love them,
but you don't.

766
00:42:33,232 --> 00:42:35,250
And the fact that you're...

767
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:40,038
faking that feeling

768
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:41,706
makes you wonder

769
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,209
if your own father
had the same problem.

770
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:52,801
Then one day they get older...

771
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:58,557
and you see them
do something...

772
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,761
and you feel...

773
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,450
that feeling

774
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:10,935
that you were
pretending to have.

775
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:20,462
And it feels like your
heart is going to explode.

776
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,144
That was faster
than I expected.

777
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:56,915
Are the things calmer out there?

778
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,322
Well, then...

779
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,424
have a good night.

780
00:45:02,715 --> 00:45:05,100
Hey.

781
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,153
- You need to go to sleep.
- I can't.

782
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:22,233
So why can't you sleep?

783
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:26,104
I'm scared.

784
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:28,807
Don't make me sorry for
taking you to the movies.

785
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:30,609
No.

786
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:32,477
I just keep thinking...

787
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:37,749
what if somebody shoots Henry?

788
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,726
No one's gonna do that.

789
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,629
- But they could.
- But they won't.

790
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:53,965
Henry's not that important.

791
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:01,790
Go to sleep.

792
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:45,654
