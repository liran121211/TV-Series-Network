I'm a head of accounts, damn it!

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,135
What's gotten into you?

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,896
You're supposed to be
calming me down.

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,321
- Ted, I've got cancer.
- What?

9
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:15,592
You gotta call Ted.

10
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:19,336
<i>They wanted our ideas
and a big agency,</i>

11
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,827
so we gave them both.

12
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,328
We merged.

13
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,772
We have to be careful.

14
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,640
We can't fall in love.

First day of school.
You nervous?

00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,428
What do you think?

36
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,796
It seems silly to ask, but do
you know where you're going?

37
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,099
I'll just follow you.

38
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:20,435
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey!

39
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,004
Stan, Ginsberg, Ted Chaough.

40
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,042
This is Margie. Margie, Peggy.
Margie, Ted.

41
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,809
It's nice to put
faces with names.

42
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,578
I saw you taking your
little tour the other week

43
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:31,913
and you looked pretty tall.

44
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,614
But now I see
you're about my height.

45
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:36,150
I hope you can still
look up to me.

46
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:39,219
- That was quick.
- Pleasure, Margie.

47
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,621
I've heard a lot about you.
We're all very excited.

48
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,527
Nice knowing you.

49
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,700
John Mathis.

50
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,902
You're in the second office
from reception.

51
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,738
Your secretary will be Connie.

52
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:03,809
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

53
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,545
Excuse me, Joan.

54
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,679
Are all the creatives
in one office?

55
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:11,483
- It's temporary.
- Well, it's going to be very crowded.

56
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,252
But that may change soon.

57
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:17,689
I know where all
the bodies are buried.

58
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,559
- I need a copy of that.
- They're just notes.

59
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,259
I need a copy
for Mr. Chaough.

60
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,994
He's not going
to change anything,

61
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:25,596
but he's going to be angry
if I don't know what it is.

62
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,231
Good morning, Moira.

63
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,033
- Joan.
- Good morning.

64
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,936
- Well, hello there.
- Hello.

65
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,805
I'm sorry they didn't
have your office ready yet.

66
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,207
I'll make do.

67
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,708
You know what, Moira?

68
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:39,509
I'll take care of Miss Olson.

69
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,578
Hopefully you can read
my handwriting.

70
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:45,381
We're putting you
in Harry's old office.

71
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,917
- Oh.
- But you don't have to share it.

72
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,685
As long as I don't
have to share Phyllis.

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,721
- ( gasps )
- Are you okay?

74
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,889
I don't know.

75
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:56,925
It could be moving boxes
or it could be I slept funny.

76
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,028
Are you still in there?

77
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,464
Yes, everything keeps
changing out here,

78
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,666
but everything's
the same in there.

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,101
Except you're a partner.

80
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,403

He's the man in my life.

83
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,579
- How's yours?
- Oh, he's good.

84
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:20,414
We bought a building
together to live in.

85
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,983

of the personnel changes.

101
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,380

Can you see if there's
another chair?

108
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,099

Yes, thank you.

Moira, take my chair.

Now that we've dispensed
with the gallantry,

00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:12,753
Jim Cutler and I have,
we believe, harvested

116
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:20,926
They want to be Ted
and Don's first love child.

117

That's new business.

118

Isn't there a section of this
meeting called good news?

119
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,767
I never would have taken you
for such a stickler.

120
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,603
Fleischmann's? Groovy.
We'll get right on it.

121
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:32,805
Regarding ongoing business,

122
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,974
the following is a list of current
accounts in ascending order.

123
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,976
That means smallest to largest,

Roger and I might
have to go to Germany.

129

But that's only because
we invited ourselves.

130
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,224
The New York State Thruway.

131
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:55,493
I just got off the phone

132
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,860
with Henry Lammott
at Mohawk Airlines--

133
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,262
Mohawk's on the next page.

134
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,230
This is related to the Thruway.

135
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:02,266
Henry Lammott
considers it a conflict,

136
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,635
<i>car travel and air travel</i>
<i>being mortal enemies.</i>

137
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,003
So when Burt Peterson gets ahold
of them, we should resign.

138
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,105
Did you tell Lammott
that was a stretch?

139
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,808
It's a $250,000 media budget.

140
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:13,343
Mohawk is an airline.

141
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:16,279
Except, Ted, the client
is New York State

142
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,214
and they gave us
their media buy up front.

143
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,650
- And you already spent it.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

144
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:24,486
Why didn't you tell us you lost Vicks
for yourself and Clearasil for us?

145
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:26,622
Why didn't you tell us
Frank Gleason was dying?

146
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,390
Frank's going to be fine.

147
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,659
I know Henry Lammott.

148
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,761
Pete and I will fly up there.

149
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,095
And Ted.

150
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,597
Of course.

151
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,065
What kind of plane do you have?

152
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,200
A Mohawk plane.

153
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,802
Ted's a pilot.

154
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,740
I'll take us up there.

155
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,742
We can land
right outside his office.

156
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,614
- Even better.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

157
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,449
Mr. Campbell, there's an
urgent phone call for you.

158
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,952
However we're going,

159
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,521
I recommend we go up tomorrow.

160
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,428
What's the next client?

161
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:11,263
Um, Koss Headphones.

162
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,733
Jim: <i>Burt Peterson
and Ken Cosgrove.</i>

163
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:17,035
<i>They sent Burt Peterson</i>
<i>a case of champagne.</i>

164
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:19,805
Billy?

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,274
Mr. Campbell,
I didn't want to trouble you,

166
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,309
but she was--

167
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:26,845
she's right here.
You want to talk to her?

168
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,346
What happened exactly?

169
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,648
Well, she was banging
on the door pretty hard,

170
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,283
saying she needed
to see your father.

171
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,352
<i>I thought somebody</i>
<i>was gonna call a cop.</i>

172
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:35,787
May I speak with her?

173
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,258
Bill, you've been so decent,
I hate to ask you another favor,

174
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,593
but could you get her
a G and T with two ice cubes?

175
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:45,195
- Gin and tonic?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

176
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,266
I don't know what's going on,

177
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,369
but I found this address
on my nightstand

178
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,438
in some woman's handwriting

179
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,073
and I assumed your father
was up to his old tricks.

180
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,275
Mother, he passed away.

181
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,411
You'd like that.
No.

182
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,513
He hasn't been home
for over a week

183
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:06,048
and his golf clubs
are still at the house.

184
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,550
( ice cracks )

185
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,118
Mother, you sound confused.

186
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,653
What are you implying?

187
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,655
I want you to relax,
watch the television,

188
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,356
and I will call Bud
to come and get you.

189
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:16,825
He's going to send
that girl Trudy.

190
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,027
Bud's wife is Judy, not Trudy.

191
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:22,196
Now I suppose I'm crazy
for mixing those up.

192
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,899
Tell Billy you're fine
on your own.

193
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,467
I am.

194
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,771
( sighs )

195
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,581
Hello there.

196
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,983
Nice to see you, Peggy.

197
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,485
Burt.

198
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,820
We're a long way
from Sterling Cooper.

199
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:49,288
Looks like the worm has turned.

200
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,625
Well, it's nice to have
the old team back together.

201
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,361
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
- Do you want me to get that?

202
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,232
Hello.

203
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,302
Oh, I was expecting
a secretary.

204
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,104
There isn't one
on the line, is there?

205
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,306
Hold on.

206
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,542
I've got to take this.

207
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,310
Well, we'll have plenty
of time to catch up

208
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,878
on those flights to Detroit.

209
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,586
He's still a cold fish.

210
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,690
Hello.

211
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,193
Come over here now.

212
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,094
I can't.

213
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,463
I have too much
going on in the office.

214
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,231
I need you

215
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,534
and nothing else will do.

216
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,006
Oh.

217
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,142
So?

218
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,114
12:30 at
the Sherry-Netherland.

219
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,483
Call me with a room number.

220
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,056
Come on in, Burt.

221
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,192
Have a seat.

222
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:07,062
What is this, a bed?

223
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:08,964
Yeah, you might want
to lie down

224
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,099
because here we are again.

225
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:14,570
Well, I haven't
forgotten anything.

226
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,572
Not a damn thing.

227
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:18,840
A lot of times in life
you get to do something

228
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,509
and you don't realize
until it's over

229
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,244
how much you enjoyed it.

230
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,212
And you swear that the
next time it comes around,

231
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,081
you're gonna remember that.

232
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,549
You're right.

233
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,217
And I think I can
work with you, too.

234
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:31,153
Work?

235
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,754
No, Burt, I'm letting
you go again.

236
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,823
What the hell?
You-- you can't do that.

237
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:40,694
Probably doesn't make a difference at
this point, but no one fought for you.

238
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:44,265
Well, we'll see what the folks
at Chevy have to say about this.

239
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,100
Remember Ken Cosgrove?

240
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:48,969
Like a six-foot version
of Alan Ladd?

241
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,970
He's touring
the plant right now.

242
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,373
You bastard.

243
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,442
I've got four million
in billings.

244
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:57,877
- What have you got?
- I was thinking you would feel that way.

245
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,813
That you had more clients
and that gives you a voice.

246
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,250
I was imagining you talking
over me in meetings.

247
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,351
Now I don't have that problem.

248
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,387
My clients will leave with me.

249
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:11,290
( chuckles ) No one will ever
say you weren't funny, Burt.

250
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,058
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

251
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,859
I'm expecting some kind
of severance.

252
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,828
Who knows?
We're really hurting.

253
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,997
We're having to cut back.
Well, obviously.

254
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,799
God, you're a real prick,
you know that?

255
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,167
Damn it, Burt,
you stole my good-bye.

256
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,645
Oh, hello.
You must be Burt Peterson.

257
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,414
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm supposed to report to you.

258
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,316
Well, as a first order
of business,

259
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,451
I recommend that you stick
your head between your legs

260
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,086
and kiss your ass good-bye.

261
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,891
What did you say to me?

262
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,227
Come see me.

263
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,862
No.

264
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:32,666
I need you

265
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,834
and nothing else will do.

266
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,882
You worked on the Daisy?

267
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,252
No, I worked on the KKK spot.

268
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,120
You probably heard about it.
It was too hot to run.

269
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,056
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

270
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,257
I mean, you made it 15 minutes
before you brought it up.

271
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:00,559
( chuckles )

272
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,427
I just spoke with Dawn.

273
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,196
Black or white?

274
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,030
She wouldn't tell me anything.

275
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,832
She's an excellent secretary.

276
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,134
I'm sure he can catch up.

277
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,004
So, before we inundate ourselves
with Fleischmann's unique benefits

278
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,973
and previous work,
I want to, I don't know,

279
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,443
have a little rap session
about margarine in general.

280
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:23,347
You mean like in terms
of the prospect?

281
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,416
Just whatever's on your mind.
Free-associate.

282
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:29,919
- ( whispers )
- My grandmother.

283
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,554
Yeah.

284
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,155
Yellow.

285
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,591
Yes.

286
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,991
Greasy.

287
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,427
It's not butter.
It's cheap.

288
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,794
It has no smell.

289
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,463
Yeah, man.
Keep going.

290
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,864
People hate it.

291
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,399
Hold on a second.
Who hates margarine?

292
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,967
You said there were
no wrong answers.

293
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,469
- I didn't say that.
- I don't hate it.

294
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,707
It was invented
for Napoleon III

295
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,909
because armies need to move
and it never spoiled.

296
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,645
That's fantastic.

297
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,979
How did you know that?

298
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,482
I don't know, I just did.

299
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,250
Let's get down
10 uses for margarine.

300
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,093
French army is number one.

301
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,221
And of course I was upset

302
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,390
because I was waiting
for Mitchell to call.

303
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,759
Then Arnie tells me
to cut the apron strings.

304
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,327
All of France is on fire.

305
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,296
I don't even know
if the phones are working.

306
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,597
There's no room for me to worry
about anyone but Arnold,

307
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:19,098
not even our son.

308
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,469
You can talk about your kid,

309
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,337
but I don't want to hear
about your husband.

310
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,072
I can talk about
whatever I want.

311
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,508
Can you help me look
for my shoes while you do it?

312
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,677
You want me to look
for your shoes?

313
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,316
I want you to crawl on your hands
and knees until you find them.

314
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,184
( scoffs )

315
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,520
They're right over there.

316
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,456
Do it.

317
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:18,021
I want you to get undressed,

318
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,956
then get back into bed.

319
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,852
Come over here.

320
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,027
( key jangles )

321
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,996
Don't go anywhere.

322
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,127
I'm hearing a lot about bread.

323
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,864
It spreads easy
because it's soft.

324
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,600
Really melts into the--

325
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,903
What did he just say?

326
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,006
Don.
There you are.

327
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,375
Sorry about that.
I got held up.

328
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,121
Let's not push too hard today.

329
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,489
- What'd I miss?
- We got some good ideas,

330
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,558
and I think we're ready for
a more traditional approach--

331
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:01,062
research, et cetera--
later in the week.

332
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,797
Great.
Peggy, you set the meeting.

333
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:15,108
What was that?

334
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:17,010
What? You called
the meeting to a close.

335
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,578
You also had it without me.

336
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,680
If the meeting's at 1:00,
the meeting's at 1:00.

337
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,682
Don, five minutes,
10 minutes--

338
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,651
I've been working in creative
my whole life, it's fine.

339
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,419
40 minutes?
Come on.

340
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,020
I've got better things to do,

341
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,423
but obviously you did, too.

342
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,176
( ringing )

343
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:56,880
Hello.

344
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,716
Are you still in bed?

345
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,618
Are you on your way?

346
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:05,422
You're going to wait there

347
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:07,857
and you're not going to know
when I'm coming back.

348
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,827
What's gotten into you?

349
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,063
Don't answer the phone again.

350
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:38,185
( ringing )

351
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,808
<i>( intercom buzzes )</i>

352
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:04,778
- Yes?
- Moira: <i>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

353
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,747
Send him in.

354
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,353
- Am I bothering you?
- What is that?

355
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:16,689
An olive branch.

356
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,894
I was just thinking
that it's probably best

357
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:24,029
if we talk about
margarine by ourselves.

358
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,472
Sorry, I don't know
what you drink.

359
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,973
Whatever there is.

360
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,310
Of course, everything
is packed away.

361
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,412
I would have opened that first.

362
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:41,945
Might have clients coming in.

363
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,180
I have something better
for the clients.

364
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,515
I have this bar cart
wheeled in.

365
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,783
How is that better?

366
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,384
You should see the girl
who wheels it in.

367
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,019
It's quite a presentation.

368
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,021
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to drink.

369
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:04,300
So, you want to show me
your notes from the meeting?

370
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:07,704
It took 40 minutes to figure out
no one knows shit about margarine.

371
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,772
( chuckles )

372
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,040
May I?

373
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,875
Is this gonna be Detroit again?

374
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,509
You're gonna lie down
on the couch while I pace?

375
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,045
I'll lie down after
we have our next one.

376
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,648
Let's get something
on paper first.

377
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,357
- Where is she?
- Well, she spent 25 minutes

378
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:32,292
looking for a dish for the nuts and
then she went into the bathroom.

379
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,462
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

380
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,797
She's using the ladies' room.
She's been doing it for years.

381
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,199
- No, take her home.
- My home?

382
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:41,869
- That's not an option.
- That is the only option.

383
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,504
Do you have any idea
what's going on in my office?

384
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,005
We're in the middle
of a merger,

385
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,406
in case you didn't get
past the sports section.

386
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,575
I'm supposed to suddenly
care after you went

387
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,610
to White Weld to underwrite
your public offering?

388
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,579
I caught a shovelful
for that, Pete.

389
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,882
I got to pretend to my partners
that you don't believe in nepotism.

390
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,017
I apologize that you didn't
get on that sinking ship.

391
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,852
You just ride out this merger,

392
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,521
and in six months
I'm your first call.

393
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,023
You don't understand. I went
to a meeting this morning

394
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:07,226
- and there was no chair for me.
- You're as high-strung as her.

395
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,896
First you don't have a chair,
then you don't have any clients.

396
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,598
- Mother, it's time to go.
- Don't do that yet.

397
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,333
Just get
your thoughts together.

398
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:16,635
- You have a long drive home.
- She has an apartment.

399
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,937
Even the cleaning woman quit.

400
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:22,007
Mother's cut all ties. The whole
place smells like a rabbit warren.

401
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,309
Judy and I have taken our turn.
Now it's yours.

402
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,511
No, that is not going to work.
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

403
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,447
( sighs ) Judy is
finished with her.

404
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,418
They got in a dispute about
Earl Grey or Major Grey

405
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,320
and Mother snapped her with a
tea towel across the face.

406
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,789
She should be locked up.

407
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,157
Maybe we can get
the paperwork started.

408
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,260
In the meantime,
buy Trudy a catcher's mask

409
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,763
and be happy that you get
to go to work every day.

410
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,306
I know why he's late
for everything.

411
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,408
Because we've put up with it.

412
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:02,245
I mean, honestly, is Peter
any busier than you are?

413
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,580
Mother, I'm Peter.

414
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,549
Do you want to go
to the Colony?

415
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,182
That's a splendid idea.

416
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,151
No, I have some soup.

417
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:11,887
Just take me home.

418
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:14,222
You're spending the night here.
You can have the bed.

419
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:15,991
I never sleep.

420
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,494
And you should be well rested.

421
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,529
Could you freshen this?

422
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:25,132
So Blue Bonnet
is the girl in pigtails?

423
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,068
Mary Ann.

424
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,070
"Gilligan's Island"
always works.

425
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,372
Every brand is represented.

426
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,776
So Fleischmann's is
the Marilyn Monroe redhead?

427
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,044
I don't know who's Ginger.

428
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,812
Probably Parkay.

429
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,547
Then you've got
Thurston Howell--

430
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,382
Imperial with the crown.

431
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,651
I think the one that's wide
open is the Professor.

432
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:46,987
Facts and figures,
health benefits.

433
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,355
Some kind of formula.

434
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:49,756
They're all made differently,

435
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,191
even if it's just location.

436
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:53,026
No, I find it interesting

437
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,495
that you've broken this down
into a formula.

438
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,485
There's a lot of bridges
to Manhattan.

439
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,433
You don't have any tricks for
when you're stuck other than...

440
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,102
<i>Are we stuck already?</i>

441
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:05,705
Let's take the competition
to a broader level.

442
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,441
Let's say there are more margarines
than characters on your TV show.

443
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,175
They all have
something in common.

444
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,677
They all want off the island.

445
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,913
No, they're all not butter.

446
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:17,782
- No one prefers margarine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

447
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,584
I have to eat something.

448
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,753
Doesn't ice count?

449
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,922
I'd settle for some more toast.

450
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:25,724
Ahem.

451
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,628
( sighs )

452
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,596
It's morning.

453
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,133
We know because we see
the rooster crow.

454
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:39,770
A farmer's wife sets pancakes
on the kitchen table.

455
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,539
She puts a pat
of margarine on top.

456
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:46,175
Then sets the dish down next
to the yellowest fried eggs,

457
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,977
a loaf of homemade bread,

458
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:51,014
<i>and a beading pitcher</i>
<i>of heavy cream.</i>

459
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:53,883
Syrup pours.

460
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:58,287
A smile comes over
their Dorothea Lange faces.

461
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,956
Two things-- cows

462
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,724
because she's a dairy
farmer's wife,

463
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,325
and I want bacon.

464
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,494
It's not up for debate.

465
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,001
<i>( knocking )</i>

466
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:21,318
_

467
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:45,731
<i>( knocks )</i>
Joan: <i>Just a minute.</i>

468
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,235
I said just a minute.

469
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,237
I thought you said come in.

470
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:54,672
I got everyone's paperwork.
I just wanted to drop them off.

471
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,441
You look a little wan.

472
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,143
I think I have food poisoning.

473
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,877
Do you want some ice water?

474
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:02,380
Oh! God...

475
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,284
Do you have your appendix?

476
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,453
- It's the other side.
- You can't stay here.

477
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,522
And I can't leave, either.

478
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:19,363
Just walk with me and I'll
bother you all the way out.

479
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,732
No one will know.

480
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:32,308
So I get the laxative
people into the booth

481
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,844
and I record three
or four spots at one time.

482
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,046
Who talked Topaz
into television?

483
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,549
I did, but then
Margie took it over.

484
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,083
The client still
calls me Peggy.

485
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:44,153
Everybody, everybody.

486
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,787
I'm taking a survey.

487
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:49,491
It's Eugene McCarthy
versus Bobby Kennedy.

488
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,426
How many for Kennedy?

489
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,595
Show of hands.

490
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,997
But Humphrey
has all the delegates.

491
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,365
I'm voting for Nixon.

492
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,300
Oh, I knew it, Mathis.

493
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,769
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

494
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:04,438
Don't you have any hope?

495
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,341
I'm for Bobby.

496
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,511
Well, I... Ted?

497
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,480
You okay?

498
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,950
Why don't you call it a day?

499
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:20,620
Come on.

500
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,190
- What about him?
- Let him sleep it off.

501
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,662
Ted, come on.

502
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,763
I'm fine.

503
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,603
<i>( man coughing )</i>

504
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:41,738
<i>( woman talking over PA )</i>

505
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,513
Drink that.

506
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,983
- Is that urine?
- It's the pipes.

507
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,951
The babysitter's
agreed to stay,

508
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:58,954
but no word from your
mother, so I'm not leaving.

509
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,389
She's probably still
in the Catskills.

510
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,358
Remember Rip Van Winkle?

511
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,892
You like that story?

512
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:07,028
I know it.
I could tell it to you.

513
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,831
No, you should go.

514
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,267
Who knows what 20 years
will do to this place.

515
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,702
I have no place to go.

516
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:21,275
What's gonna happen to Kevin?

517
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,910
He'll either end up
with my mother

518
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,879
or Greg's parents.

519
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,748
It's just food poisoning.

520
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,416
( groans )

521
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,119
No, that's not what it is.

522
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:35,221
Come on.
Let's go.

523
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,789
I've got you.

524
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:47,200
Excuse me,
Nurse... Finnegan.

525
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,801
I see how busy you are, but
can I trouble you a moment?

526
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:52,037
Doctors will see you
the moment they can.

527
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:53,805
No, it's not about that.

528
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,542
It's just, well,
I'm such a fool

529
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,743
and I suppose I was
trying to be a gentleman,

530
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,446
- but my friend here, she--
- Don't.

531
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,915
We don't need to see a doctor.

532
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,285
I'm sure it's something that would be
covered by your medical expertise.

533
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,420
What are you talking about?

534
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,222
She's a little embarrassed,

535
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:13,491
but she drank furniture polish.

536
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,293
Honey, why'd you do that?

537
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,429
She wasn't wearing her glasses.

538
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:21,198
You do need to see a doctor.
Why didn't you tell me that?

539
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,799
I'm sorry. I really
never know what to do.

540
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,267
I thought I'd just
leave it up to you.

541
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:27,070
Okay, sweetheart.
Ramirez.

542
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,106
Take her to bed four.

543
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,209
<i>( woman speaking over PA )</i>

544
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:35,111
She'll be fine.

545

<i>( lock clicking )</i>

546
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,531
You look perfect.

547
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:59,166
Well, I had three hours
to get ready.

548
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,236
I don't know if the shoes go.

549
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,803
They do.

550
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,609
Where are we going?

551
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,978
We're not going anywhere.

552
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,747
Are you kidding me?

553
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,450
Why would you think
you're going anywhere?

554
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,785
You are for me.

555
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,356
You exist in this room
for my pleasure.

556
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,425
Are we going to eat?

557
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,561
Don't ask any more questions.

558
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,062
Take off your dress.

559
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,833
Take off everything for me.

560
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,133
Like that?

561
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,326
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

562
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:50,304
I think you look
worse than I do.

563
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,575
Well, I slept on
the floor of my office.

564
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:56,276
They didn't give you a couch?

565
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,213
I couldn't find it.
Draper knocked me out.

566
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,314
Not literally.

567
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,984
I'm sure there's
a lot of work to do.

568
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,953
It's got nothing
to do with work.

569
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:09,722
He seems more interested in me
than he is in the work.

570
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:11,890
But you're not
very interesting.

571
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:14,727
He doesn't know that.

572
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:17,295
What's he like?

573
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,033
He's mysterious.

574
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,235
But I can't tell
if he's putting it on.

575
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:27,605
He doesn't talk
for long stretches,

576
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,307
and then he's
incredibly eloquent.

577
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:32,910
He's very successful.

578
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:35,680
You didn't think
he was charmless, did you?

579
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,715
You learned to work with me.

580
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,283
And look at you.

581
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,420
If I wait patiently
by the river,

582
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,922
the body of my enemy
will float by.

583
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:49,125
( sighs )
Such a waste of energy.

584
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,596
Give him the early rounds.
He'll tire himself out.

585
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,334
Go home, shower,

586
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,737
walk back in there
like you own half the place.

587
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:22,257
I'll be back at dinnertime.

588
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,825
Because you live here.

589
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,294
No, I don't.

590
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:26,895
There's a hamper
full of laundry

591
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,629
and a razor in the sink.

592
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:30,264
Is Trudy finished with you?

593
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,799
This is our pied-à-terre.

594
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,734
Does your father
bring prostitutes here

595
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:35,202
or is it just for yours?

596
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:36,770
I want to be taken home.

597
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:39,340
Your apartment's
been overrun with vermin.

598
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:40,975
They're spraying all day.

599
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,144
Oh.

600
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:46,112
I didn't remember that.
I want to get my things.

601
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:49,782
It's raining very hard out
and it's, well--

602
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:51,717
it's St. Patrick's Day.

603
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:54,354
- It's May.
- No, it's not.

604
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:57,690
And who knows what's out there?

605
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:03,728
I'll have the cook make
your favorite for dinner.

606
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,101
<i>( door closes )</i>

607
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:27,557
- Morning.
- You look fresh.

608

Where's my secretary?

609
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:31,593
Or is this how
they do it at CGC,

610
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,495
just let yourself in?

611
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,964
I didn't want to wait out there

612
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,967
because this whole visit
is confidential.

613
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,802
You want to quit already?

614
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,073
When you told me
about the merger,

615
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:46,308
I hoped he would
rub off on you,

616
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,409
not the other way around.

617
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,912
He's getting
everything he wants

618
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:53,381
and obviously
you're on his side.

619
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:55,684
Why did you do it at all
if there are sides?

620
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,318
You could have just tried
to hire me back.

621
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,853
You never even
asked me to lunch.

622
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,923
Yes, Peggy, we risked
our entire company

623
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:05,258
just so I could have you in
this office complaining again.

624
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:07,494
Well, he can't drink like you.

625
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:08,996
And you must know that
because nobody can.

626
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,464
- Peggy, he's a grown man.
- So are you.

627
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,001
Move forward.

Kenny in Detroit, everything's
going to fall in your in-box.

What about Cutler?

632
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,513
What about every time
there's a change around here,

633
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,182
I get knocked down
to a worse office?

Mr. Campbell,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

636
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,220
but you're needed on the phone.

637
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:36,822
What now, Clara?

638
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,525
Is she injured?

639
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,327
No, but there's been a fire.

640
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,830
( sighs ) Call Henry at Mohawk.
See if he can meet tomorrow.

641
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,165

this will take.

I just don't want
to think about anything.

Who told you
you were allowed to think?

So, what do I do now?

649
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:21,265
You fall asleep

00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,533
I'm flying upstate,

651
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:28,237
and when I come back,
I want you ready for me.

I can do that

Mr. Campbell had an emergency
and Mr. Draper is out,

660
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,909
so I wanted to make sure you
knew that we were rescheduling

661
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,444
this afternoon's
meeting with Mohawk.

662
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,011
Absolutely not.

663
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:13,513
What the hell
is going on around here?

665
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,983
I am, but apparently Pete
Campbell wants to move it.

666
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,419
We can't cancel
the meeting to show a client

667
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:22,354
how important he is.
When can he go?

668
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:23,989
It doesn't matter. We should
go up there right away.

669
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,591
It's raining pretty hard.
We can wait a couple hours.

670
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:30,462
Don't worry about that. Once we're above
the clouds, it's sunny as summer.

How long have you
been doing this?

673

Not now.

674
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:54,351
There we go.

675
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,753
You can relax now.
We're leveled off.

676
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,523
I am relaxed.

677
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,862
( rattles )

678
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:08,464
Sometimes when you're flying,

679
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,033
you think you're right side up,
but you're really upside down.

680
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:14,337
Really?

681
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,339
Got to watch your instruments.

682
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,850
You don't want to take in
the wonder of God's majesty?

683
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:32,053
I like to read on planes.
I don't like to talk.

684
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,821
But you're gonna talk
to Henry Lammott.

685
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,857
I mean, you're the one
that knows him.

686
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:38,292
Does it matter?

687
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:40,127
No matter what I say,

688
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:42,863
you're the guy who flew us
up here in his own plane.

689
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,833
I guess that's true.

690
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,441
I don't know if Joanie's awake.

691
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,110
I really don't need to see her.

692
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,078
You can just give
Kevin my gift.

693
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,950
Oh. Oh.

694
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:07,353
( chuckles ) Hello.

695
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,422
I really wasn't planning
on dropping in.

696
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,926
I just wanted to see
if you were feeling better.

697
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,262
The hospital wouldn't tell me anything
because I'm not immediate family.

698
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:19,097
He's two years old.
He'll play with the bow.

- Sit down. Have a snack.

No, that's all. Don't want to be
away from the office too long.

701
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:26,437
Although I left
my overcoat on my chair,

702
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:28,906
so they know I'm there.

703
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:32,944
Well, it's nice meeting you.

704
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:41,085
He's adorable.

705
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,186
He's too young.

706
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,055
I can tell you from experience

707
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,857
that younger men are not
intimidated by powerful women.

708
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:51,194
- He's not interested.
- He saved your life.

709
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,529
It was just a cyst on my ovary.

710
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,899
I would have been fine.
He's worrying about his job.

711
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,301
Well, why wouldn't he?

712
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,403
It doesn't take away
what he did.

713
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:03,638
Honestly, Joan, every good deed

714
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:05,607
is not part of a plan.

715
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:13,315
She left the teakettle on.
It was mostly smoke.

716
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,416
Can you get Henry Lammott
on the phone?

717
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,322
I will, but Mr. Lammott
already called for you.

718
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,924
Don and Ted thought
it was best not to wait.

719
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,760
Really?
They went without me?

720
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:29,930
Yes. Apparently it
went very well.

721
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,565
Damn it, Clara.
They went without me.

722
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,968
Therefore, it did not
go very well.

723
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:38,638
You do understand that your
employment here is tied to me?

724
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,307
And if things
happen without me,

725
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:42,342
they'll eventually
happen without you.

726
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,480
Don't feel bad that you were
taking care of your mother.

727
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,515
My mother can go to hell.

728
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:51,517
Ted Chaough can fly her there.

729
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,286
Do you want me to get
Mr. Lammott on the phone?

730
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:57,456
Can you give me a minute?

731
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,627
<i>( door closes )</i>

732
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,101
I'm here.

733
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,239
Where are you going?

734
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,308
I think it's time to go home.

735
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:22,744
Not yet.

736
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:25,346
I think this is over.

737
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,050
It's over when I say it's over.

738
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:37,124
I had a dream that you
crashed in that plane.

739
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,494
But I'm back.

740
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,063
I dreamt I went to your funeral

741
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:44,765
and Megan cried on my shoulder.

742
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,901
- Stop it.
- And then I went back to Arnold

743
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:52,171
and I made love to him
and I said,

744
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:55,941
"I've been away,
but I'm home."

745
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:58,744
It means you missed me.

746
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:02,581
No.

747
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:09,420
It means it's time
to really go home.

748
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,059
This is over,

749
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:16,094
and not just this.

750
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,107
It's easy to give up something
when you're satisfied.

751
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,744
It's easy to give up something

752
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,579
when you're ashamed.

753
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,286
Please.

754
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:58,433
Let's go.

755
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:34,868
Burt Peterson's gone.
That leaves me,

756
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:37,036
Jim Torkelson,
and Lawrence Harris.

757
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,172
You've got Roger, Pete,
Ken, and Bob Benson.

758
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:42,507
But you've got your creatives
Peggy, Cecil, and Beanie.

759
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,476
We lost Margie, Koch,
and Steve Hagan.

760
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,812
I don't know who Peggy
counts for, but we need Bob.

761
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:50,248
Bob's got to go.
Last hired, first fired.

762
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:57,889
Very well.

763
00:43:57,923 --> 00:44:00,892
But before I cross him off,
let me remind you

764
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:03,060
that Bob has been very
involved in Ken's accounts,

765
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,128
and with Ken servicing Detroit,

766
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,629
I don't know how long it'll
take Lawrence to catch up.

767
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:08,865
Fine, Lawrence is gone.
Are we done here?

768
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,370
The secretarial staff?

769
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:16,572
<i>( elevator humming )</i>

770
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:31,520
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

771
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,206
And instead of being afraid,

772
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,775
I realized I should just ask
for a couple of weeks off.

773
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,946
They write people out
all the time.

774
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,014
Or I could shoot in advance

775
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,383
and maybe we could go
to Honolulu again.

776
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,819
<i>This time without business.</i>

777
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:08,787
I just thought it would
be fun to go on a trip,

778
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:11,423
the two of us for a bit
without the kids.

779
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,293
( voice fades out )

780
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:29,140
Peter.

781
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,276
They shot
that poor Kennedy boy.

782
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,144
That was years ago, Mother.

783
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:35,513
I just saw it
on the television.

784
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:38,449
( sighs )
It's 6:00 AM.

785
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:40,684
You'll be late for school.

786
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:42,452
Please just let me sleep.

787
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:45,555
I don't understand
what's going on.

788
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,657
They're shooting everybody.

789
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:51,795
