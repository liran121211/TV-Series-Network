1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,501
Daddy, don't.

2
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:25,536
It's 10:30.
why aren't you asleep?

3
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:27,668
- i'm afraid.
- sally.

4
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,204
I know. you're not thomas edison.

5
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:29,775
I know.

6
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,479
What are
you afraid of?

7
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,541
I'm afraid of what's
going to happen

8
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:38,692
When you turn off
the lights.

9
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,307
I'm home now.

10
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,475
Nothing can hurt you...

11
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,411
Except maybe this mess.

12
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,049
Pick up your room and
i'll get you a night light.

13
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,783
Okay.

14
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,384
Go to sleep.

15
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,334
- what did you find out?
- nothing.

16
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,192
I bet they're gonna make
us work over the holiday.

17
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,926
And cosgrove's late.

18
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,193
- can we have everyone's attention, please?
- shh. shh.

19
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:24,934
- can we have everyone's

20
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,719
<i>this will
only take a moment</i>

21
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,919
<i>and it will not
be repeated.</i>

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,320
That's not true,
mr. hooker.

23
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,731
We've just
been informed

24
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,766
That there will be a visit from the
director and chairman of the board

25
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,577
<i>of putnam,
powell & lowe,</i>

26
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,814
The purpose of which
is both friendly

27
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:47,283
And of course
to evaluate our performance.

28
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:51,604
- mr. hooker. - the visit
will commence tomorrow-

29
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,439
That is tuesday-
at 10:00

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,873
And will continue
into the next day.

31
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,941
We apologize. we realize
we were to be closed

32
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:01,212
<i>- wednesday july 3rd, but-
- man: oh, come on.</i>

33
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:06,468
They were unaware
of the holiday.

34
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,275
Now we merely need

35
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:13,247
That everyone continue to operate
at the height of their productivity

36
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:16,508
And to make sure that
their desks and offices

37
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,183
Are shipshape
and bristol fashion.

38
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:23,085
<i>and by no means should
these preparations interfere</i>

39
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:23,585
With our work today.
very good then.

40
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,036
With our work today.

41
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,110
Don, may we have a word?

42
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,157
Well, isn't this perfect?

43
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,726
Well, we'll just move it from
lunch to the end of the day.

44
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,461
I'm having
a cake delivered.

45
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,762
- how's that going to look?
- a cake for what?

46
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,663
Tomorrow is joan's last
day. i told you that.

47
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,931
But if we're working on wednesday,
wouldn't that be her last day?

48
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,631
I don't know
why she'd come in.

49
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:58,265
Greg finds out about his
residency today or tomorrow-

50
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,366
I'm not sure. i think they're
going away to celebrate.

51
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,501
I'm going to get some money.
we should buy her something.

52
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,952
Umm, harry and pete,

53
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,609
We will need presentations
for wednesday morning

54
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,970
On the state
of television

55
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,971
And, of course,
account updates.

56
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,106
- just a few minutes each.
- on each account?

57
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:16,273
No, a few minutes
for each of you.

58
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:17,374
And mr. kinsey,

59
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,274
<i>you might want
to shave your beard.</i>

60
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:20,808
What?! who the hell
are you people?!

61
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,199
What?! who the hell

62
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:24,953
That was a joke.

63
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,012
There's no need
for panic.

64
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:35,148
Just think of this as the
same as any major client visit.

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,015
They're flying across the ocean
to have their knobs polished?

66
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,526
4th of july-
subtle.

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,317
Get the door,
will you?

68
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,948
The british are coming.

69
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,624
I assume you know

70
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,323
I have a theory. i believe
they're coming to see you.

71
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:58,757
- why?
- they've shown a great deal of interest in you.

72
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,458
Ever since you
swung around your privates

73
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,192
In the boardroom
with duck last year.

74
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,326
<i>bert: they study
and dissect your work,</i>

75
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,427
Trying to decipher

76
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,194
<i>what is your particular
american genius.</i>

77
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,895
What is your particular

78
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,762
What do you think it is?
the presidency?

79
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,723
No, i think it'll be
a creative umbrella

80
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,249
With a dual position

81
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,277
- london?
- bye-bye, don.

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,790
How congenial
you two are.

83
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,837
I hope you can maintain this
pretense when they arrive.

84
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,108
- excuse me?
- kiss and make up

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,372
Before you cost us
all something.

86
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,806
Before you cost us

87
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:37,940
You're being
melodramatic.

88
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,861
You're being

89
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,708
Miss blankenship,

90
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:41,475
Please make
an appointment at angelo's

91
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,286
Please make

92
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,284
For mr. sterling
and draper,

93
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,979
- the soonest available.
- i have my own barber.

94
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,320
- that's not necessary.
- enough!

95
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,657
Everyone wants
martin & lewis-

96
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,349
Reconcile.

97
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:03,114
Damn it!

98
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,883
It's done!
john deere is done.

99
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,960
The 110 lawn
and garden tractor

100
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,192
With snow thrower,
transparent vinyl enclosure

101
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:22,993
And a key.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,900
Look at him. he just
brought in a mastodon.

103
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,629
Sorry i'm late.

104
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:34,364
Big accounts move slowly,
but the john deere doesn't.

105
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,825
Listen, mr. clampett.

106
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,797
You might want to get your
iron horse out of reception.

107
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,248
I will...
after everybody sees it.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
- no, p.p.l. is coming.
- when?

109
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,501
- tomorrow morning.
- and we have to work wednesday.

110
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:49,702
- we have to give presentations.
- you got that one just in time.

111
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,203
Yeah, i guess i did.

112
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,905
- she's in here!
- shh shh.

113
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:06,310
I'm resting and your little
brother's sleeping.

114
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,871
All he does is sleep.

115
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,569
What are you doing?

116
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:11,913
I'm bored.

117
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,947
Go bang your head
against a wall.

118
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,638
- mom!
- only boring people are bored.

119
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,539
Can i pet him?

120
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,567
Don't wake him.

121
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,286
Come over here.

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,253
Go play.

123
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,471
You can sleep all you want,
little pig in a blanket.

124
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,458
<i>roger: that is
quite a shave.</i>

125
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,526
<i>roger: that is</i>

126
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,628
I'm thinking about
my toes right now.

127
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,599
- go to town.
- he's next.

128
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,198
- i already had one.
- see, that's not true.

129
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,265
You think there's
something feminine about it?

130
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,956
My father was
the tallest, handsomest,

131
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:07,755
Vainest man in new york,
and he got his nails done.

132
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,503
<i>whoo!</i>

133
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:10,836
- whoo!

134
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,904
He had his fourth coronary
behind the wheel

135
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,405
And then hit a tree.

136
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,615
Windshield severed his arm

137
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,040
And he was dead,
so they never put it back on.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,361
In the casket,
he had one hand-

139
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,439
The nails were perfect.

140
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,976
I don't believe
that story.

141
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:30,167
Okay, so he hit
another car and not a tree.

142
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,534
It's my company.
why should i be nervous?

143
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,198
Because you sold it.

144
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,115
So that's it?
that's what i did to you?

145
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,750
I got you half of a million
dollars? i'm really sorry about that.

146
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,021
- no one said
you did anything.

147
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,446
You sound
like burl ives.

148
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,771
Part of the problem
with mona

149
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:59,323
Is that one day she just
started judging people.

150
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:00,990
Never gave
a crap before.

151
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,191
I'll tell you
right now, don,

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,930
I don't like
being judged.

153
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:07,993
Listen, roger-

154
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,251
I'm okay. i'm okay.

155
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,630
We don't need to talk
about this anymore.

156
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,830
I promise.

157
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,398
I was holding out
for gratitude,

158
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
But i'll take that.

159
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:23,451
Thank you.

160
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:29,882
Well, maybe now you'll have
the money and the glory.

161
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,704
Call the photographers,
type service and vendors

162
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,172
And tell them all deliveries
should come between 9:30 and 11:00

163
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,606
So the british can see lots
of activity when they arrive.

164
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:39,473
Now.

165
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,374
Are you being
short with me

166
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,175
Because you think
it'll make parting easier?

167
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,242
My mother used
to do that.

168
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,476
My mother used

169
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,476
I'm noticing
for the first time

170
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,110
That the ladies out here
are rather plain,

171
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,844
Present company exuded.

172
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:54,112
Well, we could hire
some prostitutes.

173
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:57,080
I know your prime minister
enjoys their company.

174
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,591
The secretary of war,

175
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,715
And you'd do best not
to bring that up tomorrow.

176
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,849
- i apologize.
- well, i apologize

177
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,550
That tomorrow's visit will
steal from your spotlight.

178
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,318
Perhaps we can reschedule your
surprise party till after the holiday?

179
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,879
Why did
you do that?

180
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:10,984
Do what?

181
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,087
Mrs. harris knows everything.
i'm sure she was expecting it.

182
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,621
Mrs. harris knows

183
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:19,656
I'm going to go home and make a
celebratory dinner for my husband.

184
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:22,490
And when you wake up
in the middle of the night

185
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,571
And wonder what you
forgot, don't call me.

186
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:39,114
- well, that's smooth.
- i got a shave.

187
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,432
- why?
- they ordered me to do it.

188
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,667
We have an inspection
tomorrow- the british.

189
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,888
Well, you look
very successful.

190
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,089
Hot or cold?

191
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,163
Swedish meatballs
or chicken salad?

192
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,028
Chicken salad.

193
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,072
Did you pick up
a nightlight?

194
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,383
I did, and i read her to sleep.

195
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,275
She was still clingy.

196
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:07,142
I don't remember her being that
resentful when bobby was born.

197
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,043
I don't know
that she resents him.

198
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,184
Well, she won't
go near him.

199
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:12,177
She won't even go in his
room unless i make her.

200
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,268
She won't even

201
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,417
- why are they visiting?
- we don't know.

202
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,709
Delayed everybody's
vacation plans.

203
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,593
He was perfect today.

204
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,069
- who?
- gene.

205
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,444
Would you ever want
to live in london?

206
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:38,975
I'm serious.

207
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,540
Of course.

208
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,378
I could get a pram
and a real nanny.

209
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,996
What do you know?

210
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,192
Nothing.

211
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:15,237
Where the hell
were you?

212
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:19,205
I told you- i was going
for drinks with the docs.

213
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,839
You didn't tell me anything.
you didn't call me.

214
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,460
I called you
at work.

215
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,108
That's a lie.

216
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,146
I just ate
dinner for two.

217
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:31,351
Get over here.

218
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,140
I know
you're drunk.

219
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,341
Come sit
next to me.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,740
So what happened?

221
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:55,618
I, uh...

222
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:00,549
I didn't get it.

223
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,058
What happened?

224
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,661
It doesn't say
anything except

225
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:16,996
That they made doug
hutchinson chief resident.

226
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,837
And i felt the floor
open up under me.

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,966
So you'll get it
next year.

228
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,827
You knew
it was possible.

229
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:32,202
I ran into eddinger

230
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,903
About a half hour
before the letter came.

231
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,294
I could tell
something was wrong.

232
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,941
He wouldn't
look me in the eye.

233
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,599
I figured he felt bad

234
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:46,557
And that i'd at least find
out what the hell happened.

235
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,943
But he didn't feel bad.

236
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,981
What are you talking
about? he loves you.

237
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,513
He sat me down
in his office,

238
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,140
He poured a drink
and he said-

239
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:14,193
He said i had
no brains in my fingers.

240
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,556
But he wrote you all
those nice evaluations.

241
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:26,047
Damn it, joan! doctors don't
write bad things about each other.

242
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:32,727
- so you'll go to another hospital.
- not in new york.

243
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:34,461
If i want
to stay in surgery,

244
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,902
I can go to alabama
or something.

245
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:50,961
So what happens?

246
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,553
You're still
a doctor, right?

247
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,371
I am.

248
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,827
Just not a surgeon,

249
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,898
And i will never
be a surgeon.

250
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,308
- did they fire you?
- i don't want to talk about it, joanie, okay?

251
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,759
- did they fire you?

252
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,694
I was hoping
you were asleep.

253
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,202
I have another year
of residency.

254
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,571
You're not gonna be able
to leave your job.

255
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,382
Greg, that's done.

256
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,019
Well, get another one.

257
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:27,743
Honey.

258
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:36,874
Listen.

259
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,129
You are still
a doctor.

260
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,783
I married you for your
heart, not your hands.

261
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,196
They all went out
to celebrate.

262
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,214
I couldn't do it.

263
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,975
I just couldn't do it.
i couldn't fake it.

264
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,030
I've been sitting in the
dublin house since 2:00.

265
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,259
Go lay down.
i'll undress you.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,090
Just let me close
the light.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,568
Mr. hooker, you neglected to tell
me that our guests have arrived.

268
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:47,669
- to what do i owe the pleasure?
- this is mrs. harris.

269
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,403
She was the office manager before me,

270
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,372
But she is off
to greener pastures.

271
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:55,233
- well, that's a shame. guy mackendrick.
- joan harris.

272
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:57,516
This is
mr. harold ford

273
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,611
- and you recall saint john powell.
- we've spoken on the phone.

274
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,212
I believe that's true.
i just wanted to tell you

275
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,514
I made a reservation
at la grenouille at 6:00

276
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:09,716
And got you two tickets to
"oliver." it's a wonderful show.

277
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,518
I've heard that
- a tragedy with a happy ending.

278
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,252
My favorite kind.

279
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,169
Thank you, joan. shall i
give you the threepenny tour?

280
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,892
<i>- please let everyone
know that they're here.</i>

281
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,559
We have you
scheduled to meet

282
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,728
With sterling, cooper and
draper and then with mr. pryce.

283
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,496
<i>- then a light lunch
in the conference room</i>

284
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,330
With the personnel
you requested.

285
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,621
Tomorrow, the presentations
and client meetings.

286
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,635
- saint john, good to see you again.
- peter campbell.

287
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:43,435
- this is guy mackendrick.
- i know everything about you.

288
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,936
You're a very
impressive fellow.

289
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,617
I wish i could
return the compliment.

290
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,169
Well, perhaps
one day you shall.

291
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,711
Good morning,
gentlemen.

292
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,344
Hello.

293
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,922
Miss olson,
one of our copywriters.

294
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,081
I know everything about you. you
are a very impressive young woman.

295
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,122
Why thank you.

296
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,750
I was just
writing copy.

297
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,541
- as you were.
- i hope we chat later.

298
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,189
Mr. draper is waiting for
you in mr. cooper's office.

299
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,880
This way.

300
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,850
That is
a very handsome man.

301
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,850
- good to see all of you.
- it's a pleasure.

302
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,036
Don. no worse
for wear, i see.

303
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,571
What a delightful custom.
from the far east i assume?

304
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,672
- japan.
- how was your trip?

305
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,640
Gentlemen, i'd like you
to meet harold ford

306
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,175
And this young man is
guy mackendrick.

307
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,510
Mr. cooper.

308
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,245
- mr. sterling, what an honor.
- call me roger.

309
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:59,976
- and you must be don draper.
- i am.

310
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:02,415
I can't tell you how exciting
it is to finally meet you.

311
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,046
That's very flattering.

312
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,151
Guy here has done
a study of your work

313
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,751
And that's quite
a compliment.

314
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,987
You see, in addition
to his inestimable charm,

315
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,655
Guy here has degrees
from cambridge university

316
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,122
And the london school
of economics.

317
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,990
Three years at the bank,
two years at mccann

318
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,558
And his most recent coup-
mercedes benz.

319
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,327
- that's very impressive.
- i apologize.

320
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,962
I didn't realize
he was going to recite

321
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,095
<i>my entire
curriculum vitae.</i>

322
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:25,786
My entire

323
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:28,834
You left out "modest."

324
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,432
Well, we're going
to debrief mr. pryce

325
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,499
And the plan is for you
to join us for luncheon.

326
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,701
In the conference
room at 1:00.

327
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,692
Sounds like
agatha christie.

328
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,904
Well, apparently
our tour continues.

329
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:43,505
I look forward to- how
do you say? - catching up.

330
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,939
I as well.

331
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,772
Well, that was strange.

332
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,593
Look at that.

333
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,611
- the suspense is killing him.
- mmm.

334
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,550
<i>yes?</i>

335
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:13,239
Mr. powell and mr. ford
are here to see you.

336
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,345
- spectacles.
- oh, right.

337
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,029
Send them in.

338
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:27,699
Gentlemen.

339
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,146
Greetings,
saint john.

340
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,550
Harold,
what a pleasure.

341
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:35,402
Please see to it that guy
has a space to prepare.

342
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,069
- right away.
- gentlemen.

343
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,870
There's coffee
and cake.

344
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:49,257
We're very
impressed, lane.

345
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:51,942
Very very impressed
indeed.

346
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,481
In nine months, you've
trimmed every bit of excess,

347
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:59,483
Increased billings and we
haven't heard a word of complaint.

348
00:20:59,484 --> 00:20:59,983
<i>yes, well,
pax romana and all that.</i>

349
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:00,734
Yes, well,

350
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,686
Bravo. we've decided
to offer you something

351
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:08,421
That we hope you'll view
as a reward and a challenge.

352
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,742
Is it in the box?

353
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,490
In a manner
of speaking.

354
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:15,825
<i>open it.</i>

355
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:24,761
Ooh! what is that?

356
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,179
It looks like
a snake.

357
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:29,745
Fancy that.

358
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,455
Is it real?
- it was.

359
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,141
It's for
our snake charmer.

360
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,309
It's for

361
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,376
We're sending you
to bombay.

362
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:45,897
Bombay?

363
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:48,965
What would i do there?

364
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:52,936
Well, hopefully the same
thing you accomplished here.

365
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:57,634
Uh, umm...

366
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,792
Where shall
i put this?

367
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,025
I guess i needn't
find a spot for it

368
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:16,061
- if i'm simply moving again.
- don't pout.

369
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,562
One of your greatest qualities
is you always do as you're told.

370
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:22,233
No, it's just the logistics
- my wife just settled,

371
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,400
My son just accepted to
school and now we're moving on.

372
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,381
Nonsense.
you're moving up.

373
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:35,285
- mmm.
- that's the spirit.

374
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,378
So without further ado,

375
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,447
I will give the floor
to guy mackendrick.

376
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,478
Let me begin by offering
my warmest wishes

377
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,150
And admiration for lane
pryce and his exemplary work.

378
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,985
It'll be hard
to lose him,

379
00:22:56,986 --> 00:23:00,756
But there's no doubt that
our loss is india's gain.

380
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,860
Now let me say there's
no cause for anxiety.

381
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,062
There will be no further
reductions in the ranks.

382
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,623
Yes, that's good news

383
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:23,705
If i might, i'd like to walk you
through this slight reorganization.

384
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,804
<i>as before, p.p.l. london
will be the head of this body</i>

385
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,505
And sterling cooper,
now more than ever,

386
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,240
Our american presence;

387
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:37,527
<i>our business maturity
with your creative edge.</i>

388
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,193
A triumvirate of don,
myself and mr. cooper,

389
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:42,765
Our chairman emeritus,

390
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:46,014
Will oversee three
streamlined departments:

391
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,585
Creative art and copy,

392
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:51,716
Account management-
that's mr. cosgrove

393
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,617
<i>and mr. campbell
for the present-</i>

394
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:55,252
And a combined
television media department

395
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:56,703
Headed by mr. crane.

396
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:01,348
Mr. sterling's not
on that chart at all.

397
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,524
That's true.

398
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,922
Oh. well, that was
an oversight.

399
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,661
As you can see, nothing
much has really changed.

400
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:15,530
Frankly, my presence here is just
to ensure thorough communication,

401
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:18,832
That we help each other
on both sides of the pond

402
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,923
Whether it be a sharing
of creative genius,

403
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,107
Media savvy,

404
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:30,098
Or the unbridled acquisition
of new business.

405
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:33,347
I'm sure you all have
1,000 questions.

406
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:37,510
But for the time being
i say we inform the troops

407
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,412
So that the transition can begin
immediately after the holiday.

408
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,546
Shall i have
mr. hooker prepare a memo?

409
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,714
No. nonsense. i don't want
this to be the kind of place

410
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,681
Where such news is
delivered that way.

411
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,372
Shall we?

412
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:58,751
Gosh, we're really
going to miss you.

413
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,827
- what the hell just happened?
- they reorganized us

414
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:10,295
And you're the only one in
this room who got a promotion.

415
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,996
- really?
- yes, really.

416
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,670
I apologize
for my wild imagination.

417
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,300
That's not what i want
to talk to you about.

418
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,131
What's this?

419
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:47,387
It's for you.

420
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,032
"for my new big sister,
the best in the world."

421
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,763
And my goodness,
it's from baby gene.

422
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,599
Look.

423
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:09,042
Baby gene can't write.

424
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,790
Tsk. babies get
fairies to do things.

425
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:13,301
You know that.

426
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,263
It's really from him.
i'm not kidding.

427
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,294
I think
you should open it.

428
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,965
<i>- what is it?
- it's a barbie.</i>

429
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,075
I think
he wants you to know

430
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,456
That he wants
to be your friend.

431
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,638
And you are
very important to me too.

432
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm sure you all have
1,000 questions,

433
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:27,515
But before i raise a glass
to sterling cooper's future,

434
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:30,136
I should like
to recognize its past,

435
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,367
Most recently,
the inspired stewardship

436
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,786
- of lane pryce.
- hear hear!

437
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:42,062
I'm also aware of a rather
significant milestone.

438
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:45,127
Mrs. harris,

439
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:48,105
From those who have
known you only hours

440
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:51,230
To those who have cherished
your nearly 10 years of service,

441
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,561
I wish you caviar,

442
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:56,072
Children

443
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,980
And all that is good
in your new life.

444
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:04,742
Oh, there there.
that wasn't my intention.

445
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,366
Mrs. harris, please.

446
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,701
We'll have our
presentations tomorrow.

447
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,902
Let this afternoon be
a fete worthy of joan.

448
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,538
Enjoy the liquor
and delicatessen.

449
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:36,006
Thank you.

450
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,113
Thank you all.

451
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:40,001
This is completely
unnecessary.

452
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,241
You'll be
sorely missed.

453
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,802
We got you
the cake.

454
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,051
Well...

455
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,360
So what now? they keep
adding people above us.

456
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,501
One more promotion and we're
going to be answering phones.

457
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,180
We should
go say hi.

458
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,540
This is
good champagne.

459
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,758
I don't think so.

460
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:22,636
I'm going to get
something to eat.

461
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:36,358
<i>allison: mr. draper, conrad
hilton's office is on the line.</i>

462
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,228
- what?
- conrad hilton,

463
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,389
The hotel owner.

464
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:43,633
- yeah, i know what he does. why is he calling?
- i don't know.

465
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:47,534
- and he's calling for me?
- yes. well, his office is.

466
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,101
Put him through.

467
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,895
Donald draper.

468
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,747
<i>mr. draper,
this is miss wakeman.</i>

469
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,302
<i>mr. hilton has expressed
a desire to meet with you.</i>

470
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,860
May i ask what
this is regarding?

471
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:06,652
<i>i just set
his schedule.</i>

472
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:08,343
<i>when are
you available?</i>

473
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,323
<i>- how about right now?
- "right now. " please hold.</i>

474
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:13,894
- how about right now?

475
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:20,548
<i>how far are you
from the waldorf astoria?</i>

476
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,108
15 minutes.

477
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:25,017
<i>it's the presidential suite.</i>

478
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,996
I'm on my way.

479
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,780
Mmm. where's
miss blankenship?

480
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:45,451
She's down there
saluting union jack.

481
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:46,935
What is that?

482
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:48,844
Chocolate pudding.

483
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,014
I wasn't even
on the chart.

484
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:56,445
My name's
on the wall out there.

485
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:58,895
- you want some?
- no.

486
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:03,973
I like to think, "i'm rich.
they can't hurt me."

487
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:07,125
That's a mistake.

488
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:12,635
I'm being punished
for making my job look easy.

489
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:16,395
Although
- that kid guy, he has a spark.

490
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,479
He is
a pure account man.

491
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,210
And what is
that job all about?

492
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,784
I don't know. it's about
listening to people

493
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,072
And never saying what's
really on your mind.

494
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:31,453
No. it's about
letting things go

495
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:33,794
So you can get
what you want.

496
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,782
Have a nice holiday.
enjoy the fireworks.

497
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,530
We took their money.

498
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,637
We have to do
what they say.

499
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,167
My dad keeps talking
about vietnam.

500
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,334
Like he wants me
to get drafted.

501
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,469
First of all, they're
hardly drafting anybody.

502
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,730
Second of all,
you're too old.

503
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,005
Third of all,

504
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:13,239
I have a friend
in the army,

505
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,306
And if you're smart,
you're set.

506
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,974
He sits behind
a desk at fort dix

507
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:18,841
And screws
secretaries all day.

508
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,762
Does he shoot
the peoples?

509
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:23,947
I don't know. i've gotta take a piss.

510
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,763
- joan.
- yes?

511
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:33,234
- may i speak with you?
- thank you.

512
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,499
I just
- i wanted to get you a card or a present.

513
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:43,218
It'd be nice if i gave
you a gift for once

514
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,319
And you didn't wonder
if i wanted something.

515
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,660
Knock yourself out.

516
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,978
I don't want you to think
i never listen to you.

517
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:54,357
It's just-
we can't all be you.

518
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,738
Be that as it may,

519
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:59,392
I do take some credit
for your success here.

520
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,021
Hey, put that back.

521
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,598
I'm going home!

522
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,550
I can't believe
i'm going to miss this!

523
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:27,205
I'm really happy that
you got what you wanted.

524
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,816
I remember
on my first day you said

525
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,973
That could happen to me
if i played my cards right.

526
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:33,964
Are you getting
sentimental?

527
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:36,566
Oh! oh my god.

528
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:42,545
Don't worry. i'm sure we'll
see each other all the time.

529
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,146
- if we don't,
i just have to say-

530
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,814
Oh, for the love
of christ!

531
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:56,819
Oh my god.

532
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,396
- oh, my foot!
- call an ambulance!

533
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
- holy crap!
- jesus!

534
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:09,323
There's a tourniquet
in the first aid kit.

535
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,884
You're gonna be okay.

536
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:12,649
Dear god.

537
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:17,097
I can't feel
a thing.

538
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,345
Oh, god!
what did i do?!

539
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:20,995
<i>get her out of here!</i>

540
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,616
- get her out of here!

541
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,808
- the ambulance
is on its way.

542
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,671
- i'm donald draper.
- we've met before.

543
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:42,872
We have,
haven't we?

544
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,573
Yellow rock
country club.

545
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,544
We had a drink.
of course.

546
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:50,085
You fixed it for me.
let me return the favor.

547
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:52,709
I can't believe
you're conrad hilton.

548
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,677
Connie.

549
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:55,911
Don.

550
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,412
Food?

551
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,013
Best kitchen in the world-
got a salad named after it.

552
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:04,094
I'm fine. i really
should have known that.

553
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,599
I don't know.
now, uh...

554
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,367
After this comes out

555
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,369
Next week-

556
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:17,076
Well, they don't
do that for everyone.

557
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:22,363
I think i look
like an arab.

558
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,524
How did
you find me?

559
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:27,558
I called around, told
people i had a long chat

560
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,960
With a handsome fella
from sterling cooper

561
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,560
And your name
never came up.

562
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,428
Apparently you don't have
long chats with people.

563
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:35,639
Well, here i am.

564
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:38,126
What can
i do for you?

565
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,095
What do you think?

566
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,301
I think you wouldn't be in the
presidential suite right now

567
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:51,042
If you worked
for free.

568
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,000
Don, this is
friendly.

569
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:57,334
Connie, this is my profession.
what do you want me to do?

570
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,900
I want you
to give me one for free.

571
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:20,544
I don't think anybody wants to
think about a mouse in a hotel.

572
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:33,701
Well, that was my idea.

573
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,606
You got something better?

574
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:38,223
I might.

575
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,492
So...

576
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,830
What do you want?

577
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:52,388
I'm not gonna lie
- i'd love a chance at your business.

578
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,430
Okay...

579
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:58,698
But the next time
somebody like me asks you

580
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,209
A question like that,

581
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,827
You need
to think bigger.

582
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:06,966
Well, connie,

583
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,705
There are snakes that
go months without eating

584
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:14,373
And then they finally
catch something,

585
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:15,934
But they're so hungry

586
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:19,261
That they suffocate
while they're eating.

587
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,397
One opportunity
at a time.

588
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,118
Sorry to interrupt.

589
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,979
Mr. draper, you have
an emergency call.

590
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,947
Home or office?

591
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,915
Do you understand
what's happened here?

592
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,382
- that we're not to be trusted?
- she's an idiot.

593
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:38,783
- i didn't know she couldn't drive.
- you took the machine out.

594
00:37:38,784 --> 00:37:40,384
You have to have respect
for that equipment.

595
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,251
It's very safe
when operated correctly.

596
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,352
We had the world handed
to us on a plate,

597
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,120
And then you swing in
on a chandelier,

598
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:46,387
<i>drop your pants
and crap on it.</i>

599
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:47,954
Drop your pants

600
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:50,656
Jesus, it's like
iwo jima out there.

601
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:53,490
We should put a rubber mat
down so cooper can get around.

602
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:54,757
They're changing
the carpeting.

603
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:55,448
Any news?

604
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,325
He might lose
his foot.

605
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,883
Right when he got it
in the door.

606
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:04,599
Oh god.

607
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,396
Sit down, sissy mary.
you're pale.

608
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,395
I take
full responsibility.

609
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,999
Believe me,
somewhere in this business,

610
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,810
This has
happened before.

611
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,375
Happened before.

612
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,980
Joan- my god.

613
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:37,519
I know.
it's ruined.

614
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,112
- how is he?
- i didn't expect you to come over.

615
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:41,443
I just thought
you should know.

616
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,071
Honestly, when i called you,
i thought he might die.

617
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,833
- but he's not going to?
- mmm.

618
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,624
No. he's lost
the foot.

619
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,139
Jesus.
that's awful.

620
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:53,218
Lane went to retrieve
powe and ford from dinner.

621
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:55,899
They've already talked
to the doctor.

622
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,440
I'll wait.

623
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,893
Despite
the circus today,

624
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:16,070
I hope you know that you are
going to be terribly missed.

625
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,571
That's nice to hear,

626
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,342
Especially
from you, don.

627
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:36,169
I bet he felt great when
he woke up this morning.

628
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,022
I'm sure
you're right.

629
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:42,061
But that's life.

630
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,107
One minute you're
on top of the world,

631
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:50,008
The next minute some secretary is
running you over with a lawn mower.

632
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>lane: oh!</i>

633
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:58,696
- i'm heartbroken.
- it's a terrible tragedy.

634
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:01,039
One that surely
could have been avoided,

635
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,568
Although, mrs. harris, thank
you for your quick thinking.

636
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,329
- you may have saved his life.
- such as it is.

637
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,180
He was a great account man
- a prodigy.

638
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,948
He could talk a scotsman
out of a penny.

639
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:14,648
Now that's all over.

640
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,338
I don't know
if that's true.

641
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,234
The man is
missing a foot.

642
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:21,463
How is he going
to work? he can't walk.

643
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:23,891
The doctor said
he'll never golf again.

644
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:27,682
I'm afraid we have to
reevaluate our entire strategy.

645
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:31,275
Lane will remain
here indefinitely.

646
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:34,235
We'll close the office
tomorrow, obviously.

647
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,733
Mrs. harris,
please allow the company

648
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,229
To reimburse you
for that dress,

649
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,092
Just as a token
of our gratitude.

650
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:41,320
I think saint john and i
should see him if we can.

651
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,071
Of course.

652
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,326
You should get home
to that lucky husband.

653
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:54,759
Yes.

654
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,197
Huh.

655
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:23,115
Can i get you one?

656
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,561
Sure.

657
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:34,466
I've been reading a lot of
american literature lately.

658
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,854
- "tom sawyer."
- that's a good one.

659
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:44,852
I feel like i just went
to my own funeral.

660
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:47,945
I didn't like
the eulogy.

661
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:49,025
- hey. hey hey hey hey. hey hey.
- daddy!

662
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,575
<i>hey. i've got you.</i>

663
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,439
I've got you.
just breathe.

664
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,780
Shh.

665
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,660
Shh.

666
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:02,313
Get him out, daddy!

667
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:08,289
I don't even know
what to say.

668
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:12,672
Shh.

669
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:15,704
- daddy.
- shh.

670
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:22,875
Okay, calm down

671
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,083
And tell me
what's going on.

672
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:26,568
Grandpa gene-

673
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,661
He's not supposed
to be here anymore.

674
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:32,388
- he's not.
- he's called gene,

675
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,416
He sleeps in his room,
he looks just like him

676
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,046
And i bet when
he starts talking

677
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,657
He's gonna sound
just like him too.

678
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,712
He's a baby.
that's it.

679
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,211
I want you
to go to sleep.

680
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:51,733
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

681
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,308
Betts,
this has to stop.

682
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,348
There's nothing
i can do.

683
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,428
She's jealous
of her little brother.

684
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,524
No, she's not jealous.
she's scared,

685
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,020
And it's all because
he has that name.

686
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:22,581
"that name."
you've never liked it,

687
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:24,777
<i>you haven't hidden it well and
now you're bringing her into this.</i>

688
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,771
That's ridiculous.
let's talk about sally.

689
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:30,165
She's a child.
she'll get over it.

690
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,376
<i>now you have to.</i>

691
00:44:32,062 --> 00:44:34,290
He was my father
and that was his name.

692
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,201
It's what
people do, don.

693
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:39,013
It's how they keep
the memory alive.

694
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:41,154
He hated me
and i hated him.

695
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:44,292
- that's the memory.
- that's his name.

696
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:50,928
I'm really sorry.

697
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,440
I didn't mean
to wake him.

698
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,700
That's okay, honey.

699
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,988
Everything's fine.

700
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,229
Come on.
let's get you to sleep.

701
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:32,902
Come over here.

702
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:48,785
You see?
it's all right.

703
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,792
This is
your little brother

704
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:03,647
And he's only a baby.

705
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,351
We don't know
who he is yet,

706
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,357
Or who he's
going to be.

707
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,020
And that is
a wonderful thing.

708
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:25,686
Shh.

709
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:30,907
<i>â¶ yeah â¶</i>

710
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:33,352
<i>â¶ yeah â¶</i>
