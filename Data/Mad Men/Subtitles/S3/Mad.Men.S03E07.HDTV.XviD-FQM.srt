00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,759
Synchro: Hutch

2
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,090
Mad Men 3x07
- Seven Twenty Three -

3
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:37,963
What do you think?

4
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,573
Now it may take a moment
to get used to.

5
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:42,760
I told you...
men don't like change.

6
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,619
It's hard for me to judge
when I can't see a price tag.

7
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,854
A modern chinoiserie breakfront,

8
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:52,017
a dunbar japanese-influenced sofa,

9
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:54,076
silk dupioni drapes,

10
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:58,069
murano vases
and a classic drexel end table.

11
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,890
- And what goes here?
- Where?

12
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,020
Right where we're standing.

13
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:09,330
That's your hearth, darling.
That's the soul of your home.

14
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,900
People gather around a fire even
if there isn't one.

15
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:17,433
- So, Don?
- I think it's fine, Betts.

16
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,892
All you do all day at work is
evaluate objects.

17
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,825
I would like
the benefit of your eye.

18
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:30,527
Move the end table and the lamp
to the other end of the couch.

19
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:39,020
I think he's right.

20
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,082
- Hot as hell already.
- Yes, it is.

21
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,333
I watched the sunrise today...
I couldn't sleep.

22
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,145
- How was it?
- Average.

23
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:57,706
Ogilvy wrote a book.

24
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,268
I got the galleys.

25
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:01,949
They want a quote or something.

26
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,176
Advertising's already
up there with lawyers

27
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:06,767
as the most reviled.
This is not going to help.

28
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:09,744
It'll help him.

29
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,468
It's called
"confessions of an ad man."

30
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,518
- I like the title.
- Please.

31
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:16,958
It's a book everybody writes,
only he got it published.

32
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,332
It should be called
"1,000 reasons I'm so great."

33
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,769
- Is he publishing it himself?
- No, atheneum.

34
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,684
I'll send it over.
I don't want you to buy it.

35
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:28,142
And you know
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

36
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,323
There you are.

37
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:31,159
When do you want us
to move the meeting to?

38
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:32,261
Move it?

39
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:35,260
I'm 15 minutes late.
I told you I don't want them hovering.

40
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:37,234
If I'm late, send them away
and call them when I get here.

41
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,884
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is
in your office.

42
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,031
- Right now?
- He just walked right in.

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,874
We were waiting
and he blew right past us.

44
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:45,886
Hold on.

45
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,262
Come back in 20 minutes.

46
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,824
- Did you offer him coffee?
- I did. He's all set.

47
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,248
You look great.

48
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:53,833
20 minutes.

49
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,502
- You can take an hour if you need it.
- He wants to look busy.

50
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,948
Move it.

51
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,485
Allison, hold all my calls.

52
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,140
What a great way to start the day.

53
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,185
9:30? It's practically lunch.

54
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,805
Well, can I get you something?

55
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:18,137
I've got a personal matter

56
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:19,735
that's not fit for the phone.

57
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,413
What can I do for you?

58
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,795
I don't know
what I'm more disturbed by...

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,125
The fact that
you don't have a bible

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,542
or that there's not
a single family photo.

61
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,545
I'm easily distracted.

62
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,324
You should have those things.

63
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,762
They'll make you feel better
about what you do.

64
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,094
Start showing up on time.

65
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:49,306
Maybe I'm late because I was spending
time with my family reading the bible.

66
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,998
Are you nervous, Don?

67
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,887
I'm finding you hard to talk to.

68
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:58,648
You caught me by surprise.
I think you know that.

69
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,699
Now you're a married man,

70
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:10,825
so you'll have to use
your imagination, but...

71
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:13,776
I have this...

72
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,041
Involvement.

73
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:20,201
I can't say it's perfect
and my needs are being met,

74
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:23,074
but I have significant needs, Don.

75
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,092
Do you catch my drift?

76
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:33,050
So what do I do when my eye
starts to wander?

77
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:36,971
Don't you have a coterie

78
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,817
of trusted advisors, friends,

79
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,858
kings that might
counsel you better?

80
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,156
I want you to handle
the Waldorf Astoria,

81
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,365
the New York Hilton
and the Statler Hilton.

82
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,214
It's just New York,

83
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,162
but my eye has definitely
started to wander.

84
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,450
I think that's a good start.

85
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,702
Retainer, etcetera...

86
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,277
That's for lawyers.

87
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,506
Everything else will be like this.

88
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,893
Having me in your life is
gonna change things.

89
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,911
- I look forward to it.
- They always say that.

90
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:23,636
- A happy bunch.
- If you say so.

91
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,361
Young people give us energy.
Don't forget that.

92
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,477
I'll take it from here.

93
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,490
It's not much to start with, but I look
forward to sharing my dreams with you.

94
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:34,744
Speak to you soon.

95
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:48,841
I cannot believe
you just had a baby

96
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,513
and you redid your house.
Are you suicidal?

97
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,776
They were not supposed
to be simultaneous,

98
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:58,638
and the baby wasn't the one
that couldn't keep a schedule.

99
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,586
I assume this meeting
means you're interested

100
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:03,552
in replacing Francine as secretary?

101
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,483
I am.

102
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:08,238
Good, because we waited for you
for our most pressing business.

103
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,264
The proposed
3-million-gallon water tank

104
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,826
will not only drain the
Pleasantville road reservoir,

105
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,161
but also blemish the natural
and financial health of our community.

106
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,706
Well said.

107
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:23,180
The junior league needs to take over
this effort and explain the issues.

108
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:25,851
First: conservation...

109
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:27,963
The "Silent spring,"

110
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,008
the majestic beauty
of the Hudson river valley.

111
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:32,761
Second:

112
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,702
worthless real estate
on both sides of the river

113
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:39,309
because some industrial park
on route 9 needs our water.

114
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:43,167
We need to go over the village
board's head, appeal to the governor.

115
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,654
The Rockefellers own
half the land here.

116
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,078
Real estate...

117
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,353
That's scary.

118
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,489
I may know someone
in the governor's office.

119
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,417
Who?

120
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,578
His name is Henry.

121
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,142
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

122
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,099
Henry Francis.

123
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,388
He's in the paper sometimes,

124
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:07,086
always right behind rocky.

125
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:08,702
What does he do?

126
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:11,092
I'm not really sure.

127
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:12,888
How do you know him?

128
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,138
I met him at a party
for Don's work.

129
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,555
Here he is. Oh, my.

130
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,264
It just says "Advisor."

131
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,452
Yes, I know who he is.

132
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,313
He used to be

133
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,164
the republican party chair
for Westchester county.

134
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:28,844
I know him.

135
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:30,857
Call him then.

136
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,990
I think we have a better chance
if Betty calls.

137
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:39,847
It's not adorable to pretend like
you're not adorable.

138
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:42,371
Call him.

139
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:44,907
He's a big deal.

140
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:50,213
Miami is where we should start,
let it grow from there.

141
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:53,782
Ho-ho wants it everywhere.
He just bought land in Seattle.

142
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,158
It's an indoor city.

143
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,497
As long as he keeps writing checks.

144
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,438
Look, do you want to kill
this thing in one blow

145
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,432
or do you want to shear
the sheep every year?

146
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,436
Whatever you want, Don.

147
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,735
You made it clear you don't want
to talk about it,

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,135
but at least tell us
how you know him.

149
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:13,861
We ran into each other at a party.

150
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,348
That'll be all.

151
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,595
I know Roger will be
the face of this thing,

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,835
but I wouldn't mind
doing the legwork.

153
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,188
I think you're supposed to bring
in the account

154
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:34,164
and I'm supposed to be to be on it.

155
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,926
What happened with
North American Aviation?

156
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,594
It's going well,

157
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,471
my friend Russ who deals
with McNamara's office

158
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:43,472
said the orders are
through the roof

159
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:46,228
for helicopters, carbines
and especially jets for Vietnam.

160
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,020
I think I've convinced
North American

161
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,478
they're going to need to spend more
if they want to get out of Nasa

162
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,075
and into the Pentagon.

163
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,533
When they do,
we can talk about Hilton.

164
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,161
Understood.

165
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,436
No. Yes, of course. He's busy.

166
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,102
It's wilson-4-8-0-3-8.

167
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,536
He can call me anytime.

168
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,840
It's a civic matter
regarding ossining.

169
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:17,286
Thank you.

170
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:19,471
Lunch!

171
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,845
Wash your hands, Bobby.

172
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,314
Draper residence.

173
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,691
Mrs. Draper, it's Henry Francis.

174
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:36,034
Yes, of course.

175
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,759
I appreciate you getting back
to me so quickly.

176
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,073
Stop it.

177
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:44,329
Could you hold just a moment?
I'm going to get on the extension.

178
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,329
<i>Of course.</i>

179
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,955
I'm going in the study.
Hang up the phone.

180
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,474
Damn it!

181
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,660
- What is wrong with you?
- You said to hang up the phone.

182
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,638
Afteri pick up the phone.

183
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:06,723
Freeze.

184
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:11,923
Draper residence.

185
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,440
It's Henry again.
We were disconnected.

186
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,727
I'm sorry about that... my son.

187
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,539
I know how that goes.
How are you?

188
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,448
You must have had your baby by now.

189
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,965
Yes, I did.

190
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,413
You remembered.

191
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,497
- <i>What did you have?</i>
- A little boy.

192
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,040
Can you get him
registered by November?

193
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:35,503
I just realized everyone who
calls you must want something.

194
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,040
Actually, I've been doing most
of the calling lately.

195
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,466
What can I do for you?

196
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,667
We were hoping you could stop

197
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,012
the destruction of
the Pleasantville road reservoir.

198
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:48,100
- Who's "we"?
- <i>I'm representing the junior league</i>

199
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,456
of Tarrytown.

200
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,848
They want to build
a 3-million-gallon water tank

201
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,598
and it's a very scenic area.

202
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:55,912
<i>I know the area.</i>

203
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:58,109
It's practically
the governor's backyard.

204
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,973
That's true, but I grew up
there as well.

205
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,410
- <i>Really? Where?</i>
- Mount Salem.

206
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,764
I'm heading upstate
tomorrow afternoon.

207
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,744
Maybe I could stop by
and take a look.

208
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,660
Tomorrow is Saturday.

209
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,876
Of course. I work every day.
I forget other people don't.

210
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,025
This is very important to me.

211
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,135
I think I could find the time.

212
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,345
Is Swenson's bakery still there?

213
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,930
It is and it has
an air conditioner.

214
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,142
I'll buy you a cup of coffee and then
we can take a hike to the reservoir.

215
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,987
- <i>Is 3:00 too late for you?</i>
- No, it's perfect.

216
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,740
I'll make it work.

217
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,012
<i>I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.</i>

218
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:56,049
I can save you the trouble...
it's from him and it's expensive.

219
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,164
I'm going to fire her.

220
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,464
What did you promise him?

221
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,654
- Who?
- You're thick, do you know that?

222
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,550
That present... it's from Duck.

223
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,165
Hermes. Nice.

224
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,261
I hope yours is a different color.

225
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,912
"Elegance and success. Duck."

226
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,936
- I wonder who wrote that for him.
- I don't trust him.

227
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,424
Why? Because he wants us?

228
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:21,475
- We're very important here.
- Who is?

229
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,445
Did he put you on Hilton?

230
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,665
I don't know
what you're talking about.

231
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,658
Stop barging in here and infecting me
with your anxiety.

232
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,177
This is really beautiful.

233
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,482
He sent me a box of cuban cigars...

234
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,334
Although I'm starting to think
they're not that hard to come by.

235
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,712
Hilton hotels? Did we get that?

236
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,688
Do you live in a cave?

237
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,883
Hilton came to see Don this morning.
He was right there.

238
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,240
Really? What was he like?

239
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,053
I only got a quick look at him.
He was skinny, like a cowboy.

240
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,036
My mother gave me his book.

241
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:56,021
He's catholic.

242
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,563
It's going to be a huge account.

243
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,236
Not as big as Lucky Strike,

244
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,536
but it would be nice to be planning
a little offense for once

245
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,569
instead of hiding from the FTC.

246
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:07,561
- He has a book?
- I really like this.

247
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:11,451
Look, I'm keeping this.

248
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,915
Duck said we're not tied together.

249
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,789
I'll keep my mouth shut
and you do whatever you want.

250
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:20,834
Do you know why Duck doesn't
work here anymore?

251
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,629
Because Don squeezed him out
when the british took over.

252
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:24,861
So what?

253
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,497
Don didn't like him.

254
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,797
It's the world against Don
and now it's someone else.

255
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:31,011
True,

256
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,860
but Duck would love
to hit Don where it hurts.

257
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm not going anywhere
and I'm not going to tell Don.

258
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,384
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about Duck.

259
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,274
Send it back.

260
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,660
When were you going
to tell us about this?

261
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,822
I thought I'd let it be
an incoming phone call

262
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,207
and then wait and see
who took credit for it.

263
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,452
This is very exciting.

264
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,684
Despite its modest billings,

265
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,183
London is thrilled
with Hilton's potential

266
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,058
for international growth.

267
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,308
Finally.

268
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,284
Huzzah.

269
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,895
If you don't mind my asking,
how did you make this happen?

270
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,355
We travel in the same circles.

271
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,775
Well, I don't know

272
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,526
if we should celebrate yet.

273
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,154
His lawyers called

274
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,363
and there's a little
matter of the contract.

275
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,541
Well, don't be afraid to push back.

276
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,613
I agreed to the New York hotels,

277
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,579
but everything else should
be under our terms.

278
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,959
I don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

279
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,627
Or lack thereof.

280
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,692
It may seem like
a formality to you,

281
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,933
but to Mr. Hilton it's a necessity
that all the principals

282
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:53,708
in the firm be secured.

283
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,966
And honestly,

284
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:57,765
I can't blame him.

285
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:00,994
I'll give him my word.

286
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,612
And he'll take it,
but his lawyers won't.

287
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,312
Obviously, you'll want
your attorney to look it over.

288
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,287
That's Ben Michelson, hmm?

289
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,549
It's fairly standard...

290
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,584
Three years, a non-compete clause,
a healthy raise.

291
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,882
That's very generous.
I'll think about it.

292
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:34,647
I'm confused.

293
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:38,848
If someone handed me that contract,
I'd be filled with glee.

294
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,933
A three-year guarantee,

295
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,419
a $5,000 signing bonus...

296
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,064
I've never seen that before.

297
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:49,071
Well, we want to take care of him.

298
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,857
Look, I've gotten
to know Conrad Hilton

299
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:57,337
a little bit and I think he'll enjoy
something he can't have,

300
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:01,047
and you should tell him
that it matters to me.

301
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:02,800
It matters to him.

302
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:06,825
Still, I don't think anyone
told him that it matters to me.

303
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,925
This is the way it has to be

304
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,819
and not just for Conrad Hilton,
but for Sterling Cooper.

305
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:20,055
I'd like you to take those papers
home for the weekend

306
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,557
and think about that.

307
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,568
I'd be happy to.

308
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,396
I met him once. He's a bit
of an eccentric, isn't he?

309
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,575
Oh, Jesus.

310
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,792
I'm alone. I hope that's okay.

311
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,512
Well. Actually, my friend couldn't
get away either.

312
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:38,634
I appreciate your coming up.

313
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:42,180
Please. I love coming back here.
So much changes, so much doesn't.

314
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,199
Like what? I'm interested.

315
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:46,949
Can I help you?

316
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:50,514
- Just an ice tea, please.
- That's fine for now.

317
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,902
What was I saying?

318
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:01,236
You were talking about
coming back here.

319
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,596
Ossining has always been
a real mix of people.

320
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:07,326
After living in Manhattan,
it wasn't my first choice,

321
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:09,001
but it's grown on me.

322
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,959
I lived in Manhattan
when I was married.

323
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:15,505
It's okay for work, but I can't sleep
with all those people on top of me.

324
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,250
Like in a skyscraper.

325
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,890
May I have a straw?

326
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,598
So you have your folder.

327
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:28,764
I thought I'd just
give you the literature

328
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,639
and a copy of the petion.

329
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,105
I don't know that
I'm a great spokesman.

330
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:36,138
You don't have to tell me
how beautiful the reservoir is.

331
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:38,074
I used to do jackknives into it.

332
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,649
We drink that water.

333
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,535
I've looked into this for you
and I'm afraid its underway.

334
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:49,080
No. We're too late.

335
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,332
Maybe if you knew
somebody with some clout.

336
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,629
I don't even know what you do.

337
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,030
I'm a classic strategist, fundraiser,

338
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,724
maybe campaign manager.

339
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:03,010
I'm waiting on that.

340
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:05,839
And how do you become that?

341
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,724
- Give a lot of money?
- No.

342
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:10,615
No, I'm a lawyer,
but I don't use it much.

343
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,780
We all have skills we don't use.

344
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,330
I was an anthropology major.

345
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:17,441
Imagine that.

346
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:19,401
Where?

347
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,111
Bryn Mawr.

348
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,405
Well, you may be saving

349
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,494
I'm hungry. Do you mind?

350
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,904
- I don't know.
- Fine.

351
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:35,216
You can read from your folder
and watch me eat.

352
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,718
I'll have apple pie and...

353
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,589
Ice cream or cheddar cheese?

354
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,817
One of each.

355
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:47,179
Can we just get
one thing out of the way?

356
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,391
I don't know what I can do
about the water tank.

357
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,110
Don't give up so easily.

358
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:07,091
What this really is
is a camera obscura.

359
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,856
We call it a sun scope

360
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:12,219
and it allows us
to look at the eclipse

361
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,186
without injury to our eyes.

362
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:17,658
- I didn't bring a scissor.
- I have scissors.

363
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,129
And squares of cardboard
that already have pinholes in them.

364
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,702
And if you really need some help,

365
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,689
ask your dads.

366
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,469
The eclipse is 22 minutes away.

367
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:31,046
Gentlemen, start your engines.

368
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,344
I could have gone golfing.

369
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,453
I had no idea this is
what we'd be in for.

370
00:22:35,578 --> 00:22:37,520
Go ahead. I'll take Ernie home.

371
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,983
You know, Francine taught school
when we were first married.

372
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:45,718
I used to love seeing her standing
in the middle of those little kids

373
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,393
like a telephone pole.

374
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:52,412
There you go.

375
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:55,455
Sally has a crush on her.

376
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,863
Why can't you stare
into the eclipse?

377
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:03,672
What's it going to do, really?
I stare at the sun every day.

378
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,450
- You stare at the sun every day?
- You know, look at it.

379
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:12,836
You know, I see her sometimes
when I'm out running in the morning.

380
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:14,392
You run?

381
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:17,066
Yeah, over by
the high school track.

382
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,489
- Do you talk?
- No,

383
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,857
there's an etiquette to it...
you keep to yourself.

384
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,986
And honestly, that's one of the things
I love about my run... is being alone.

385
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,870
That's hard to come by, you know?

386
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:35,004
Listen.

387
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:38,082
I hate to disappoint you,
but I have to be on my way.

388
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:42,919
- That's too bad.
- I have to be in Albany for dinner.

389
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,382
His master's voice... the governor.

390
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,555
"His master's voice"?
It's an old ad.

391
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:55,856
I know what it is.

392
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,629
What are you doing?

393
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,133
It's the eclipse.
He made a contraption.

394
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:14,294
Don't look at it.

395
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,293
Are you okay?

396
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:26,193
I think so. I feel a lile dizzy.

397
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,396
Take a deep breath.

398
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,505
Is that better?

399
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:40,680
So you never had time to go
to the reservoir anyway.

400
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,006
I only had an hour,
but I figured...

401
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:46,067
That's what you need...
a fainting couch.

402
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:48,355
What's that?

403
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:52,882
Victorian ladies would get over
whelmed from corsets and things.

404
00:24:53,707 --> 00:24:55,785
They'd need a place to lie down.

405
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,327
How do you know that?

406
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:59,381
I used to move furniture.

407
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:03,751
May I walk you to your car?

408
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:08,256
I don't know.
This is still a small town.

409
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,716
No, of course.

410
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,931
So that's a rain check
for the hike.

411
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:20,129
I'll contact you
as soon as I know anything.

412
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:39,416
You don't want to watch it?

413
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,909
I will once it gets
a little further along.

414
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,777
I don't know
if you heard me before,

415
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:45,957
but it only happens
once every 10 years.

416
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,496
You don't want to miss it.

417
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,506
- How's your summer going?
- It's good.

418
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,381
Are you gonna take a vacation?

419
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:57,071
I don't think so.
I'll get August off

420
00:25:57,196 --> 00:25:58,764
then September I'm back at it.

421
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,108
It's all fairly prescribed.

422
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,796
Have you been here in August?
It's a ghost town.

423
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:08,774
- Where are you going?
- We'll be here.

424
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,522
So now I know that.

425
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,260
Most just come right out and ask
if I'm going to be around.

426
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,437
I was just making conversation.
You can change it if you want to.

427
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:24,920
You're all the same...
the drinking, the philandering.

428
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,800
They don't know that word.

429
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,512
Do you want me to leave you alone?
Just say so.

430
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,934
It's hard because
this happens a lot.

431
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:44,884
Nothing is happening.

432
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,394
We're just talking.

433
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,557
And where I come from, school teachers
especially used to say

434
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:55,697
you shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

435
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:57,990
So you're different, huh?

436
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,209
Is that impossible?

437
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:03,155
You're all wearing the same shirt.

438
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,823
So how do people live elsewhere?

439
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,199
They don't have as much.

440
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:18,726
They don't get as bored.

441
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:22,212
I'm not bored.

442
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,649
I can see it! Look!

443
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:35,069
Yes, is he in?

444
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:10,553
Tell him it's Peggy Olson
regarding Clorox.

445
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,452
Of course.

446
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:19,641
Hello.

447
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,574
Miss Olson,
what a pleasant surprise.

448
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:26,953
I haven't changed my mind, and
I'd appreciate you not sending things.

449
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,580
Things you want to keep?

450
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:30,403
I'm sending it back

451
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:32,917
and I hope you take that
as a definitive answer.

452
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,080
I would if you had already sent it.

453
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:38,703
Listen. I've been having meetings
at the Pierre all day, suite 600.

454
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:42,385
At 4:30 Hermes comes by.
Give it back in person.

455
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:44,513
Why are you meeting at the Pierre?

456
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,913
Have you been to Grey?

457
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:48,141
It's a penn station toilet
with venetian blinds.

458
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:52,433
- I can't do that.
- <i>You can and you will,</i>

459
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:53,980
<i>then I'll leave you alone.</i>

460
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:57,325
Suite 600 at 4:30,
not the other way around.

461
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,580
Please don't contact me again.

462
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,207
How was your weekend?

463
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:12,541
Short.

464
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,631
What did Michelson think
of the contract?

465
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:19,839
He hasn't gotten back to me.

466
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,919
That's because he didn't get it.

467
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,911
I called him.

468
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,269
Are you afraid you're
going to have a boss?

469
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:29,319
You will... the client.

470
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,159
- It's not that.
- What is the problem?

471
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:35,378
You think you're more dangerous
without a contract?

472
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:38,025
You are, and it's affecting
our business.

473
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,545
You're our David Ogilvy,
and if you let all the blokes

474
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,083
at Putnam, Powell & Lowe
relax for three years,

475
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,491
maybe we could put
your name out front...

476
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:46,631
After mine...

477
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,769
and Cooper probably.

478
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:54,178
Well, I'll let
you get back to work.

479
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,876
All I need is a letter of intent.

480
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,865
Ben Michelson can rape us later.

481
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:03,842
Grunt once for yes.

482
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:13,131
The problem is I don't know
if you want to do this here

483
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,167
or you don't want
to do this at all.

484
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:19,817
Didn't we give you an office?

485
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:25,072
I just need a minute. I need
to send Martinson's to the printer.

486
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,574
Come on in.

487
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,607
So do you know who you're gonna
put on Hilton yet?

488
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,439
I don't know if they want
a woman's point of view.

489
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:44,729
But I read his book...

490
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:46,444
Who told you we were
going to land Hilton?

491
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,755
Because we're not,

492
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,971
and I resent you bringing work
in here under pretense.

493
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,145
- I didn't...
- I didn't need to sign off on this.

494
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,319
I'm sorry if...

495
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:57,342
I was excited

496
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:59,731
and I heard there was
an amazing assignment.

497
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,817
And you thought you'd come in here
and ask for it because I never say no.

498
00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:05,193
You say "No" all the time.

499
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,072
What do I have to do for you?
Peggy, tell me.

500
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,445
You were my secretary

501
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,569
and now you have
an office and a job

502
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:15,955
that a lot of full-grown men
would kill for.

503
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,717
Every time I turn around,
you've got your hand in my pocket.

504
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:22,081
You want a raise.
You want this account.

505
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,521
Put your nose down
and pay attention to your work,

506
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:26,819
because there's not one thing
that you've done here

507
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:28,551
that I couldn't live without.

508
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,518
I'm sorry, Don.

509
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:36,856
You're good.

510
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,562
Get better, stop asking for things.

511
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,569
Close the door.

512
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,450
Draper residence.

513
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:55,454
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?

514
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,645
I'm well, thank you.

515
00:31:57,803 --> 00:31:58,953
<i>Is Don about?</i>

516
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:01,252
No, he's not home yet.
Shall I leave word?

517
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:04,963
Actually, Betty, if I could be frank,
it's important.

518
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,132
- What's wrong?
- <i>Well, it's a little touchy.</i>

519
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,385
I don't want to put you
in a strange position.

520
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,306
What's wrong, Roger?

521
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,267
Well, it's about his contract.

522
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:19,307
What about it?

523
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,775
I know you have to be
on the same page as him...

524
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,359
He's your husband...
but it's a lot of money, Betty.

525
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,155
Three years isn't
that long, you know.

526
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm sorry. What do you want?

527
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,871
I want you to see what you
can do to get him to sign it.

528
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:39,414
I know you're
the woman behind the man.

529
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:42,332
Don is going to do whatever
he's going to do.

530
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,603
And honestly, I find it
terribly disrespectful

531
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,422
that you would go behind his back.

532
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:47,861
Easy, Betty,

533
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,149
- <i>That's not...</i>
- I have to go.

534
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:56,264
You missed Hermes. I was going
to give you 10 more minutes.

535
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:03,214
You came all this way,
have a drink.

536
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,309
What are you having?

537
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,239
Whatever you're having.

538
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:15,358
I'm not having anything.

539
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,483
A whiskey.

540
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,912
You are Don's girl, aren't you?

541
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:22,082
I was raised on whiskey.

542
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:25,105
Sit down.

543
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,311
A few minutes of adult conversation
and we both go home.

544
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,902
Grey has Hermes, Macy's,

545
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,297
HJ Heinz baby food and Revlon.

546
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,728
- You need someone in a skirt.
- Everybody does.

547
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,565
Copy chief?

548
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,172
Maybe once they get used to you,

549
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:50,924
but definitely more money.

550
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,855
Would I get to go
to Paris for Hermes?

551
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:58,368
They come here, but you're not going
anywhere where you are.

552
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,533
I can't.

553
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:10,509
Just so you know,
that's what opportunity looks like.

554
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,759
I'm just sorry I won't
be seeing you every day.

555
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,624
What are you doing?

556
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:26,109
I was just thinking about
all the times I walked by you

557
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:27,772
and didn't even notice.

558
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:32,975
How is that possible?

559
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:46,072
What do you want from me?

560
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,311
I want to take you in that bedroom,

561
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,560
lock the door,

562
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:54,136
take your clothes off with my teeth,
throw you on the bed

563
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,111
and give you a go-around
like you've never had.

564
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:18,586
Bobby, Sally, turn off
the TV and go upstairs.

565
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:24,812
What's wrong?

566
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,331
Roger Sterling called.

567
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,302
He pretended to be calling for you

568
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:32,755
and then he started on me
about your contract.

569
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:34,185
What?

570
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,861
Your contract, Don.

571
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,076
It was very uncomfortable.

572
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:45,499
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

573
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,624
- I'm calling him.
- Don't.

574
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,687
Don't worry about my job.

575
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:52,914
Why would I?
I don't know anything about it.

576
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,818
They offered you a contract
and you didn't say a damn thing to me.

577
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,987
I had to hear about it from him.

578
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,288
And why the hell won't you sign it?

579
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,912
It doesn't concern you.
You're taken care of.

580
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,051
Why won't you sign it?

581
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,281
Let me explain something
to you about business,

582
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:13,044
since as usual you're turning this
into something about yourself.

583
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,938
No contract means
I have all the power.

584
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,925
They want me,
but they can't have me.

585
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:21,087
You're right.

586
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,224
Why would I think that
has anything to do with me?

587
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,748
It's three years, Don.

588
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:30,572
What's the matter?

589
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,562
You don't know where you're
going to be in three years?

590
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:39,876
Good night.

591
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,637
I love the taste of liquor
on your breath.

592
00:37:20,897 --> 00:37:22,826
- Where you headed?
- Niagara falls.

593
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,124
But we'll settle
for the nearest motel.

594
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Hop in.

595
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:38,763
Thank you.

596
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:43,427
I'm Doug. This is Sandy.

597
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:45,214
Nice to meet you.

598
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:48,973
- How far are we?
- A couple of miles.

599
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,465
You wanna know
why we're going to Niagara falls?

600
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,226
We're getting married.

601
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,741
At Niagara falls. Fancy that.

602
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,914
People keep trying
to talk us out of it.

603
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:03,427
Why's that?

604
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:06,613
Well, we don't really know
each other that well.

605
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:09,503
We knew each other a little bit
in high school

606
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:12,271
and we're not really
in love or anything.

607
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,491
I'm sure you have a good reason,

608
00:38:14,616 --> 00:38:16,489
not that it's any of my business.

609
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:19,004
I'm not knocked up.
They're passing a law

610
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,678
that if you're married,
they can't send you to Vietnam.

611
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:25,489
I don't know if you've served, mister.
I don't want to offend you.

612
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,013
Again, none of my business.

613
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:33,137
It's just I'm 1A, 22.
I can't get into school.

614
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,430
I kind of have a target on my back,
and for what?

615
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,480
I think they're really gonna
start sending people.

616
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:43,027
I have it on good authority
that you're right.

617
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:45,177
Good authority?

618
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,681
Are you a spook?

619
00:38:51,554 --> 00:38:52,554
Nope.

620
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:54,877
I'm in advertising.

621
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:57,678
No way.

622
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,604
Now that's priceless.

623
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:01,715
But you seem okay.

624
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:03,805
Thank you.

625
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,331
It's a beautiful night.

626
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:11,202
It smells good...

627
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,139
but everything smells good
when you're high.

628
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,140
That's true.

629
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:25,719
Listen, Cadillac,

630
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:29,865
we don't have gas money, but...

631
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:35,229
they're reds.

632
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:37,915
You ever have them? What are they?

633
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:39,875
Phenobarbital.

634
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,395
They're my dad's.

635
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,978
Give me one.

636
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:46,265
Make it two.

637
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,746
Does he know how to dance?

638
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,150
Who cares?

639
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:26,791
- How old are you?
- 19.

640
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:28,827
How old are you?

641
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,107
- Why can't you go to school?
- Because it's a waste of time, man.

642
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:42,266
You like to watch us dance?

643
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,605
Yeah, you want to watch us?

644
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:01,467
A hill Billy knocks on the door
of his new neighbor's house.

645
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,353
"Howdy, neighbor," he says.

646
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:05,668
"In honor of you moving
into the holler,"

647
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:07,354
"I'm gonna throw a party."

648
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:09,479
"There's gonna be
a whole lot of drinking,"

649
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:12,718
"a whole lot of dancing
and a whole lot of screwing."

650
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,681
"Sounds like fun," the neighbor says.
"What can I bring?"

651
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,281
The hillbilly replies,

652
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:24,167
"you can bring anything you want...
it's just gonna be you and me."

653
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,979
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?

654
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,171
Look at you.

655
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,593
Up to your old tricks.

656
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,963
You're a bum. You know that?

657
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:50,481
No, I'm not.

658
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,887
You wouldn't expect him
to be taken so easily.

659
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,230
Shut up.

660
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,766
You can't be tied down.

661
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,852
- That's right.
- Look at your hands.

662
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:05,438
They're as soft as a woman's.

663
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,294
What do you do?

664
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,143
What do you make?

665
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:13,196
You grow bullshit.

666
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,602
- I gave him two.
- How the hell is he still awake?

667
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:52,380
"Mister, thank you for the help.
We left you your car."

668
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,797
Everything okay?

669
00:43:17,255 --> 00:43:19,645
I'm worried that housekeeping
is going to come in.

670
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,263
I put out the sign.

671
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,892
I'll call them when we're done.

672
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,547
I don't know.

673
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:28,419
Come on.

674
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,181
I love the morning.

675
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:39,232
What were you thinking?

676
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:40,357
It's awful.

677
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:42,482
It's an antique.

678
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:46,539
We discussed this for months
and we decided antiques were expected.

679
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:50,318
Look around!
You have ruined the whole room.

680
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:55,742
If you want to keep it,
please do not tell people I did this.

681
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,850
- Morning.
- Fender bender.

682
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,605
I'm going to get coffee.
Do you want some?

683
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:12,357
No, thank you.

684
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:18,660
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

685
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:20,881
- Fender bender.
- I'm sorry.

686
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,656
Mr. Cooper's waiting for you.

687
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:24,595
Thank you.

688
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,734
Good morning.

689
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:31,156
Sit down.

690
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,069
What do you want?

691
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,969
Sacajawea carried a baby

692
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,956
on her back all the way
to the Pacific ocean,

693
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:47,152
and somewhere that baby thinks
he discovered America.

694
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:52,183
You, Don, have been standing
on someone's shoulders.

695
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:55,507
We brought you in,
we nurtured you like family

696
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:58,778
and now's the time to pay us back.

697
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,890
You can't go any further
on your own, Don.

698
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:15,023
Would you say I know something
about you, Don?

699
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,718
I would.

700
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:29,781
Then sign.

701
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,697
After all, when it comes down to it,

702
00:45:36,822 --> 00:45:39,082
who is really signing
this contract anyway?

703
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:00,858
I don't want anymore contact
with Roger Sterling.

704
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:20,945
I signed it.
