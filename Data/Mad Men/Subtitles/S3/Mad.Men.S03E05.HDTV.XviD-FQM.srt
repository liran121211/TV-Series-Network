1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:06,005
I could have had you. I could have
shamed you into being with me.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,175
Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt ?

3
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,260
- Yes, I am. What is it ?
- He passed away.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,846
He's dead
and he's never coming back.

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,057
You know what you did
to Freddy Ramson ?

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,267
I refuse to fell bad,
we' are going to get raises.

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,585
Don, it is very necessary ?

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,771
It is.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,815
Because he loves this room and hearing
his own voice and saving the day.

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,818
Duck, would you excuse us
for a moment ?

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,719
Synchro: Hutch

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,520
Season 3 Episode 5
<i>The Fog</i>

13
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:13,546
I was expecting the Piersons as well,
but they're not coming.

14
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:14,521
Please.

15
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,790
My goodness.

16
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,084
Of course. Here, take mine.

17
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,012
I appreciate that
both of you are here.

18
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,349
What happened?

19
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,117
The children were
at the water fountain during gym

20
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:47,192
and Sally told Becky Pierson
she should save some for the fish.

21
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,756
Becky ignored her.

22
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,219
Sally hit the back of her head
and her face went into the spigot.

23
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,893
And then Becky went after her...

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,283
Hair pulling, scratching.

25
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,787
She didn't need stitches
in the end, I understand?

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,548
This girl... This Becky Pierson,

27
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,221
- Sally told me she's a bruiser.
- She's heavy.

28
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,970
The children poke pencils
into her sides

29
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,568
when she's sitting because they think
she can't feel it.

30
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:17,268
- Sally doesn't do that, does she?
- No...

31
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:19,469
But...

32
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,474
this bad behavior is new.

33
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:25,770
I know that you're expecting a child,
but she already has a little brother.

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,732
I guess what I'm asking is,
has anything changed at home recently?

35
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:33,768
My...

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,380
My father passed away

37
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,283
last week...

38
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,247
The week before... Two weeks now.

39
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,393
I feel terrible for bringing that
up for you.

40
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,585
Well, it... it has not been easy.

41
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,969
Is this grandpa Gene
we're talking about?

42
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,407
Oh, that poor thing.

43
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,731
Sally didn't mention it?

44
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,740
Why didn't you call us
or send a note?

45
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,246
I don't think she missed a day.

46
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,818
Did she go to the funeral?

47
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,148
Why would we put her through that?

48
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:18,632
I don't think children
belong in graveyards.

49
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:23,327
No, of course not.

50
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,582
Now I realize why she was asking
all those questions

51
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,459
about Medgar Evers' murder.

52
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,592
She was?

53
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,020
I'm... I'm sorry.

54
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,547
I have to use
the ladies'room again.

55
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,146
- We can talk about this another time.
- No, I'm not as upset as I look.

56
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,821
I... I can't help this.

57
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,376
I am mortified.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,148
- It's not a good time.

59
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:54,744
No, and...

60
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,922
it really should be, shouldn't it?

61
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,726
Sally does need more attention.

62
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,657
She's grieving.

63
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,312
There is a very special pain

64
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,644
to losing someone at that age.

65
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,281
I don't know if you can
understand that.

66
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:15,834
I can.

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,210
Mrs. Draper, I was just talking
to your husband

68
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,267
and this really can wait.

69
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:29,923
Are you sure?

70
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,160
Because I just want
to put it behind us.

71
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,818
I just really want everything to be okay
when the baby comes.

72
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,030
It's going to be
a beautiful summer.

73
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:48,752
****

74
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,319
75. Hat-check tip

75
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:52,586
50.

76
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,389
Tap the restaurant ***.
$1.12. Tipped *** 38.

77
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,057
Dinner $19.44."

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,440
It's better to have a bit of Don Draper
than no Don Draper at all.

79
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,253
I'd like that in writing.

80
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,256
It seems strange
that the two of you went

81
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:13,316
on the same overnight trip
and you put in for $70

82
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:15,272
and he put in for $82.

83
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,126
If I were lying, wouldn't I have made it
a round number?

84
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,302
Not that Don's lying.

85
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,563
I signed his receipts, didn't I?

86
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:27,201
Which brings us to the undocumented
portion of my assessment.

87
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:30,914
The amount of pencils, pens,

88
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,123
pads, paper and postage

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,290
that are currently being consumed
suit a company four times our size.

90
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,132
It has also been brought to my attention
that a credenza

91
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:45,412
has disappeared...

92
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:48,347
A theft that I believe
necessitates a conspiracy.

93
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,478
People forget that Karl Marx was
the greatest economist who ever lived.

94
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,568
And whatever you think
of his solution,

95
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,814
the problem he posed was
about the catastrophic up

96
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,192
and down of the marketplace.

97
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,360
Tell the folks at Admiral that Karl Marx
says everything's okay.

98
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,752
"Boom and bust. Bull and bear.
I need a tv. I have a tv."

99
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,512
Damn it, someone helped Ken cherry-pick
all of Burt's successful accounts

100
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:10,253
and I've been left with the dogs.

101
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:12,506
- Admiral is not a dog.
- Sales are flat.

102
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,045
It's all over their memos.

103
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,502
And now I have to look them
in the eye with nothing...

104
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,044
Except maybe new creative.

105
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:21,672
Stop it.

106
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,605
Now you're interested.

107
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,970
There are some areas of growth,
and I me literally areas...

108
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:29,563
Atlanta, Oakland,

109
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,440
Chicago, Detroit,

110
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,268
Newark, D. C.

111
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,144
Great jazz cities.

112
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,713
And I left out St. Louis
and Kansas city... Also growing.

113
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,609
- What does that mean?
- Great jazz musicians?

114
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,322
Seriously, is it possible that these
Admirals are being bought by negroes?

115
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,787
Lois caught her scarf
putting paper in the Xerox.

116
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,162
Maybe when Joan leaves
I can finally get rid of her.

117
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,898
Can you pretend like you're back
in the media department

118
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,498
and tell me what this says to you?

119
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,042
Look at the cities.

120
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,961
Is it possible that negroes
are outbuying other people 2:1?

121
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,446
You could jump to that
conclusion, I suppose.

122
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,967
Did you hear about Lois?

123
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,511
- You've got a winner there, Kinsey.
- Did you see it?

124
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,021
I did.

125
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:15,592
So what's everybody doing tonight?
Baby. Married.

126
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:20,085
Do you want to go to the Mets game?
Tickets and a watch.

127
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,066
Why, thank you, birds eye.

128
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,750
Does the watch say
"birds eye" on it?

129
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,346
No, it says "Hamilton electric."

130
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,574
What time is it?
What time isn't it?

131
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,620
Admiral is happy. We're happy.

132
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,538
They're not happy!

133
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,832
"Morris, comma,"

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,397
"in reference to retooling the factory
for London fog children's"

135
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,213
"and young adults"...

136
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,051
I thought I'd bring you the minutes of
the meeting, since you had to run off.

137
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,901
You're wasting paper.

138
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,646
I'd have to make 1,000 to keep up
with your department.

139
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,402
They waste paper because
they throw out bad ideas.

140
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,898
They waste paper because they use it
to sop up spilled drinks

141
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,906
right after their
mid-afternoon naps.

142
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,598
You came here because we do this
better than you, nd part of that

143
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:16,161
is letting our creatives be
unproductive until they are.

144
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:19,373
Pennies make pounds,
and pounds make profits.

145
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:22,122
I don't want
to talk to you this way.

146
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,254
I've tried it before
and it never works.

147
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,464
I'm not usually this emotional.

148
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:30,134
You want to make money?

149
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:36,835
Start getting your nails dirty
with Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.

150
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:41,562
Clients love to pay for media
and creative needs pencils.

151
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,648
I suppose I hadn't necessarily thought
of it that way.

152
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,725
And lay off of expense accounts.

153
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,944
Think of the men's moral,
not just your own.

154
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,656
You've obviously seen
"Bridge on the river kwai."

155
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,739
I've seen everything.
You have my ticket stubs.

156
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,648
<i>Your uncle Herman is on the line.
He won't leave a message.</i>

157
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,775
Uncle herman?

158
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,775
My goodness,
is aunt Alice all right?

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,087
- Who is this?
- It's Peter,

160
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:23,562
- Dottie's boy. You called me.
- It's duck... Duck phillips.

161
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,064
- Duck.
- <i>Sorry for the cloak and dagger.</i>

162
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,410
I didn't want to set off
any alarm bells.

163
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,762
My name is Herman, you know that.

164
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,031
Except that I actually have
an uncle Herman and he's 91.

165
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,213
That's a sick joke. I apologize.

166
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,399
It's been too long.

167
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:40,727
I don't know if you heard,
but I'm at grey now.

168
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,377
What's that like?

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,589
People walking around
the halls all the time,

170
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,564
laughing their heads off?

171
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,775
We're going to
have lunch, you know.

172
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,840
I don't know, Duck.
It doesn't sound like a good idea.

173
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,212
Campbell, this is beyond
"no hard feelings."

174
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:57,512
I won't waste your time.
Haven't I always been on your side?

175
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,935
- When?
- <i>I'll have my girl call your girl.</i>

176
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,100
I'll say it's Clorox.

177
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:14,589
- Hello?

178
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:17,936
Anyone home?

179
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,411
I'll get it.

180
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,706
- <i>Mr. Draper?</i>
- Yes.

181
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,737
This is Suzanne Farrell,

182
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,215
Sally's teacher.

183
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,491
I'm not interrupting dinner, am I?

184
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:36,715
I just felt I should call and apologize
about our meeting this morning.

185
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,153
Why?

186
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,605
What I mean is

187
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,837
my father died when I was eight

188
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,820
and I might have overdone it,

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,340
<i>relating to Sally in that way.</i>

190
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,070
<i>I didn't mean to upset your wife.</i>

191
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,902
I guess I can get a little
caught up in things

192
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,956
and lose perspective.

193
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,630
I don't know why I'm calling.
I'm embarrassing myself.

194
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,843
No, you're fine.

195
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,694
If there's anything I can do...

196
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,789
Thanks for the call.

197
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,462
It's time to go.

198
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,520
Okay, we're going.
Let me get my keys.

199
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,202
They're in your hand.

200
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,304
Francine took the kids.

201
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,177
Who was that?

202
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:43,716
No one.

203
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,869
If you're parked in emergency,
you'll have to move soon.

204
00:11:48,994 --> 00:11:51,215
Of course, let's make sure
it's not a false alarm.

205
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,528
- This is my third time.
- We sent you home before?

206
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:54,796
No, third baby.

207
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,624
Your job's done. The solarium's down
the hall to the right.

208
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,812
Hang in there, Betts.

209
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,280
I came in early to cover for a friend,
so there's a chance

210
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,064
I'll see you the whole way through.

211
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,500
Daddy!

212
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,453
You can scream and yell
as much as you want in this hallway,

213
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:32,800
but we're about
to pass the nursery.

214
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:34,387
Of course.

215
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,262
Excuse me.

216
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,390
I know it's silly, but I seem to be
having trouble with this pen.

217
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,065
- I believe it's empty.
- I've gotta go.

218
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,764
Are you planning to give
the baby the breast?

219
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,350
The last time you ate?

220
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,318
Lunch...

221
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,326
Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.

222
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,451
Pineapple?

223
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,445
What were you thinking?
Anything else, sweetheart?

224
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,112
Life savers.

225
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,335
- Has your water broken?
- My water never breaks.

226
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,963
When will Dr. Aldridge be here?

227
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,054
Joseph Waddell?

228
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,600
- I'm Dennis Hobart.
- That's good to know.

229
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,187
I haven't seen anybody an hour.
What's going on?

230
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:37,705
- We've had a shift change.
- My wife Pam,

231
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,184
- Pamela Hobart.
- She's fine.

232
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:42,625
The baby's breech.
We're calling in a specialist.

233
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,073
- What?
- Didn't somebody get your permission?

234
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:48,374
Damn it, what is with you people?
I don't know a damn thing!

235
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,371
Please don't raise your voice.

236
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,873
Now I apologize,
but we need your permission.

237
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,833
Do whatever you have to do.

238
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,586
We'll update you
religiously. I promise.

239
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,974
This is not how I pictured it.

240
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,557
Where's all the backslapping?

241
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,435
You know,

242
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,646
I brought this because I thought
it'd be a party in here.

243
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,934
- It's not, but I'll have one.
- Right now?

244
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:22,698
Whenever you want.

245
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,624
I left work this morning.

246
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,497
I've been here all day.

247
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,941
I am so bored.

248
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,535
I even called in.

249
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,239
Like the prison
can't run without me.

250
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,722
Have you done this before?

251
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,562
Twice.

252
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,276
You know, I never thought
to bring a bottle.

253
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:05,654
Well, what are we supposed to do?

254
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,704
My daughter took forever.

255
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,548
I remember being pretty worked up.

256
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,226
The nurse said, "don't forget:"

257
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,294
"your wife's in the boat;
you're on the shore."

258
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,073
The other one a boy?

259
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,342
Yes.

260
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:31,388
You throw the ball around?

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Not enough.

262
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:56,495
All right, Mrs. Draper,

263
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,812
I'm going to need you to get on the bed
so I can prepare you for delivery.

264
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:01,752
This part should be familiar.

265
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,786
I'll shave you and then give you
a quick low enema.

266
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:19,185
The good news is time has stopped.

267
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,746
I'd like to have a gold watch one day,
but I can't, you know?

268
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,322
You don't want to have anything
on you like that.

269
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:27,897
Do they attack you?

270
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:33,085
I knew it was just a matter of time
before you started with the questions.

271
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:36,385
I bet you have a nightmare where you
end up in sing sing, right?

272
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,760
Everybody does.

273
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:39,822
I do.

274
00:16:40,636 --> 00:16:41,986
So what's it like?

275
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:44,961
You're outnumbered,

276
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,137
but you've got the power.

277
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:49,299
Kind of like being a king.

278
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:51,718
Except your subjects
want to kill you.

279
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,012
Maybe,

280
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:56,014
but they don't 'cause they
know I'm dangerous

281
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,141
and I've got a badge,
which they respect.

282
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,987
How do they know you're dangerous?

283
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,482
Well, they're not all bad.
There's extremes.

284
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,700
We've got death row and
then we've got the baseball team.

285
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,861
In'29 they played the Yankees.

286
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,324
- Everybody in stripes.

287
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,211
You're a funny one.

288
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,485
I tell a lot of jokes at work.

289
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,461
You hear some doozies.

290
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,596
I have to watch what
I do when I leave work,

291
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,176
be careful not to bring it home.

292
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,548
Especially with a kid, right?

293
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,075
Just yesterday I was in a block

294
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,613
and I thought, "every single one
of these animals,"

295
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:48,191
"their mother had them,
they were a baby."

296
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,986
And I think, "there they are,
on the other side of the fence."

297
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,862
And you know what?

298
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,367
Every one of them blamed
their mom and dad.

299
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:01,152
- That's a bullshit excuse.
- That's true, Don.

300
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,763
- You have little veins.

301
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,414
Breathe and think
about the beauty parlor.

302
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,511
Do you need
to call someone else in?

303
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:20,636
It's in.

304
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,022
The medication will help
with the pain

305
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,179
and put you in a twilight sleep.

306
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,609
- Where is Dr. Aldridge?
- He's in the city.

307
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,389
He went to Mama Leone's
for his anniversary.

308
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,987
- Isn't that sweet?
- Is he drinking?

309
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,387
'cause my aunt Emma,
her doctor was drunk,

310
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:37,949
and he ruined her bladder.

311
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,911
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician,
is on duty and will fill in.

312
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:43,873
I don't want him.

313
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,952
- I don't know him.
- He's our top man.

314
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:47,449
I want Dr. Aldridge.

315
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,836
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

316
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,324
I don't want another doctor.
I want my doctor.

317
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:53,449
Sit back.

318
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:55,212
You're at 5cm.

319
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,763
That's halfway from here to the hebrides
and other mountain ranges

320
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,264
which we are currently studying
in chapter 12.

321
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,286
The doctor will be here and there.

322
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,703
The hebrides are islands.

323
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,515
Try it now.

324
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,800
Thank you, sister.

325
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,351
What do you make her for? 16?

326
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:27,678
Pam was screaming at me in the car.

327
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,103
I don't think that's unusual.

328
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,765
That's my girl in there.

329
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,485
If something happens to her,

330
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,282
I just don't know what I'd do.

331
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,326
And then there'd be that baby.

332
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,351
How could I love that baby?

333
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,952
Our worst fears lie
in anticipation.

334
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,302
You're so sure about that?

335
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,766
- I want to go home, you bitch!
- Please relax.

336
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,015
Let go of me!
Get your hands off me!

337
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,439
- Where's Don?
- He's in the waiting room.

338
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:17,946
- She can't hear you.
- The hell I can't.

339
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,613
Where is he? Where's Don?!

340
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,163
- He's in the waiting room.
- Bullshit.

341
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,274
He's never where
you expect him to be.

342
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:31,164
Have you seen him?
Have you been with him?

343
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,516
7cm.

344
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,102
- She's starting transition.
- Someone call him.

345
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,378
I don't want to be here.

346
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,320
A push of demerol, 25mg.

347
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,557
I'm just a housewife.

348
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:50,412
Why are you doing this to me?

349
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:00,485
Mr. Hobart?

350
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,708
Congratulations.
You have a little baby boy.

351
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:06,866
My God.

352
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,368
Your wife and your baby
are doing fine.

353
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,954
Can I go in? Can I see her?

354
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:14,113
Not right now. She lost a lot of blood
and had a transfusion.

355
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:16,334
What? Please, I have to see her.

356
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:19,302
Please, she's in recovery, resting.

357
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:22,110
But you can go to the nursery
and look in at your son.

358
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:24,758
- It's just down the hall.
- Thank you.

359
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:33,109
A baby boy.

360
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,913
- Congratulations.
- You're all right, Don.

361
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,071
I'm sure yours is
gonna be good too.

362
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,436
You know what?

363
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,110
I know it.

364
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,583
Thanks, Dennis.

365
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,254
You're an honest guy.

366
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,756
Believe me. I'm an expert.

367
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,677
Go see your baby.

368
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,886
Why do they put up with us?

369
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:11,938
We don't deserve it.

370
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,978
This is a fresh start.

371
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:20,572
I don't know who's up there,

372
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,318
so I'm saying this to you.

373
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,813
I'm gonna be better.

374
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:28,572
I'm gonna be a better man.

375
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,745
Tell me you heard me.

376
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:39,667
I heard you.

377
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:55,873
Don't fight the urge to bear down.

378
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,811
I can't.

379
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:00,811
I can't.

380
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:03,382
I can't do it.

381
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:07,420
Either you can do it or we will,
but it's going to come out some way.

382
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:46,605
Daddy?

383
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,483
- Who are you?
- It's me.

384
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:54,585
I don't know you.

385
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,612
It's me... Elizabeth.

386
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,361
You do know me.

387
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:08,631
Okay, so it's me.

388
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:12,135
- What are you doing here?
- I had to go away.

389
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:15,609
- Well, don't you Miss me?
- Of course.

390
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:18,173
Listen.

391
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,546
Nobody knows I'm here, okay?

392
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:28,818
Am I dying?

393
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:31,424
Ask your mother.

394
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,772
Tell her, Ruthie.

395
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,411
Shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

396
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:47,049
I left my lunch pail on the bus

397
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:48,838
and I'm having a baby.

398
00:25:50,694 --> 00:25:52,800
Do you see what happens
to people who speak up?

399
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,222
Be happy with what you have.

400
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,547
You'll be okay.

401
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:03,611
You're a house cat...
You're very important

402
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,486
and you have little to do.

403
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,539
She's beautiful.

404
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:51,441
That's a boy.

405
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,697
You look terrible.

406
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,361
How do you feel?

407
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,806
I need to put my face on.

408
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:11,796
You look beautiful, Betts.

409
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,049
Gene.

410
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,445
What did you say?

411
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:22,390
His name is Eugene.

412
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,269
We don't have to decide that now.

413
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:30,113
Gene.

414
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,548
- Did you get any sleep?

415
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:48,541
No, and I don't expect to
for the next six months.

416
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:56,277
I wasn't sure where to put it all.

417
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,003
Mr. Draper's office.

418
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,407
Please hold.

419
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:05,516
It's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?

420
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Da.

421
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,806
- Where are you?
- Down the hall.

422
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:21,562
How's Betty?
Did she perform like a champ?

423
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,868
- She did.
- <i>I need his initials.</i>

424
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:27,204
Jane's gonna put them on the back
of her yacht or something for him.

425
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,664
No name yet.

426
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,496
There's a lot of guys twiddling
their thumbs down in art.

427
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:34,569
- Why were you in the art department?
- Lane was.

428
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:36,365
Apparently we're all backed up.

429
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,606
No one will move forward
without your approval.

430
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:41,302
- I missed half a day.
- Betty had the baby, not you.

431
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,742
- I'll see what I can do.
- Good.

432
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:46,592
That guy's a tick.

433
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:48,684
See you at the traffic meeting.

434
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,508
Can I get some coffee?

435
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,992
You know what it's
like in that office.

436
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:01,867
No one ever buys me lunch.

437
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:06,243
- I like the turtleneck.
- Really?

438
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:18,047
- Come. Join us.
- What is she doing here?

439
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:20,041
Don't worry about it.
I know what I'm doing.

440
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,342
- No, you don't.
- Have a nosh.

441
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,842
Two months at grey and you're already
having a nosh?

442
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,590
I didn't know until I got here.

443
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:39,444
Look.

444
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,543
I woke up one day
and had a realization.

445
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,740
You two have a secret relationship.

446
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:48,994
- What? That's ridiculous.
- Come on.

447
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,039
The way you handled that Freddy Rumsen
thing so that she could move up?

448
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,538
I've been doing this a long time.
I know what I saw.

449
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:59,153
- That's not what happened.
- You can be modest if you want to,

450
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:01,757
but that kind of focused ambition is
rare in advertising.

451
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:04,305
Thank you.

452
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,809
I want to take you both with me
to the promised land.

453
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:12,182
At grey an account man is
expected to have ideas,

454
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,433
and creatives are
expected to be geniuses.

455
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,817
You'll be sitting on velvet pillows,
showered with riches, awards.

456
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,433
We're not going anywhere.
Well, she can.

457
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,821
Do we have to go together?

458
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:30,349
Pete, I know you have ideas
and you're a risk-taker.

459
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:32,705
Sterling Cooper is never
going to reward that.

460
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:36,417
Well, thank you.

461
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,871
- Anything else?
- Don't be a baby.

462
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:42,047
You should be taking meetings
like this twice a week.

463
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,871
If you want to woo me,
you'll have to buy me my own lunch.

464
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,349
- Maybe I should leave too.
- Why would you do that?

465
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:56,896
You're so talented. You should strike
while they iron's hot.

466
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:00,232
- What does that mean?
- It means the sky's the limit.

467
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:02,245
No mortgage, no family.

468
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,907
You're a free-going
career gal with great ideas.

469
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:06,495
Am I wrong?

470
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:09,334
I don't know.

471
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,150
This is your time, Peggy.

472
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,255
Let me ask you something, Hollis:

473
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,330
what type of tv do you have?

474
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,911
- An RCA.
- Really?

475
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:41,998
Color?

476
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:45,986
- Why did you get it?
- To watch tv.

477
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,773
But why an RCA specifically?

478
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,397
I didn't see
any difference, I guess.

479
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,183
16.

480
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:57,496
Good afternoon.

481
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,272
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral.

482
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,603
I've done research.

483
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:06,928
I have an RCA.

484
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,491
So do your friends buy Admirals?

485
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,400
I'm sorry, sir. I can't really say.

486
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:21,564
Look.

487
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:25,359
This is important and I'd really like
to have an honest conversation with you.

488
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:27,843
I don't want to get into trouble.

489
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:28,949
It's just us.

490
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,325
- It's just hollis and...
- Mr. Campbell.

491
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,763
Do you think I'm a bigot?

492
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,599
I just want to know
why you bought your tv.

493
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:45,326
- I don't know. I don't remember.
- It's your tv.

494
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:48,882
- It's a big purchase.
- I don't even watch the damn thing.

495
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:52,013
- Really? Why not?
- Why should I?

496
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:55,639
We've got bigger problems
to worry about than tv, okay?

497
00:32:57,074 --> 00:32:59,448
You're thinking about this
in a very narrow way.

498
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:02,087
The idea is that everyone is going
to have a house, a car,

499
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:04,565
a television... The american dream.

500
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,175
It's my job.

501
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:19,090
Every job has it's ups and downs.

502
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,962
You don't watch baseball?
I don't believe you.

503
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:02,399
What are you doing out of bed?

504
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:04,324
I smelled something.

505
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,150
- What are you making?
- A snack.

506
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,400
Do you want some?

507
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:11,715
I didn't know you could cook.

508
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,214
Mommy's much better at it.

509
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:20,849
- Are you looking for a chick?
- I am.

510
00:34:23,557 --> 00:34:26,438
Miss Farrell told us about that
when we went to the farm.

511
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,628
But she says that those eggs can never
become a chicken,

512
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:33,752
even though they come
out of a chicken.

513
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:37,574
- Why's that?
- Because they're from the store.

514
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,902
And you know what else?

515
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:43,255
If you hold an egg up
and it has veins in it,

516
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,416
you can shake it then eat it.

517
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,541
Really?

518
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,913
It's called addling.

519
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,719
Is the baby gonna live
in grandpa Gene's room?

520
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:05,728
It's not grandpa Gene's room.
It's the baby's room.

521
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:13,068
I thought it was gonna be a girl.

522
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:15,654
Well, I thought
you were gonna be a boy.

523
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:21,410
Not all surprises are bad.

524
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:32,674
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- That's what miss Farrell said.

525
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,017
Well, then I guess it must be true.

526
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:02,561
Burt Peterson's firing
was undignified.

527
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,496
Building security...
That's all I'll say.

528
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,266
Confirm a couple of rumors.

529
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:10,514
Did he throw a desk chair
against a window

530
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,544
only to have it bounce back
and knock him over?

531
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,387
Not that I know of.

532
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:16,955
Did he make a #2 in a file cabinet?

533
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,385
Burt Peterson lived hard
and loved hard.

534
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,515
Harry here is an expert in media.

535
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,642
Television...
The air, not the sets.

536
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,270
Now Admiral television
sales are flat...

537
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,387
We know that.

538
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:33,094
But as we studied your indices

539
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:35,451
we realized that
they're not flat everywhere.

540
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:36,433
In fact,

541
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:39,530
among negroes sales are
actually growing.

542
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:42,741
- We know that too.
- You do?

543
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:48,396
No, of course you do.

544
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,710
These are your numbers,
but I think we've discovered

545
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,361
an interesting strategy.

546
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:57,506
This is "Ebony."

547
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,837
By negroes for negroes.

548
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,678
"Jet."

549
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:07,489
Space in these magazines
costs far less than

550
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:09,364
what you currently spend...

551
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:14,690
Daily newspapers that go just to
this market for pennies on the dollar.

552
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:16,491
And?

553
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:27,041
Shift a portion of the media budget
from lower-indexing white areas

554
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,060
to this market where
it can do more good.

555
00:37:29,185 --> 00:37:32,165
They already like it, we can make them
buy more by increasing the exposure.

556
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:34,740
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone

557
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:37,588
would make you the same profit as
a 2% increase systemwide.

558
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:41,569
And ads on television geared
to this market and white markets

559
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:43,176
will have double the effect.

560
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,304
A negro ad and a white ad?

561
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,600
So, Campbell, you're making twice
the ads for us now.

562
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:51,968
No, do them together.

563
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:53,437
Integrate it.

564
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,302
I don't think that's legal.

565
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:57,900
Of course it's legal.

566
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,527
Look, this conversation is
not worth having.

567
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:05,180
Who's to say that negroes aren't buying
Admiral televisions

568
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:07,618
because they think
white people want them?

569
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,490
<i>Miss Olson is here to see you.</i>

570
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,217
Send her in.

571
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:22,674
Oh, sorry.

572
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:29,255
I know he doesn't need clothes,
but don't return it.

573
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,521
I'm the youngest.
I never had anything new.

574
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:35,187
- You didn't have to do that.
- I did.

575
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:38,716
No one told me they were all going
in on it together.

576
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:44,863
I heard you were back at work,
but now I wonder if that's true.

577
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,365
I invited you in.

578
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,215
I don't know if this
is the best time.

579
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:53,121
I don't know. It's kind of serious.

580
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:03,996
I've been thinking
about my situation here

581
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:07,177
and I'm so grateful to you
for all you've done.

582
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,679
I just...

583
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:12,878
Well, you know

584
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:15,103
I'm paid very little.

585
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,833
My secretary doesn't respect me

586
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,190
because I make $71 more a week
than she does.

587
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,651
Maybe we need to get you
a cheaper secretary.

588
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:26,837
Paul Kinsey does
the same work that I do,

589
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:28,822
and not as well sometimes.

590
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,368
And I don't know
if you read it in the paper,

591
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:34,458
but they passed a law where women who
do the same work as men

592
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,533
will get paid the same thing.

593
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:37,867
Equal pay.

594
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:41,461
It's not a good time.

595
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,711
It's not a good time for me, Don.

596
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:46,717
- Do you know how expensive the city is?
- It's not gonna happen,

597
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:48,531
Peggy, not now.

598
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,971
I'm fighting
for paperclips around here.

599
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:03,534
Third time.

600
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,236
It must be old hat.

601
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,722
- You're gonna be fine, Peggy.
- I look at you and I think

602
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:28,904
"I want what he has."

603
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:30,510
- Really?

604
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,612
You have everything,

605
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:38,839
and so much of it.

606
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,251
I suppose that's probably true.

607
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,800
What do you want me to say?

608
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,920
I don't think I could have been
any clearer.

609
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:09,341
You see what's been going on here
the last six months?

610
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:24,443
What if this is my time?

611
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,423
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies' room.

612
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,111
You want to join me?

613
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:56,598
- Did you tell Don about duck?
- That's none of your business.

614
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,659
Sure. They hear you're
shopping around, they'll want you more.

615
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,601
But me, I'm sharing
my job with Kenny.

616
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,177
I'm already redundant.

617
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:05,536
You have relationships
with your clients. That's leverage.

618
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:08,275
- Did you say something?
- It's my decision, Pete.

619
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,149
If it isn't Martin Luther King.
I should drop kick you off the roof.

620
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:40,084
Admiral television has
no interest in becoming

621
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:42,434
a colored television company.

622
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:43,853
But they are.

623
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:47,204
It seems illogical to me
that they would reject an opportunity

624
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:48,779
to make more money.

625
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,330
- Then again, I'm in advertising.
- This is a sensitive issue.

626
00:42:53,455 --> 00:42:56,765
- Businesses hate that.
- Let me put it in account terms.

627
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,703
Are you aware of the number of hand jobs
I'm gonna have to give?

628
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:01,453
Am I being taken off the account?

629
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,663
I'm going to have to pretend
I had you killed!

630
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,707
Sales are flat.
I had to do something.

631
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,986
I don't know if anyone's ever told you
that half the time

632
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,493
this business comes down
to "I don't like that guy."

633
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,174
Are we done with the flogging?

634
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,991
It's never as good
as you think it's gonna be.

635
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:23,767
If I may. Burt, Roger,

636
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:28,355
it does seem as though there's money
to be made in the negro market.

637
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,981
Obviously not with Admiral,

638
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:34,110
but I don't think it would be wrong
of us to pursue it

639
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:35,428
in some way.

640
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:36,954
Really?

641
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:39,407
I've just moved here.

642
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:42,806
I'm a stranger in a strange land,

643
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:47,082
but I can tell you that there's
definitely something going on.

644
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,280
We'll look into it.

645
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:52,587
You can go.

646
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,079
- We're here!
- She's here!

647
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,556
Welcome welcome.

648
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,257
- Mommy!
- Careful.

649
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:55,266
Here, let me take him.

650
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:01,893
I missed you so much.

651
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,294
Wait till you see your fridge.

652
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:07,955
If there's a power outage,

653
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,623
you can feed the entire street
for a month.

654
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,580
Hi, baby. I'm your brother Bobby.

655
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:18,043
Remember: you have to be careful.

656
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,481
How was it?

657
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:21,392
You know.

658
00:45:23,032 --> 00:45:24,232
Was all a fog.

659
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:28,099
You're making a mistake
not forcing carla to stay.

660
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:31,269
She's been away from her family,

661
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,439
- and I can manage.
- I know some girls.

662
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,984
- You want something to eat?
- Sure.

663
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,985
I've got it. Come on.
