1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,918
We're making you Head of Accounts.

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,587
- <i>Previously on Mad Men.</i>
- Spectacular.

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,382
- Excuse me.
- You're now Head of Accounts.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,385
You've been engaged from 2 months
and you're not making wedding plans.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,013
I had your baby and I gave it away.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,349
I don't know
why I pick the wrong boys.

7
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:18,059
My father has a stroke.

8
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,937
Lord knows Don could afford to build him
a house in his backyard if he wanted to.

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,730
Stop calling other people money.

10
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,399
- He's leaving me.
- I want you to be my wife.

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,027
It's business going on
and I'm not invited.

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,356
Synchro: Hutch

13
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,473
Mad Men S03E02
- Love Among The Ruins -

14
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,028
Is there more? I love her.

15
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,024
I saw Susan Watson
do it on Broadway.

16
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,477
She was great,
but she didn't have that.

17
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:19,680
It's not going to be her, but they want
that scene frame for frame, as they say.

18
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,214
So something about how desperate
she is for a Pepsi?

19
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:27,200
It's for Pepsi, but it's not for Pepsi.
It's called Patio,

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,441
and it's a dieter's kind of Pepsi
to help women reduce.

21
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:33,169
It's Pepsi's diet-rite cola,

22
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:35,463
and there's claims
that their lawyers went over...

23
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,863
Calories, et cetera,

24
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,838
if we do it right, we land Patio.

25
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,328
And if we land Patio,
I'll be at lunch with Pepsi.

26
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,791
I think Pete Campbell
just broke a sweat.

27
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,332
I'm coming to casting.

28
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,464
We're going right to casting?

29
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,801
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

30
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,376
I understand why you like this,
but it's not for you.

31
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,215
I'm the one who would
be buying Patio.

32
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,872
You're not fat anymore.

33
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:58,719
Thank you.

34
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:01,965
Let's assume we can't talk them
out of the name

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,230
and let's assume we can get
a girl who can match

36
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,310
Ann Margret's ability
to be 25 and act 14.

37
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,784
Is that what she's doing?

38
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:11,275
Is it just a knock-off?

39
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,411
Are we allowed
to make fun of it, at least?

40
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,159
She's fun and sexy.
Don't be a prude.

41
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,368
Would you say that to me?

42
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,658
It's sexy, and it's what they want.

43
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,327
Clients don't always
know what's best.

44
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,491
When we land them, you can
start talking to them that way.

45
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,153
Pick it up.

46
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,367
Bobby, back away from the stove.

47
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,794
We're out of Melba toast.

48
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,054
Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal.
That baby's gonna weigh a pound.

49
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:44,183
Carla must have had some,

50
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,642
because I would have
thrown the box away.

51
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,238
Are we gonna collect the whole set?

52
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,939
I thought you didn't mind
her doing the legwork.

53
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,277
You didn't need
a decorator last time.

54
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,413
I'd like to feel like
I'm paying for something.

55
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:58,340
These are $3 a piece, you know.

56
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:00,554
And I can't really judge
by a picture.

57
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,783
I'm late.

58
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,779
We should really spend
a day in Tarrytown.

59
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,208
It'd be so easy.

60
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,457
- No.
- Those stores smell bad.

61
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:11,746
We are going to Tarrytown...

62
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,729
And you're going to stare at
some antique chair for so long

63
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,510
the buttons are
gonna seem interesting,

64
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,205
and then we'll go to carvel.

65
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,630
See you tonight.

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,349
What are you doing?

67
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:30,603
I hope you received the package showing
our campaign to ease the way

68
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,762
for the Ravenswood
nuclear power facility.

69
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:35,042
Kinsey was responsible for that.

70
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,654
Almost a year and nary
a peep of opposition.

71
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,145
It was very impressive.

72
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,488
I've told Paul

73
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,372
that you're facing an onslaught
of negative public opinion

74
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:46,904
in your attempt to demolish the
Pennsylvania railroad station this year

75
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,205
and replace it with the new
Madison Square Garden.

76
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,327
We should've torn the damn thing down
during the newspaper strike.

77
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,032
No one would have noticed.

78
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,273
Now let's take a look at
the landscape, as it were.

79
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,684
"Save Penn station."

80
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:05,757
"Save Penn station."

81
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,476
"Rape on 34th street."

82
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,076
"Stop fascism!"

83
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,483
"How to kill a city."

84
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:21,639
"Architects' inhumanity to architects
surpasses understanding."

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,741
"The new design is also ambitious,
pedestrian and dull."

86
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,995
Ada Louise Huxtable is
as green as that folder.

87
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,015
People know that she's an angry
woman with a big mouth.

88
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,640
Who writes for
"The New York Times."

89
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,765
I don't care if she wrote
for the 10 commandments.

90
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,305
She's trying to sell papers
doing what they always do...

91
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,892
Making people miserable.

92
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:43,141
My great-great-grandfather, Silustagman,
would have turned his boat around

93
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:46,512
if he had known that this city would
one day be filled with crybabies.

94
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:51,265
So what's your best weapon
against lunatics?

95
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,602
15 stories,

96
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:55,765
vaulted ceilings, pink milford
granite columns...

97
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,025
I don't think it's crazy to be attached
to a <i>beaux-arts</i> masterpiece

98
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,235
through which Teddy Roosevelt
came and went.

99
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,322
I've met the opposition.
I know crazy.

100
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,801
Do you know where the greatest
roman ruins are?

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,955
They're in Greece, Spain,

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,455
because the romans tore
theirs all down.

103
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,375
They took apart the Coliseum
to build their outhouses.

104
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:19,128
This is the Coliseum.
Have you seen the plans?

105
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,005
In "The New York Times."

106
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:25,445
- Do you have a problem, buddy?
- He's looking for an angle.

107
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:29,399
You know those snide ad men
you see in the movies?

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,330
Right here.

109
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,390
I've got a mailbox full
of death threats from beatniks

110
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:37,516
like him who'd rather
live in a teepee.

111
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:40,566
This is the greatest city in the world.
If you don't like it, leave.

112
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:48,783
We'll let you know.

113
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,330
You have no problems with an atom plant
on the east river, but this bothers you?

114
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,684
It's Penn station.

115
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,779
This city has no memory.

116
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,504
Out with the old, in with the new
who says that's a good idea?

117
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm going to have
to talk to Don about this.

118
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:06,955
Don't do that.

119
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:09,962
Look.

120
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:13,432
Now they'll trust me more
when I help them.

121
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,502
Do you ever listen to yourself?

122
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:19,275
I hate you. You know that.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,618
Other than Wilma Flintstone,
I haven't seen anyone carry so well.

124
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,914
It's smoke and mirrors.
I've busted plenty of seams.

125
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,655
It makes me optimistic.

126
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,320
Greg has made it perfectly clear
that come July 1

127
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:33,661
and he's chief resident,
I'd better watch out.

128
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,531
Hello, Mrs. Draper.

129
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,516
Can you get Mrs. Draper
a glass of water?

130
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,293
Why don't you tell me first
how long I'm going to be here?

131
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,391
What's so urgent?
London Bridge falling down?

132
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,392
In a manner of speaking.

133
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,582
I appreciate you stopping by.

134
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,842
Didn't you just call us
to your office?

135
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,796
Yes. I thought it best
if I told you in person.

136
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:58,477
I just heard from London. We've been
sacked by Campbell soup, Great Britain.

137
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,705
I don't want to have to walk down here
every time we lose an account.

138
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,626
This is an advertising agency.
I'll wear out the carpet.

139
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,076
It's not so much
the account we lost

140
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,454
as the account we failed to gain.

141
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,050
So now B.B.D.O. has
all of Campbell's soup?

142
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,055
Why didn't we have
a meeting with them?

143
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,962
Perhaps I should drag Burt Peterson
in and fire him again?

144
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,716
Obviously Don would've
loved the shot.

145
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,958
How did this slip
through the cracks?

146
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,328
I don't usually set meetings,
I attend them.

147
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:34,597
If this is where we wanted to end up,
we all did everything perfectly.

148
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:38,507
You ever get three sheets to the wind
and try that thing on?

149
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,531
<i>Mrs. Pryce is here.</i>

150
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,381
Nothing to fret about as long as
there's new business.

151
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:46,982
Five minutes?

152
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,143
It's definitely side to side.

153
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,019
Is that a boy or a girl?

154
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,049
I'll call my mother.

155
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,832
Look.

156
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,756
Princess Grace just
swallowed a basketball.

157
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,130
- How are you, Roger?
- It's not hard to adjust to happiness.

158
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:09,896
Shall we?

159
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,958
Good night, Mrs. Harris.

160
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,908
I'm in a foul mood.

161
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,601
Chateau Fafite Rothschild'49.

162
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,028
I'm very impressed
that you have this.

163
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,415
Not bad at that.

164
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:49,046
- Where are you living?
- We have a finished flat in sutt place.

165
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:51,757
Three bedrooms, spectacular view
of the river.

166
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,053
And we're near the U.N.,
so there's plenty of africans.

167
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:02,977
Like the Bordeaux grape,
may we all get better with time.

168
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:08,828
This is delicious.

169
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:13,404
Rebecca was curious if you knew
anything about schools.

170
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,632
In the city,
I'm a little out of touch.

171
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,570
How long have you been together?

172
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:21,212
- 10 years.
- Nine years.

173
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,247
15 for us.

174
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,506
Do you miss London?

175
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:30,881
God, yes.

176
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,332
But what we lost in London
we gained in insects.

177
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,932
J. Walter Thompson is
opening an office in Caracas.

178
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:44,025
I don't know if the ladies want
to talk about that.

179
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:45,978
No, of course not.

180
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,570
The cookie.

181
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:51,321
Brilliant.

182
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,756
Look, I didn't want to be there
any more than you did.

183
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,950
It was just the cherry
on top of my sundae.

184
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:05,391
What?

185
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:10,262
Tell me now and not three seconds
after I've dozed off.

186
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:15,071
I've been trying to get
my father on the phone.

187
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:22,065
Of course I called william and,
again, something's wrong.

188
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,915
Another stroke?

189
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,184
Gloria left him.

190
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,777
- Can you blame her?
- Yes, I can blame her.

191
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:33,073
She came into his life,

192
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,898
he suddenly takes ill
and she abandons him.

193
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:39,365
Maybe she realized
he's a son of a bitch.

194
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,782
Don, I'm worried about him.

195
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:46,284
He doesn't sound right,

196
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,027
and I can't take a car trip now.

197
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:54,589
I think William and Judy should
bring him up this weekend.

198
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,174
Great, more antiques.

199
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,885
It's spring break.
It'll be nice for the kids.

200
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:02,008
Those girls are a nightmare.

201
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,491
They'll leave
by Saturday at the latest.

202
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,621
Why did you even bother asking me?

203
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,371
She's really kicking.

204
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:27,497
<i>Mr. Sterling, your family is here.</i>

205
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:29,412
Send them in.

206
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:34,044
If it isn't fall bride.

207
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,342
- Where's Brooks?
- He'll be along.

208
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,553
- Would anyone like anything? Coffee...
- It's 10:30.

209
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,141
Sherry if you have it.

210
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:53,082
I told Brooks to come late.
I don't want him to be embarrassed.

211
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,291
By what, that I'm paying
for anything?

212
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,518
You just tell him...

213
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,580
That's the way it's done.

214
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,896
No, Roger, it's about Jane.

215
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,457
What about her?

216
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:06,332
It was her idea
to take you to Dior.

217
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,345
Why haven't you returned her calls?

218
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,456
You're hurting her feelings.

219
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,671
I know what you think.

220
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:16,893
You think it's so uncomfortable that
I won't even bring it up.

221
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,701
You're being very dramatic for a girl
who didn't want a wedding at all.

222
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,717
Do you want me to say it?
Do I have to say it?

223
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,189
Say what exactly?

224
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:25,645
I suggested to Margaret
a compromise.

225
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,975
You and Jane host your own table
and I'll be at the Hargroves'.

226
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,751
So you get <i>T in-laws</i>
and I get Siberia.

227
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,774
Are you worried about an odd number?
Because I'll get your mother a date.

228
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,776
- I have a date.
- Who?

229
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:42,195
- Bruce Pike.
- What does that old Saddlebag want?

230
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:45,272
I didn't want to go
to her wedding, but I did.

231
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,834
The least she can do
is not come to mine.

232
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,787
- Not come?
- That's why I suggested a compromise.

233
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,646
You're not even giving
Jane a chance.

234
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,390
Seeing her on my wedding day
is gonna ruin it.

235
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,963
She's young enough to be my sister.
How does it look?

236
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:02,174
- Sweetheart.
- Brooks! Thank God.

237
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,708
Mom.

238
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,644
- How are you, sir?
- Not great, Brooks.

239
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:09,769
Not great.

240
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,227
- Can I get you something?
- No.

241
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,834
That's okay. I'll have yours.

242
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,481
We're not married
anymore, you know.

243
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,089
I like the silver and the bells.

244
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:26,750
Go with the bells.

245
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,220
November 23rd.

246
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:30,895
I'll tell Jane.

247
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:38,503
<i>Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

248
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:43,584
Send him in.

249
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,776
Your wife is charming.

250
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,390
She lifted Rebecca's
spirits inestimably.

251
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm glad to hear it.
They really hit it off.

252
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,023
I hate to send you
into the Lion's den,

253
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,233
but I think it best
you take the gentleman

254
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,709
from Madison Square Garden
to a nice lunch today.

255
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,158
Peter and Paul rubbed him
very much the wrong way.

256
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:07,657
I told you before
Roger's the lion tamer.

257
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,367
Roger will join as well.

258
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,082
It will help if you tell me
who these people are.

259
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,647
All I could secure
was Edgar Raffit,

260
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:16,895
vice president
of Madison Square Garden,

261
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,751
and he's irate.

262
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,503
What does he want?

263
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:24,298
A <i>Cyrano De Bergerac</i> to make
New York fall in love with him.

264
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,636
- Today?
- Do you have plans?

265
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,783
Have Campbell send over the folder.

266
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:44,568
Wild indians.

267
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,530
They've been cooped up
since woodbridge.

268
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,532
I fixed some lunch.

269
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,748
Cold roast chicken
or I have cold cuts.

270
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:55,483
We went to Pat's steaks.

271
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,330
I got you a half.

272
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,044
- Have you all already eaten?
- No, we waited.

273
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,849
I even got Gloria
a chicken parmesan.

274
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:07,883
Great.

275
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,288
We'll mail it to her.

276
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:14,140
She's in Boca Raton.
She's not coming back.

277
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:21,063
He understands completely.
He's just playing it up.

278
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,862
- How was the drive, daddy?
- In the Lincoln?

279
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,489
You should take your Coumadin
with your sandwich.

280
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,072
So I said to them,
"it's so crowded in here

281
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,810
"I feel like I'm on the subway."

282
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,296
I've never seen anyone
like you on the train.

283
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:47,757
My husband won't let me.
It's a figure of speech.

284
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:51,890
Have a seat and I'll let Mr. Pryce
know that you're here.

285
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,654
Sorry about that. I got tied up.

286
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:11,636
What else do you have to do today?

287
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:14,750
- What else do you have to do all week?
- I barely made it here.

288
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,138
Ginger presses the buzzer,
says "your family's here."

289
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,263
Sounds silly.

290
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,513
Gibson, up.

291
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,225
Like that's gonna help.

292
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,762
To my knees, Don.
They're bringing me to my knees.

293
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,047
Sorry to hear that.

294
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,925
I made my bed,
I should lie in it, right?

295
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,703
Your words, not mine.

296
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:42,042
Like it's not hard enough losing
my little girl to that kid.

297
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:45,849
I've got her mother pouring
poison in her ear.

298
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,596
There's a land grab going on.

299
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:55,688
I blame Mona.

300
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,234
All of a sudden, I could give
two craps about that wedding.

301
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,706
All I want to do is win.

302
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:02,994
Gentlemen.

303
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,346
A pleasure to meet you.
Roger Sterling.

304
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,597
- Ed Raffit.
- Our creative Director Don Draper.

305
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,218
Have a seat, please.
Let's get you fixed up.

306
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,849
- I only have a minute.
- Edgar, please.

307
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,665
Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.

308
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,897
I understand one of our copywriters
took a yetta wallenda-

309
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:30,192
Sized misstep.

310
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,034
The girl, the tightrope walker.

311
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,897
They got her off the sidewalk
with a hose last week.

312
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,148
The point is we completely
understand your problem.

313
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,473
All we want to know
is how we can help.

314
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,498
You're supposed to tell me.

315
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:48,336
I've done all I can. Don?

316
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,592
In the interest of time,
you want to demolish Penn station

317
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,100
and New York hates it.

318
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,136
Not all of New York,
a vocal minority.

319
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:59,286
Can they stop it?

320
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:02,183
I think all the hubbub is making
it unpleasant for...

321
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,185
But they can't stop it, can they?

322
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,023
Why do you people insist on making us
sound like villains?

323
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,923
Your concern over public opinion
shows a guilty conscience.

324
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:15,099
Now what good is that serving you

325
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:17,439
if what is to be done
is already underway?

326
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:18,973
Leave those.

327
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:22,661
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,

328
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,079
bleu cheese, bacon.

329
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,442
So let's say I don'thave
a guilty conscience.

330
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,377
Good.

331
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,812
And let's also say that change
is neither good or bad,

332
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:34,312
it simply is.

333
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,102
It can be greeted
with terror or joy...

334
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:38,677
A tantrum that says

335
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,784
"I want it the way it was"
or a dance that says

336
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,183
"look. It's something new."

337
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:46,936
Would you draw the line at 50%?

338
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,036
I'm not drawing a line at all.

339
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,851
P.R. people understand this,
but they can never execute it.

340
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:55,048
If you don't like
what is being said,

341
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:57,998
change the conversation.

342
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,707
What is that conversation?

343
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,360
I was in California.

344
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,263
Everything is new and it's clean.
The people are filled with hope.

345
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,220
New York city is in decay.

346
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,710
Madison Square Garden

347
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,144
is the beginning
of a new city on the hill.

348
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,230
- Just like that?
- It's true, isn't it?

349
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,139
If I were to come to you,

350
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,687
I don't want
that kid on my account...

351
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:40,489
The communist, the radical.

352
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,296
I will handle it personally.

353
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,432
Grandpa Gene is gonna watch
his program now.

354
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,500
I just want to catch
the end of the game.

355
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:55,382
Move.

356
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,605
Daddy seems well.
He has an appetite.

357
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,847
He eats constantly.

358
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:18,109
When I found out Gloria was gone,
I was hoping he ate her.

359
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:20,779
How could you not know about that?

360
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,074
I went by, but he lied to me.

361
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,885
Then finally, when I let myself in,
he went bananas.

362
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,448
He's ashamed.

363
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:31,323
- Judy can get through to him.
- He's down in the dumps,

364
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:33,609
but he seems very clear-headed.

365
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,869
That's not true, Judy,
and you know it.

366
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,320
He's angry and he's in and out.

367
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:43,044
There is this place...

368
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,809
The Parker home.

369
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,156
It's midway between us
in New Brunswick.

370
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,832
And what happens there?

371
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,269
He lives there.

372
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,922
It's got everything, plus doctors.

373
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,432
It's expensive,

374
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:59,647
but I thought maybe
we could sell our house.

375
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:02,280
That would give him
enough to live on.

376
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:04,358
That's very generous.

377
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,573
Do you think he belongs in a home?

378
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,789
- Betty, I know I don't get a vote.
- Neither does Don.

379
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,473
All you care about is the house.

380
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,761
You want to walk in there,
see daddy on the bottom of the stairs

381
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,681
and have his last words
be "take the house."

382
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,988
Fine, Betts.

383
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,260
What's the solution?

384
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,886
Those homes are for people who don't
have families.

385
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,104
He's a lonely old man
and he's not well.

386
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,799
He's your father.

387
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,966
Thanks for
the ritzy accommodations.

388
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,825
You're an army man, gene.

389
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:10,514
Drop your socks and grab something.

390
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:27,886
Lights out at 8:15.
I'm impressed.

391
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:29,825
I wish you would hang
your coat up downstairs.

392
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,409
It's covered with soot.

393
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:40,778
How bad is he?

394
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,088
He's not the problem.

395
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,287
What am I saying?
He's the whole problem...

396
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:48,677
That and William's
never-ending bullshit.

397
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:50,554
What now?

398
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,137
He wants to put him
in an old folks home.

399
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:56,936
I understand it's not ideal,
but it is the next logical step.

400
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,063
Don, he just wants the house.

401
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,077
He keeps nailing himself
to the cross.

402
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,151
For all I know, Judy's pushing him.

403
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,890
Cut it out.

404
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,212
What do you want to do?

405
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,459
How can he talk that way to me
in the condition I'm in?

406
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:25,639
- Do you want anything?
- Just throw it on the chair

407
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,964
and stay here.

408
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,075
Be careful.

409
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,078
I'm fine.

410
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,408
It's so funny... How she is.

411
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,365
My father and
her fought constantly.

412
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,963
She never remembers that part.

413
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,640
Family is important to her.

414
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,215
I care about family.

415
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:09,678
You know, Don had nobody
at their wedding.

416
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:11,134
Nobody at all.

417
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,764
Why can't we just move in with him?

418
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,439
I'll take care of him.

419
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:20,580
It's bad enough to work for him.

420
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,502
I'm a 30-year-old man.

421
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:26,115
I don't want to have somebody tell me
I have the wrong tie on.

422
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,738
Raffit is sending over
every piece of paper

423
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,432
they have on the new garden.

424
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,308
He wants you to see
these new drawings.

425
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,431
Apparently they're
right out of "Metropolis."

426
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:57,183
- Did he talk about television?
- I have a meeting on the books.

427
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:59,119
He talked a lot about radio...

428
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,309
And Kinsey.

429
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:01,870
You're gonna have to keep
a low profile on this,

430
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,369
but it doesn't mean
you're not working.

431
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:05,498
<i>Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

432
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:11,244
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

433
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,120
Did you come to treat us to
a little new-business lunch?

434
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:16,872
May I speak with you
in private, Don?

435
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,728
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

436
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,433
Bad news, I'm afraid.

437
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:31,433
I just got off
the phone with London.

438
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,160
There's a problem
with Madison Square Garden.

439
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:38,032
- Did their check bounce already?
- Unfortunately, there's a conflict.

440
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,559
Did you tell them it's a stadium
in the middle of New York city?

441
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:44,014
- It's one of a kind.
- They know exactly what it is...

442
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,791
A project...
And they told us to turn it down.

443
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,295
- I'm confused.
- It's a question of economics.

444
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,187
Servicing Madison Square Garden
will requirean account man,

445
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,753
at least two copywriters,
two artists, an ombudsman

446
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,263
to city hall... All against
200,000 in billings.

447
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,724
- That's for right now.
- Precisely.

448
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,269
From what I understand,
groundbreaking is two years away.

449
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:09,444
Madison Square Garden is
our way into the world's fair,

450
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:13,483
the largest trade show in history.
Plus there's the garden itself...

451
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,221
Hotels, concerts, sports.

452
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:20,273
- This could mean 30 years of business.
- They're not interested.

453
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:21,934
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,359
You told me to go out
and get this account.

455
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,933
I did. I did my job.

456
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:29,676
And now you're telling me
it's all for nothing

457
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,980
because you forgot to check
with your boss first?

458
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:34,623
- Who's running this place?
- I know this is difficult.

459
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,886
I take full responsibility.

460
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:39,342
Why the hell did you buy us
in the first place?

461
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:43,059
I don't know.

462
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,820
Tell Mr. Campbell
Madison Square Garden is dead.

463
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:00,823
- Do you have a second?
- Can it wait?

464
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,562
Sal sent up the storyboards.

465
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:11,997
What is this?

466
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,621
It's Patio,
the diet drink for Pepsi.

467
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,871
Yes. Everyone wants a drink
that sounds like a floor.

468
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:21,313
- This is chinese.
- It's all one shot,

469
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:23,249
like the beginning
of "bye bye birdie."

470
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,931
- I haven't seen it.
- Well, this is an Ann Margret type.

471
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,391
Fine.

472
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:31,479
You really haven't seen it?
You see everything.

473
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:55,886
We have a few versions of a song,

474
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:59,062
and the boys are very excited
about finding this girl.

475
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:00,187
I'm sure.

476
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:03,339
Don't you find her voice shrill?

477
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:07,248
Just throw yourself at the camera.

478
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:08,687
It's pure.

479
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:11,623
It makes your heart hurt.

480
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,230
No one seems to care
that it speaks to men,

481
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,150
not the people
that drink diet drinks.

482
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:20,236
What do the geniuses at Patio want?

483
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:25,491
Maybe we should be talking about how
this is better than coffee or dexedrine.

484
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,048
It's not about
making women feel fat.

485
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:29,373
This is

486
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:32,393
"Look how happy
I am that I drink Patio."

487
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,667
"I'm young, excited
and desperate for a man."

488
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,298
I don't mind fantasies,
but shouldn't it be a female one?

489
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,436
I know you understand
how this works.

490
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:44,510
Men want her.
Women want to be her.

491
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,998
- Even if that's true...
- It is.

492
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,599
I'm sorry if
that makes you uncomfortable.

493
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:54,718
You know if we were
making a movie or a play,

494
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:56,813
we'd be embarrassed
to do this. It's phony.

495
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:02,236
You're not an artist, Peggy.
You solve problems.

496
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,826
Leave some tools in your toolbox.

497
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:16,014
Could you hold that?

498
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,688
- Heading home?
- Yes.

499
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:36,270
Let me ask you something.
You're a young girl.

500
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:37,940
Excuse me?

501
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,133
You're the only one around here

502
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:42,284
who doesn't have that
stupid look on her face.

503
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,763
What does that mean?

504
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,940
What would your father have to do

505
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,473
for you to not want him
at your wedding?

506
00:31:50,483 --> 00:31:52,115
My father passed away.

507
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:57,628
It's so crowded in here.
I feel like I'm on the subway.

508
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,689
Where's your drink?

509
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,084
Don't worry about this.
It's under control.

510
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:35,221
Hey, where's mom?

511
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,570
She's upstairs.

512
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,319
I'm going out
for a bucket of chicken.

513
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:53,894
What's the matter?

514
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:57,620
- I'm a horrible daughter.
- No, you're not.

515
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,984
William says these are the options:

516
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:01,456
we put him in a home

517
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:04,557
or they move in with him
and Judy is his nurse.

518
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,963
- Judy.
- William says?

519
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,548
He's probably right.

520
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:17,345
I'll go get
the chicken in a minute.

521
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:22,347
Can I speak to you a minute?

522
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,285
- What year is this from?
- I don't care.

523
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,038
Look, Don,

524
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:43,698
we're all upset.

525
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,148
One thing I've learned
from this... don't get old.

526
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:50,435
- About your father.
- It's a real jackpot.

527
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:53,197
He always said he didn't want
to be a burden,

528
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,245
and yet here we are.

529
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,046
This is what's going to happen.

530
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,322
You're going to explain
to your sister and your wife

531
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,520
that we have reached
an understanding.

532
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:08,696
You are going to support
your father financially

533
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:11,722
and I am going to take him
into my house.

534
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:14,112
His house will remain untouched.

535
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,073
I appreciate the advice, Don.

536
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,993
I'll take it under consideration.

537
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,170
You're gonna tell your sister
that this is what you want.

538
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:25,374
We'll pretend that you did
the right thing on your own.

539
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:28,420
- He's my father!
- And he's in my home.

540
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:32,560
I want you to leave tonight
and I want you to leave the Lincoln.

541
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:35,739
- I can't have him here without a car.
- Are you kidding me?

542
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,471
How are we supposed to get home?

543
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,221
New York Central...

544
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,721
broadway limited from Penn station.

545
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:47,970
It leaves in two hours.

546
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:51,084
You want him?

547
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,234
You got him.

548
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:47,873
Dad, we have to talk.

549
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:49,500
I could eat.

550
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:53,087
Daddy, William has
something to say.

551
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:57,621
All of us...

552
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,434
We've been trying to figure out
a way we can help you live better.

553
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,637
I'd be doing all right
if people left me alone.

554
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,872
Daddy...

555
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:08,172
Don and I want you
to live here with us.

556
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,814
Honey, I'm not that blue.

557
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,599
Just for a while.

558
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:16,943
I think you need a little vacation.

559
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:24,059
So the animals are running the zoo?

560
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:27,529
We're not selling the house,
and you're gonna have your car.

561
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,446
The plans, the plans,
the plans you make.

562
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:40,386
You know you want
to get out of town.

563
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:42,872
You'll be with the kids.

564
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:46,323
Betty is a better cook.
You always say that.

565
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,855
Well, I should've been
the first to go.

566
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:57,435
Daddy, don't talk like that.

567
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:02,036
We should go pack.

568
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:04,833
Girls, start getting
your things together.

569
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,502
It's nice, right?

570
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:17,424
It's called a Stinger.

571
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,160
- I don't know what's in it.
- It's delicious.

572
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:29,599
I'm graduating from
Brooklyn college next month.

573
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,436
What are you studying?

574
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:34,023
- What?
- What are you studying?

575
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,750
Do you want one?

576
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,149
I'm afraid you're
gonna bite my hand.

577
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,125
I'm sorry.

578
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,205
I just need to eat.

579
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:45,910
My mom says I'm still growing.

580
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,801
I've got to work on my manners.

581
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:54,590
I started pre-law,
but switched to engineering...

582
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:57,000
- More jobs.
- Really?

583
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,195
Those are so different.

584
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,954
You've gotta figure if we're all gonna
be replaced by machines,

585
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,187
might as well be a guy
that makes them, right?

586
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:06,512
Or you could just become a robot.

587
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:09,351
Are you in school?

588
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:11,249
I work at an ad agency,

589
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:12,374
Manhattan.

590
00:39:13,823 --> 00:39:16,397
I don't know how you girls
do all that typing.

591
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,491
And I work for a jerk.

592
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,223
We're hitting the road.
You got cab fare?

593
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,312
What are you talking about?
I live around the corner.

594
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:28,125
That's right. He does.

595
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:55,543
Do you have,

596
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,963
you know...

597
00:39:58,671 --> 00:39:59,521
What?

598
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,175
... a trojan?

599
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:21,737
I can't.

600
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,362
I can't.

601
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:36,053
Jeez.

602
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,207
It's getting pretty late.

603
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:47,164
There are other things we could do.

604
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:18,149
Did you hear that?

605
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,993
The heat is on. We've gotta
get rid of this stuff.

606
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:42,988
You got anything else around,
go flush it.

607
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:30,090
You're leaving?

608
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,177
I have to work tomorrow.

609
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,721
- You want to get breakfast?
- It's the middle of the night.

610
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:39,804
Where do you work again?

611
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,279
Madison Avenue.

612
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:48,067
Well, you know, I hang out
at that place a lot.

613
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,816
It's the bottom one.

614
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,429
Thanks.

615
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,641
This was fun.

616
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:25,139
Parents, friends and family,

617
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:27,272
I'd like to welcome
you all to field day.

618
00:43:28,428 --> 00:43:31,234
I hope you can appreciate
how hard the children

619
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:33,778
have prepared
in all kinds of weather.

620
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:44,623
"The tradition of the maypole
dates back over 500 years,"

621
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:47,942
"and is celebrated
all over the world."

622
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,952
"We erected our maypole
for ossining's"

623
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:54,133
"sesquicentennial."

624
00:43:55,058 --> 00:43:57,053
"We dance around the pole"

625
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,806
"in a timeless celebration"

626
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,265
"of the renewal of springtime."

627
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,691
Okay, ribbons up.

628
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:23,823
Daddy!

629
00:45:23,948 --> 00:45:26,013
- Did you see me dance?
- I did.

630
00:45:26,138 --> 00:45:27,388
You were great.

631
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,523
Cindy's dad wants
to take our picture.

632
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,737
Say "cheese!"

633
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:01,948
- How was your morning, Mr. Draper?
- Fine.

634
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:10,478
- Do you want to talk about Pampers?
- What you got?
