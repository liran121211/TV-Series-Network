1
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:20,695
I don't care if it's windy or rainy,
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail

2
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,113
If it's laid right--

3
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,682
Except that one.

4
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,620
No flashing around the
chimney-- that's gonna cost 'em.

5
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,927
Go around!

6
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,636
Now I'm gonna push it up

7
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,172
To 25mph. That's what
we're allowed to do here.

8
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,109
You've gotta really pay attention.

9
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,255
15 minutes of news and
nothing about the holy father.

10
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,858
He's still dead, ma.

11
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,577
<i>The shower cap pulled up?
- Yes.</i>

12
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,963
Piece of junk.

13
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,501
If you want, I'll have gerry
come over and fix your shower.

14
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,256
It was fixed, but I think ronnie
the super sneaks in and breaks it.

15
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,641
For all I know, he's going
through my things right now.

16
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,693
You don't like getting a
little bit of attention?

17
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,813
Anita, this man does not
look the way you want him to.

18
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,850
I'd offer you a room, but since
mom moved in, I don't have it.

19
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,637
I want to move to manhattan.

20
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,689
Really?

21
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,090
It's so far away.

22
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,892
It is far,

23
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,361
And I commute almost two
hours total every day,

24
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:44,963
Five days a week.

25
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,714
That's an extra week of work each month.

26
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,433
My goodness, I never thought of that.

27
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,236
Pegs, the rents there--
they're outrageous.

28
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,607
I know, but I'm already spending
a fortune between subway fare,

29
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,309
Cab fare on late
nights, pantyhose--

30
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:01,780
If I can't find a newspaper, the
cane on the seats destroys them.

31
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:05,433
And it'll be easy with
that savings and a roommate.

32
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,236
Jeez louise, you've been
really thinking about this.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,122
Ma! That's not good for it!

34
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:16,094
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to manhattan?

35
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:21,165
Are you going to be one of those girls?

36
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,903
I am one of those girls.

37
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,424
Well, ho-ho, I've observed
your wishes for secrecy,

38
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,209
But now is the time.

39
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:34,729
Gentlemen...

40
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,049
Imagine the perfect mixture

41
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,352
Of athletics, spectacle and speed.

42
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,989
Jai alai.

43
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,125
Jai alai is like handball,

44
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,294
Only you fling the ball and catch the ball

45
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,346
With this basket thing.

46
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,632
It's more complicated
than that... And dangerous.

47
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,201
<i>I'll leave the loose-leaf,</i>

48
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,536
But it shows the way jai
alai attendance is growing.

49
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,439
In seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.

50
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:03,908
Go ahead, you can laugh,

51
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,178
But it's got the same fingerprint
as baseball, only better.

52
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,281
A special stadium called a fronton

53
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,617
And you can sit real close, which is a thrill

54
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:15,220
Because the ball goes 175mph.

55
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,089
And it's got patxi.

56
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,658
He's babe ruth, only handsome.

57
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,513
This is patxi.

58
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,034
<i>I was looking for boxers, but
I bought his contract instead.</i>

59
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,736
He's the greatest player in the world.

60
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,471
Mel ferrer.

61
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,741
I'm terrified of him
catching balls in the face.

62
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,079
So let's say

63
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,347
There's enough money.

64
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,351
How would you chop it up?

65
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, most of it's going
to end up in television.

66
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,672
Perfect, because I want a tv show.

67
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,724
- A sports show?
- Did you see patxi?

68
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,027
You don't see him flying around the world,

69
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,829
Solving crimes and banging broads?

70
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,983
Harry has excellent
relationships with the networks.

71
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,435
Well, it'll probably have to be abc.

72
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,337
No no.

73
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,623
<i>I want to be on all the networks,</i>

74
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,841
Like when the president addresses the nation.

75
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,811
Tuesday night, 8:30-9:00,

76
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,614
All three networks--
the same show.

77
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,184
No one's ever done it.

78
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,970
Because...

79
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:25,623
That's true.

80
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,928
How about a star-studded

81
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,648
<i>Big musical special with a jai alai match.</i>

82
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:37,135
- Desi arnaz.
- What else you got?

83
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,771
- Well, there's print.
- Women's magazines.

84
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:42,323
A glamorous night in miami

85
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,343
- With a free admission.
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

86
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:49,380
And of course newspapers are key, but you
can't limit yourself to less than 10 markets.

87
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,115
This is impressive.

88
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,537
- Don't get up.
- Horace, this is don draper.

89
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,506
I told you he'd be stopping by.

90
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,257
Don't let me interrupt.

91
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,427
So far for the jai alai campaign:

92
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,696
<i>Sterling cooper will
produce an adventure program,</i>

93
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,248
Starring your handsome fella,

94
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,335
- A musical spectacular-- - on all
three networks and it has to be in color.

95
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,404
CBS doesn't have color.

96
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:19,143
Fine. I'd like to get the
ladies' magazines in color

97
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,030
And maybe a color page in the Sunday paper.

98
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,648
What about radio?

99
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,817
You'll have to take radio the way it is.

100
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,104
I don't think it's worth anyone's time

101
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,373
Unless you're willing to commit to at least

102
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,793
$1 million to start.

103
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,529
Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.

104
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,201
Well, as they used to
say at the freshmen mixer,

105
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,887
"when you get a yes, you go home."

106
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,972
Only, humps, you never got one.

107
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,629
Listen, draper, I'd love to buy you dinner,

108
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:57,081
- Run some slogans by
you. - Actually, ho-ho,

109
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,633
We buy you dinner.

110
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:08,042
That was fun.

111
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,712
I'm going to have to buy
campbell a case of something.

112
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:13,514
Patxi.

113
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,067
During the depression, I saw somebody throw

114
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,902
A loaf of bread off the back of a truck.

115
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:20,088
It was more dignified.

116
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,740
Are you going to have
trouble sleeping tonight?

117
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:25,693
I've seen clients far
more defenseless than he.

118
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,079
Well, as the bible says,

119
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,381
"enjoy your fatted calf."

120
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,450
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

121
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,988
He said he's a shipping
magnate, not a client.

122
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,525
Horace senior is connected to
bert cooper in a million ways,

123
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,994
And I don't know if he would
like what just happened in there.

124
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,329
You want to run it by his daddy?

125
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:48,566
He's my age. So he was
born with a lot of money.

126
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,102
He has a dream and it's our
job to make it come true.

127
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,673
Well, there you have it.

128
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,896
Nicely done, my boy.

129
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,584
Elizabeth.

130
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,137
Get off your feet. It's bad for the baby.

131
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,755
As soon as I finish the dishes.

132
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,657
Sit with me.

133
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,992
You're cleaning up for the maid.

134
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,594
You're just like your mother.

135
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,505
I don't like watching you commit suicide.

136
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,190
Neither do your kids.

137
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,377
What do you want, daddy?

138
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:39,951
It's-- it's all
laid out in here--

139
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:44,205
My arrangements. Just follow the directions.

140
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,823
I don't want to talabout this.

141
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,992
We talk about it now and
then we don't talk about it.

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,861
- That's the idea.
- Fine.

143
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:52,280
Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.

144
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,637
Funerals are a dishonest business.

145
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,156
People don't want to think about
it-- that's how they get you.

146
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,641
Remember what happened with your mother?

147
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,897
The will's translucent,
transparent or something

148
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,732
According to the lawyers. You run the show.

149
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,169
You took me in.

150
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,638
Anything else?

151
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,324
I want you to have your mother's coats.

152
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,694
I gave judy the hudson seal,

153
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,129
But I want you to have the chinchilla

154
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,665
And obviously the mink.

155
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,834
They're in the cedar closet.

156
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,136
They key's in gloria's end table.

157
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,005
Okay, daddy.

158
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,177
You don't want to hear about it,

159
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,179
Scarlett o'hara?

160
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,880
I have the folder.

161
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,401
Oh, you've always been sensitive.

162
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,487
That's my fault for shielding you

163
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,156
From all the dangers out there

164
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,375
That's probably why you married this joker.

165
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,297
If you'd even known what was possible...

166
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,669
But that's that. I wrote it down.

167
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,138
We never have to talk about it again.

168
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:10,608
I don't understand why
you like talking about this

169
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,678
When you can see so
clearly that it upsets me.

170
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:17,098
You're being selfish and morbid.

171
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,484
I'm your little girl.

172
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,120
And I know it must be horrible

173
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,822
To be looking at whatever you're looking at,

174
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,974
But can't you keep it to yourself?

175
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,998
What kind of mood is he in?

176
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,267
I'm never right.

177
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,819
- Has anybody been outside? Do I need a coat?
- I'd take it.

178
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,405
Don, george caan dropped out of patio

179
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,207
To direct a picture in l.A.

180
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,843
I look forward to his
average work. Replace him.

181
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:47,929
There's no time and there's no talent.

182
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,814
What were you going to
do if you had to fire him?

183
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:53,517
- Have sal do it.
- Are you serious?

184
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,836
- Sal, do you want to do it?
- Of course I do.

185
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,291
It sounds good, but it makes me very nervous.

186
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,959
It's lifted straight from "bye bye birdie."

187
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,295
It's a single shot. Sal did the storyboards.

188
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,364
I could go on, but I don't
think I should have to.

189
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,065
- Alison?
- Keen's chophouse.

190
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,733
Thank you, don.

191
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,788
Tag. You're it.

192
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,395
Hey. You don't want to cut towards yourself.

193
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,185
There we go.

194
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,738
I've got some great things in here.

195
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,692
This is an exact imitation

196
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,027
Of the gettysburg address.

197
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,813
- You know about honest abe?
- He learned to read by candlelight.

198
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,932
That's right.

199
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,602
Well, I'll be.

200
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,304
Don.

201
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,722
Look at this.

202
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,077
Victory medal, France.

203
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,931
I should have another for beating the clap.

204
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,122
Here we are.

205
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,558
Wow.

206
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,996
That spike--
it's prussian.

207
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,716
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

208
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:52,770
That's where I got him.

209
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,605
You see that?

210
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:58,409
- Dried blood.
- You shot him?

211
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,445
<i>I think so. I shot lots of them.</i>

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,531
They were trying to kill us.

213
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,083
- War is bad.
- Maybe,

214
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,919
<i>But it makes a
man out of you--</i>

215
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:11,021
Living off the land,

216
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,157
Battling the elements,

217
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,193
Standing alongside your brothers.

218
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,396
- Ask your pop.
- Gene.

219
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,199
- What?
- Gene, don't.

220
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,336
- Come on.
- Bobby, give it back.

221
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,022
Let him have it! That's why I got it!

222
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:31,075
- Can't I have it?
- There was a person in that helmet.

223
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,878
- An enemy.
- Bobby, it's a dead man's hat.

224
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,212
- Take it off.
- Keep it on.

225
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,250
<i>It's yours.</i>

226
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:03,974
There was this girl...

227
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:14,451
You like? It was on sale at a&s.

228
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,422
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

229
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:27,998
Oh, kitty.

230
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,837
Kitty.

231
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:36,023
Mmm. I'm working.

232
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:46,217
Something's wrong, isn't it?

233
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:48,369
No.

234
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,171
No no no, don't say that.

235
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,990
Don't say that.

236
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,579
I'm not myself.

237
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,498
What does that mean?

238
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,438
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

239
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,514
Please.

240
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,815
Sal...

241
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,785
The past
few months--

242
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:24,338
Something's wrong.

243
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:26,640
- That's not true.
- It is true.

244
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,128
You know, I don't need that much,

245
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,164
But I do need tending.

246
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,938
I'm so sorry.

247
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,624
Well, what can I do?

248
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,293
You won't even tell me.

249
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,680
Make some excuse.

250
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,817
For the last six months,

251
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,452
Maybe a year even,

252
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,755
I've watched my job disappear.

253
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:01,191
Nobody wants illustrations
anymore. It's all about photography.

254
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,963
And yes, I've been nervous.

255
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,183
And now I have this opportunity

256
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,136
To do something that
really does have a future.

257
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,821
So it's been building to this

258
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,807
And tomorrow you will triumph

259
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,243
And come home a conquering hero.

260
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,730
What's wrong with you?

261
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,933
Well, I do have one horrible flaw.

262
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,985
I love you.

263
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,691
I don't want to fail.

264
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:36,193
- Mmm.
- Just--

265
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:39,563
With a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

266
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,999
So what? You've
seen the movies--

267
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,884
Take two. Take three. Do it again.

268
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:47,270
- Action. - It's one
shot-- the whole thing.

269
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,907
It's the beginning of "bye bye birdie."

270
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,443
Uh, I'm-- I'm
trying to remember.

271
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,678
She starts singing against a blue background

272
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,348
- And her voice is very girlish.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:01,268
- Yes, I remember that.
- She's offering us this can of patio

274
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,904
And she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

275
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,789
- She's walking back and forth?
- No no.

276
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,424
She walks towards you.

277
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,645
The wind is blowing in her hair.

278
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,748
And she sings about how
patio is low in calories.

279
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,667
Then she extends her hand out

280
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,902
And she waves goodbye.

281
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,804
<i>Then we move back too,</i>

282
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,473
But she stops and she
takes her dress in her hands

283
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,243
And she runs forward as fast as she can.

284
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,996
But then she turns her back

285
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,584
And looks seductively over her shoulder.

286
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,853
The treadmill pulls her back again

287
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,739
And she comes towards you one last time,

288
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,991
Dancing right up to the camera.

289
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,177
She sort of pushes her shoulders together,

290
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:44,878
Leans over with the can

291
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:47,815
And she smiles. "hello, patio."

292
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,870
Something like that.

293
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,974
Sound good?

294
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,310
It-- uh, you're
gonna do great.

295
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,023
You really think so?

296
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,742
Yes.

297
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,136
<i>Don, I'd like you to meet Horace Cook.</i>

298
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:30,190
- We've met-- Lincoln
Center. - Of course.

299
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,910
Have a seat. Lane has
brought it to my attention

300
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:36,413
That mr. Cooke's son has
approached us for work.

301
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:38,632
Actually, it was don who thought it best,

302
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,934
Out of deference, to include you.

303
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,320
We're not psychiatrists. There is no...

304
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,322
Confidentiality.

305
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,342
That's not strictly true, but you are family

306
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:51,462
And, well, it appears to be a lot of money.

307
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,614
Bert seemed alarmed.

308
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:56,566
What exactly happened in this meeting?

309
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,586
Well, you know, your son has a dream.

310
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,055
Yes, jai alai.

311
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,858
When he first mentioned it
I assumed he was gambling,

312
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,077
But he seems convinced of
its financial potential.

313
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,363
And there's no reason to doubt that.

314
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,916
Are you drunk? It's like polish handball.

315
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,685
You can't even play it
if you're left-handed.

316
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,019
There's no wall on that side.

317
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,456
Well, then that's done
with. We needn't be involved.

318
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,793
Bert, you know that's not
the way the marketplace works.

319
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,562
A man comes through your door,

320
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,931
He knows what he wants, he's
got the money to back it up,

321
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,700
You do your best.

322
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,252
Perhaps I'm unclear

323
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,139
Because I'm childless, but they're not.

324
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,727
Well, should you be lucky
enough to strike gold,

325
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,548
Remember that your children weren't
there when you were swinging the pick.

326
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:49,019
I've seen his plan. It's gibberish.

327
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,071
But if you refuse him,

328
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,323
He'll only find someone else.

329
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:59,830
My son lives in a cloud of success,

330
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,516
<i>But it's my success.</i>

331
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,153
Perhaps when that evaporates

332
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:09,373
And his face is pressed against
the reality of the sidewalk

333
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:11,842
He'll be of value to someone.

334
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,548
"kill or be killed,

335
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,650
Eat or be eaten."

336
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,252
That's how I was raised.

337
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,856
So you want us to proceed?

338
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,961
When we put that money aside for him,

339
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:33,547
He was a little boy.

340
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,900
We didn't know what kind
of person we were making.

341
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,923
Don't be so hard on yourself.

342
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:46,710
Easy for you to say. He
doesn't have your name.

343
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:49,897
You'll stay for lunch. There's no discussion.

344
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,616
A pleasure to see you again.

345
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,117
A pleasure.

346
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,790
- I'll sign him tonight.
- Very good.

347
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,145
These are ideas.

348
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,980
You can skip some if you want to,

349
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,699
<i>But do not go out of order.</i>

350
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,042
Hello, this is Margaret.

351
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,329
Hello, my name is Elaine and I'm 22.

352
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,548
I have a good job and I'm
interested in a roommate too.

353
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,118
Well, it's nice to speak with you, elaine.

354
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,186
Where do you work?

355
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:32,656
Well, I live in teaneck, new jersey,

356
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,225
So I want to be in this
city to be near my job.

357
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,595
I work in a tannery on the west side.

358
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,231
Really? They make leather?

359
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,367
<i>I'm a secretary,</i>

360
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:47,004
But I am around animal skins
and carcasses most of the day,

361
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:48,805
So I don't keep pets.

362
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,607
<i>The smell makes them go crazy.</i>

363
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,493
Oh.

364
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,813
I don't know if the west
side is what I had in mind.

365
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:59,549
I need someplace near a major hospital.

366
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,886
<i>My face is very badly burnt</i>

367
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,623
And I need frequent prescriptions
for unguents and salves.

368
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,177
Oh.

369
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:13,897
<i>- It would have to be two bedrooms.
- Two bedrooms is good.</i>

370
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:18,952
Now... About the bathroom,

371
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,521
<i>I'm going to need some help there.</i>

372
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,692
Who is this?

373
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,445
You know something? You're a jerk.

374
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,224
Why do you do that?

375
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,859
I've got a salt tooth.

376
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,096
It's right here in the back of my mouth.

377
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,382
Grandpa.

378
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,467
It's getting harder to fool you.

379
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,670
I got two spoons.

380
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:57,007
Mommy doesn't let us have
ice cream before dinner.

381
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,793
Is she afraid you're
gonna be fat like she was?

382
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:05,315
Your grandma ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

383
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,818
and make her walk herself
home. That put a stop to it.

384
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:11,755
- You remember grandma ruth?
- She gave me a ukulele.

385
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:13,390
- Did you learn it?
- No.

386
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,392
You can, you know. You're smart.

387
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:19,579
You remind me of your
grandma more than your mother.

388
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:24,101
You know, she did drafting

389
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:27,304
In the '20s for
this engineer--

390
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,157
A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.

391
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,209
That's good.

392
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,232
You can really do something.

393
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:41,918
Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.

394
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,524
You know, she won't let me eat this either,

395
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,126
And I don't want to be the only one.

396
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:51,645
So I'll tell you what:

397
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,447
I'm gonna keep a lookout.

398
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:59,302
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

399
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,838
Oh, she's coming! Quick, hide it!

400
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,057
I knew you were gonna do that.

401
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,278
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges.

402
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:09,830
You smell that?

403
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,655
A year from now there'll be nothing

404
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,874
But rum and mexican beer in this place.

405
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,460
- You ever have mexican beer, humps?
- I don't drink a lot of beer.

406
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,128
You have to when
you're there--

407
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,214
Amoeba, dysentery.

408
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,182
Patxi caught a bug, lost 8 lbs.

409
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:31,034
That's a lot on his frame.

410
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:33,503
Ho-ho was saying a photo of jack kennedy

411
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,472
Enjoying jai alai would be
a tremendous endorsement.

412
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,558
My father hates kennedy,

413
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,510
Because he knew old joe when
they were criminals together.

414
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,479
Plus dad's against integration.

415
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,515
He called patxi a wetback.

416
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,902
Jack kennedy certainly ended up
with a better job than his father.

417
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,556
I know this idea sounds crazy,

418
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,291
But read your history.

419
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,560
I've got a 50% chance at least.

420
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,729
My father's dead,

421
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:01,731
But I know he'd be interested.

422
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:04,201
This is his kind of investment.

423
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,386
I think about

424
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,671
The way my father made his fortune,

425
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:12,775
Renting ships for troop
transport during the war.

426
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:14,911
He didn't care about the germans.

427
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,813
And then I think

428
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,216
<i>I could really do something.</i>

429
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,184
I might not be president,

430
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,320
But I could-- I
could build something.

431
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,489
People will like it.

432
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:27,424
I'm going to be the father of this sport

433
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,159
<i>And people are going to be
dying to do business with me,</i>

434
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,394
Even my father.

435
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:37,617
I have this image in my mind:

436
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:41,555
It's his 75th birthday

437
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,523
And I give him

438
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,375
A team.

439
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,384
I want to give you a piece of advice.

440
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,221
I've been doing this awhile

441
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,006
And I applaud your enthusiasm,

442
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:04,427
But I think you should take this
decision a little more seriously.

443
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:07,898
- What are you saying, don?
- No, let him-- let him talk.

444
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,116
You have a great fortune,

445
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,869
And that's not just
money-- that's the future.

446
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:19,242
We will take all of your
money, I promise you,

447
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,679
<i>But I think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.</i>

448
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:25,732
You can do better.

449
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,297
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

450
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:43,583
You zig away from me

451
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,368
And I zag back into your arms.

452
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,054
You know, I've got the
galleys of this book by ogilvy.

453
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,673
I learned a lot about advertising.

454
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,526
Then why aren't you
eating dinner with ogilvy?

455
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,662
'cause campbell talked me out of it.

456
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,568
Now let's get one thing straight:

457
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,088
If jai alai fails,

458
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,957
It's your fault.

459
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,811
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

460
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,698
<i>Don't apologize. Everybody
thinks that. Nobody says it.</i>

461
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,946
Are you removing that or moving it?

462
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,832
Did everybody in manhattan decide
I'm not allowed to live here?

463
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,652
No. Actually, I think the right girl

464
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,353
Could have a very good effect on you.

465
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,024
I do, however, find your ad unfortunate.

466
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,960
It's perfect. I proofed it thoroughly.

467
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,697
"clean, responsible, considerate.

468
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,867
I have some nice furniture
and a small television."

469
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,637
It reads like the stage
directions from an ibsen play.

470
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,607
So what then? You'll give me some ideas,

471
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,110
I'll use them and you'll all
have an even bigger laugh?

472
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:02,578
No, I thought I'd tell
you how to get a roommate.

473
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,247
This is not the way.

474
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,001
Fine.

475
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:13,056
Please, joan, tell me how to do it.

476
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,759
For one thing, why "margaret"?

477
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,962
It's my name and it's more adult.

478
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,315
But this is about two
young girls in manhattan.

479
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,184
<i>This is about an adventure.</i>

480
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,602
Am I wrong?

481
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,506
If this were me, I would say something like

482
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,678
"fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.

483
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:37,447
Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

484
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,416
<i>Seeks size 6 for city living</i>

485
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,250
And general gallivanting.

486
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,787
No dull moments or dull men tolerated."

487
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,271
Or something like that.

488
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,558
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.

489
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,062
Don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

490
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:55,098
Branch out.

491
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:57,233
Good night, peggy.

492
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,485
<i>Don. There you are.</i>

493
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,737
I was just on my way over to lane.

494
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,472
I've got signatures.

495
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,242
Horace Cooke jr. is all
dressed and ready for the oven.

496
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,244
In light of all of the trepidation,

497
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,429
Perhaps you should deliver
this to lane yourself.

498
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,657
- Are you following me?
- I spent two years at dartmouth

499
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,660
Hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

500
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,318
Mr. Hooker, has lane
stopped by the clubhouse?

501
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,236
I'll go and get him.

502
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:45,308
That's called a cesta. It's
made of reeds from the pyrenees.

503
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:46,893
The ball is called a pelota.

504
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,244
<i>They just sent all this over.</i>

505
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,134
So did horace have anymore ideas?

506
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,270
For one thing, he wants
us to call it the n.J.A.A.

507
00:30:57,354 --> 00:31:01,074
National jai alai association?

508
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,660
He has no idea how confused
america's gonna be about that j.

509
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,680
Look at this camaraderie.

510
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,566
Perhaps we've discovered
america's pastime after all.

511
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,785
Full steam ahead.

512
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,723
- Bravo, boys.
- How about "Patxi: The motion picture"?

513
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:18,942
God, I wish I was a part of this.

514
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,643
I've informed the home office.

515
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,712
There was a flutter of adding machines.

516
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,214
Well, you heard him, boys.

517
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,850
Don't stop until you see
the whites of his pockets.

518
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,852
Cosgrove.

519
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,687
- Oh!
- Oh! Good god.

520
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,628
Bill it to the kid.

521
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:50,840
- What the hell is that?
- It's an english muffin.

522
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,842
The hell it is. Put it
away. You can eat at school.

523
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:53,376
I already ate reakfast.

524
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:54,060
I already ate

525
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,283
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.

526
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:01,084
I want you dressed and ready
for ballet at 3:00 on the button.

527
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,217
I want you dressed and ready for ballet

528
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:01,584
I want you dressed

529
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,170
- No dawdling.
- Okay.

530
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:04,954
- No dawdling.

531
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,310
I'm going to buy fruit. What do you want?

532
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:13,730
- Peaches, please.
- Peaches give me a rash.

533
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:15,498
Your sister likes 'em.

534
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,470
Are you Peggy?

535
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:22,855
They just sent me back from
reception. I'm Karen Erickson.

536
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,508
Yes, I am. How nice to finally meet you.

537
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:29,078
Oh, you have your own office.

538
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,548
Wowee. At the travel agency it takes years.

539
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,268
Martha Winston's the only girl
and she's married to the boss.

540
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,287
Well, it's different up here.

541
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:40,089
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

542
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,976
You seem like someone I
could really be friends with,

543
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,761
Not like the last girl.

544
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:47,447
Well, I'm fun

545
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:50,833
And I love to have... Fun.

546
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,835
She was always keeping her door shut.

547
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:55,388
I think you should only close
your door for one reason.

548
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:57,523
What's that?

549
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,975
Oh!

550
00:33:00,744 --> 00:33:03,379
I just don't get along
with women like I do men,

551
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:06,649
But she left to get married, so I
must be some kind of good-luck charm.

552
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:10,453
- Do you have a steady?
- No, I'm still playing the field.

553
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,872
<i>There are so many
interesting men out there--</i>

554
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,558
Except sailors. I have a couple of rules.

555
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,026
One of them is I don't like sailors.

556
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,996
No sailors. I agree.

557
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,799
So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask:

558
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,884
Are you swedish? Because I am.

559
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,803
Norwegian.

560
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,990
Well, we won't tell my parents.

561
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,910
I'll make appointments and come by at 5:00.

562
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,511
Or do you want your girl to do it?

563
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,797
I finish up around 6:00.

564
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,949
- Well, then tomorrow?
- Most days.

565
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,652
Can we look on Saturday?

566
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,704
- Oh, but not this Saturday.
- Do you work on Saturday?

567
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:47,123
Not every Saturday. And
Saturday nights never.

568
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,759
I'm out in the city, ready for fun.

569
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,895
<i>Well, okay. I'll call you, roomie.</i>

570
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,065
oh, I got you a sandwich.

571
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,002
Oh. I'm gonna walk around the park.

572
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,554
Well, have fun, roomie.

573
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,224
It's mommy.

574
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,550
- Where's grandpa gene?
- It must've slipped his mind.

575
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,970
- Where is he?
- Probably at home.

576
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,822
I'm sure he'll be there when we get home.

577
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,128
I can't even tell you how thorough sal was.

578
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:07,063
Well, I appreciate that,

579
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,964
But
this is--

580
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,334
I don't know. This is not
what I thought it was gonna be.

581
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:13,986
I'm glad I'm not alone.

582
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,671
Look, I don't think there's any ambiguity

583
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,740
About this
being exactly--

584
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,460
And I mean exactly--
what you asked for.

585
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:23,379
I know, but there's
something not right about it.

586
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,947
What?

587
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:28,651
I, uh, can't put my finger on it.

588
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,570
<i>I wish I could but I can't.</i>

589
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,623
It's an exact copy--
frame for frame.

590
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:37,126
I'll tell you what: Why don't we send
a dupe back to the office with you?

591
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,595
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

592
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:41,898
I wish I could explain it,

593
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,933
But it's just not right.

594
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,902
I'm gonna be magnanimous

595
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,454
And say it's our idea and our failure,

596
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:51,090
But it is a failure.

597
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:53,976
That is magnanimous.

598
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:58,981
- I'm sorry about that.
- Maybe next time.

599
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,891
It's true. It's not right.

600
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:10,693
It doesn't make any sense. It looks right.

601
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,829
It sounds right, smells right.

602
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,914
Something's not right. What is it?

603
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:16,232
It's not ann margret.

604
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:36,269
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

605
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:44,093
Yes, may I help you?

606
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,495
Are you related to eugene hofstadt?

607
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,464
Yes, I am. What is it?

608
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:51,651
We regret to inform you that he passed away.

609
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:54,186
- Oh god.
- No!

610
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,688
I'm fine.

611
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:01,510
- What happened?
- He collapsed in line at the a&p.

612
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,379
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

613
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,900
I,
uh--

614
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,153
I--

615
00:38:11,238 --> 00:38:14,290
Well, we need to know what
you'd like to do with his body.

616
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,228
Yes, of course.

617
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,201
<i>Mr. Romano's here to see you.</i>

618
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:43,836
Send him in.

619
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:50,426
I figured I'd bring myself to the woodshed.

620
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,562
It must be horrible having
a client insist on something

621
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,531
And then change their
mind once they've seen it.

622
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:57,583
I hope it never happens to me.

623
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,868
I was the director and I let you down.

624
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,274
- I'm in a meeting.
- I have mrs. Draper on the line.

625
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,877
- It's urgent.
- I can go.

626
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:13,415
What's the matter?

627
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,858
I'm sorry, betts.

628
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,413
I'm-- I'm
very sorry.

629
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:31,801
Do you want me to call william?

630
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:37,356
Just stay put. I'll be right there.

631
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,495
- I have to go.
- Is everything okay?

632
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:45,414
There's nothing you can do.

633
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,486
Don't ruin the only good
thing to come of this.

634
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,405
You are now a commercial director.

635
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:58,244
How do I know you're not just
saying that to make me feel better?

636
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:01,914
You'll know when I hire you again.

637
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,766
Alison, I'm going for the day.

638
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,222
Oh. Oh oh oh oh.

639
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,909
Okay, ma.

640
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,945
Oh my goodness.

641
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,914
Oh, it's beautiful.

642
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,801
Oh, is that all the noise that this was?

643
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,752
Why didn't you wait for gerry to help?

644
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:26,172
Because he's playing cards
and peggy gets up early.

645
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,808
- Say thank you, ma.
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

646
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,829
An admiral. Oh, you must be doing well.

647
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,664
I am.

648
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:37,800
What's the matter, peaches?

649
00:40:39,302 --> 00:40:40,770
Sit down, ma.

650
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,106
What's this about?

651
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:48,610
Don't, anita. Stay.

652
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:55,267
Ma, I'm having problems with my apartment,

653
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,287
My commute is
very long and--

654
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:02,358
Oh, it doesn't mean nothing if
you want to stay here with us.

655
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,710
Your father and I lived with
grandma and grandpa for years.

656
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,062
Your sister was born there.

657
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:11,217
Ma, I'm getting an apartment in manhattan.

658
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,270
Oh.

659
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:18,774
Well, that makes sense.

660
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:21,443
It really does.

661
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:22,978
Yeah, I guess I'm the kind of mother

662
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,997
Who would rather have a
new tv than a daughter.

663
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:27,633
I got you a new tv because you needed one.

664
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,386
You got me a new tv 'cause
you think I was born yesterday.

665
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,605
You belong in the city.

666
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:34,607
Do you see this, anita?

667
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:36,642
This is what they do. Family is cheap.

668
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:39,228
Well, take it back, okay?

669
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:42,248
Because it's just gonna remind
me of how stupid you think I am.

670
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:45,584
Ma! You knew she'd have
to move there eventually.

671
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,892
Someday both of youse is gonna feel this,

672
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:55,978
This-- this broken
heart I'm carrying.

673
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,817
You'll get raped, you know that?

674
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:06,255
It's just as dangerous as here,

675
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:08,290
And I'm going to have a roommate.

676
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:10,793
She's a nice girl. Her
name is Karen Erickson.

677
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:12,461
She's Norwegian.

678
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:13,846
There's a man, isn't there?

679
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,431
No.

680
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,200
Why would I ever believe anything you say?

681
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,936
Stop it, ma. You're being cruel.

682
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,240
Good night, ma.

683
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:37,219
That wasn't so bad.

684
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,804
Really?

685
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:41,407
She's been through a lot of change lately.

686
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:44,693
The holy father dying--
that was very hard on her.

687
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:51,200
<i>It has become one country because all
of us and all the people who came here</i>

688
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:53,836
<i>had an equal chance to develop their talents.</i>

689
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,207
<i>You cannot say to 10% of the population
that you cannot have that right.</i>

690
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:03,279
<i>Eugene Hofstadt #2.</i>

691
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:09,001
Eugene Hofstadt #2.

692
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,422
What does that mean?

693
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:16,342
There were two Eugene Hofstadts at his bank,

694
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:19,461
So he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt #2.

695
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:24,433
Well, he's with ruth now.

696
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,803
I hope so.

697
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,124
Once he asked,

698
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,376
"what's gonna happen when I get to heaven

699
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,844
And I have two wives?"

700
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:39,665
Knowing Gloria, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

701
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:51,310
Betts, don't eat that.
It was in his car all day.

702
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:53,762
I don't care.

703
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,734
- Why are you laughing?
- Sally sweetheart--

704
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:01,320
- We weren't laughing, honey.
- I heard you.

705
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:03,322
I heard you laughing.

706
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:06,208
<i>How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?</i>

707
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,360
<i>Like he's not gone?</i>

708
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:10,195
<i>He was here, now he's not here.</i>

709
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,748
He's gone forever and nobody even knows that.

710
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:15,951
Stop it. You're being hysterical.

711
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:18,370
- Calm down.
- He's dead!

712
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,789
He's dead and he's never coming back!

713
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:23,092
<i>And nobody cares</i>

714
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,594
<i>That he's really really really gone!</i>

715
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,462
Sally, go watch tv.

716
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,812
<i>...Soviet border</i>

717
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:46,315
<i>When the convoy commander rejected commands</i>

718
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:48,651
<i>That his troops leave their
vehicles for a head count.</i>

719
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:52,571
<i>The russians finally allowed
the convoy to pass. Robert.</i>

720
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:55,324
Dumbstruck police and
horrified crowds gathered

721
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,226
As an elderly buddhist monk

722
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,994
<i>Set fire to himself today,</i>

723
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,131
<i>Resulting in his death. The bizarre act was</i>

724
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:03,999
<i>A protest against the
mostly-catholic government</i>

725
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,668
<i>Of ngo dinh diem of south vietnam</i>

726
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,672
<i>And their supposed
campaign of discrimination.</i>

727
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:12,591
<i>The new york stock exchange today saw</i>

728
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,643
<i>Slight gains and moderate trading</i>

729
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,180
<i>As the dow jones industrial
average rose nearly two points.</i>

730
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:22,067
<i>And now here's stan baker
for winston cigarettes.</i>

9999
