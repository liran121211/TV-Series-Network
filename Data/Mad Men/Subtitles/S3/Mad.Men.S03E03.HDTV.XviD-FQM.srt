1
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:06,445
Muter for bierdopje.eu

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,319
And after that I played
the nurse in "Romeo and Juliet."

3
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:17,743
And after that I played Dorine
the maid in "Tartuffe" by Moliere.

4
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,214
And I guess that's it.

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,885
- Thank you, Hillary.
- I'd love it if you could do the twist one more time.

6
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,109
Thank you, Hillary.

7
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,895
We'll let you know.

8
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,301
Harry, you are not in this process.

9
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,936
You're a spectator.
Don't forget it.

10
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:48,641
Bacardi's coming in on Tuesday to
see if Daiquiri Beach has legs.

11
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,543
Don wants copy Monday
morning and art Monday night.

12
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,245
We should probably
have the whole team.

13
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,481
This weekend? No.

14
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,499
I'm sorry, but we just heard about it.

15
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,152
- Bullshit.
- I have plans.

16
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,754
I really do.

17
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,722
Well, I would love to work all weekend,

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,491
but I'm just a spectator.

19
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,426
Whose crack did it fall through?

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,979
Because you are going to spend
the weekend being our slave.

21
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,998
- No finger-pointing.
- The bad news is

22
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,502
they need five more vacation
situations for bacardi rum.

23
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,637
The good news is we're going
to be out of your hair... 

24
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:20,990
Jane and Roger Sterling's
garden party on the island.

25
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,341
Derby day.

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,326
You're going back in time?

27
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,711
Are any of you wearing seersucker?

28
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,246
I don't want to look like
a barbershop quartet.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,632
- You're all going?
- I really wish I wasn't.

30
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,917
Well, then don't. Give me
your glasses. I'll go as you.

31
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,469
Sorry about that.

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,289
- Good luck, Gentiles.
- Sorry.

33
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,260
You know, we all started at the same time.

34
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,330
I've been here six years longer than you.

35
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,081
They hate creative.

36
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,746
My goodness. I didn't
expect to see you here.

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,699
- For a little while longer.
- Lovely to see you, Jane... 

38
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,200
I mean, Mrs. Sterling.

39
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,207
I'll catch up with you, girls.

40
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,162
I just stopped by. Roger
had my rings resized.

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,632
I keep losing weight.
Where are you living now?

42
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,301
Same old place,
but we're looking.

43
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,403
We're thinking about Riverdale.

44
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,989
It's near Columbia Pres
and Greg wants a yard.

45
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,808
I don't know. I get a nosebleed
anywhere above 86th Street.

46
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,931
- God, it's so great to see you.
- Likewise.

47
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:39,435
Oh! Joan, I have a
tiny favor to ask you.

48
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,537
They're doing construction
in front of the building

49
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,505
and my driver's gonna be circling,

50
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,923
so if you could have
one of the girls run down

51
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,559
at 1:15 and flag him down.

52
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,363
Hello, Ginger.

53
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,176
Olive, from now on there's no need
to include Mr. Crane in casting.

54
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,645
Of course. And I brought
you tea and coffee.

55
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,747
I'll just have whichever
one you don't want.

56
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,450
I have coffee.
That's what I usually drink.

57
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,385
That's what I've been drinking, right?

58
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,254
Well, Lola said you don't
like a second cup of coffee

59
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,538
because it makes you edgy.

60
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,425
I want you to forget
everything Lola told you.

61
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,535
I left for an hour to go
get the nylons for tomorrow,

62
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,304
and look what happened.

63
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,907
Carla said he thought
he was on K.P. Duty.

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,509
We don't have to go, you know.

65
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,561
I said we would.

66
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,581
It's Roger and Jane.

67
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,633
I want to go.

68
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,218
I bought a dress.

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,461
"The warmth of the climate
disposed the natives...

70
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,831
...to the most intemperate enjoyment
of tranquility and opulence,

71
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,902
and the lively licen... licent... "

72
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,704
licentiousness.

73
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,174
Go ahead.

74
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,078
"...Of the greeks was blended

75
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,715
with the hereditary
softness of the syrians.

76
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,985
Fashion was the only law,

77
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,337
pleasure was the only pursuit

78
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,274
and the splendor of dress and furniture

79
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,527
was the only distinction of
the citizens of antioch."

80
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,980
- Gene.
- Well, hello, Don.

81
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,902
- How's Babylon?
- Bedtime.

82
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,105
It's all right. Go wash your teeth.

83
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:46,195
You just wait. All hell's gonna break loose.

84
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,149
Good night, Grandpa Gene.

85
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,831
Like that.

86
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,000
Paul Kinsey with the two-stroke lead.

87
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,503
- What is your secret?
- I use Harry Crane's paddle,

88
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,272
and I pretend that's his fat head.

89
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,909
What kind of fruit do you put in this?

90
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,394
It's rum and coke. I don't know.

91
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,480
A cherry? All we have is olives.

92
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,249
New drinks, new copy or both?

93
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,318
Bikinis that match the
drinks and new copy.

94
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,853
Something cute.

95
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,458
It's bacardi-licious.

96
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,394
It's bacardi-lightful.

97
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:40,198
We're supposed to sit here and
pretend like we're on vacation?

98
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,651
They're probably drinking mint juleps.

99
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,120
Ugh.
Booze puts me to sleep.

100
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,757
I will take grass any hour
of the day. It helps me think.

101
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,143
When I was at princeton,
I wrote my senior thesis

102
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,629
on the passions of the stoics.

103
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,647
Mary Jane was my muse.

104
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,584
Paul helps me sleep.

105
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,986
Peggy, go get a blender.

106
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:03,121
Maybe we can turn this into a frappe.

107
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,123
- You get it.
- I'm eating.

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,474
Olive?

109
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,410
What are you doing here?

110
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,629
Well, if you're working, I'm working.

111
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,215
It's okay for you to go home.

112
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,184
Oh, I already canceled my plans.

113
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,202
Phil and I were going to
drive up to the cloisters.

114
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,806
And Steven, my son... 
he's at Boston College... 

115
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,925
was thinking of coming
down with his girlfriend,

116
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,228
but I'm not sure that's
working out. He's picky.

117
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,732
Anyway, so Phil's
taking a trip to the dump

118
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,369
and here I am, no worse for wear.

119
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,194
Don't I seem as important as cosgrove?

120
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,497
I mean, Campbell makes sense... 
to the manner born.

121
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,635
- So you like to get high?
- Whenever I can.

122
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,954
My cousin used to know
someone, but he got married.

123
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,622
Who's your friend?

124
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,944
A guy like you? There must
be somebody you can call.

125
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,963
Yeah.

126
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,931
No. Of course.

127
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,270
Sally, get up here.

128
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,078
I just walked backwards all
the way from the living room.

129
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,047
Zip.

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,067
You look pretty.

131
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,154
I look like an open umbrella.

132
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,506
Grandpa says that
you're going to a soiree.

133
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,590
Don't bother him.

134
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,560
Go watch TV.

135
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,270
- Grandpa?
- I'm indisposed.

136
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,985
What are you doing?
You're going to break it.

137
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,604
- Who told you that?
- I've done it.

138
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,341
If it happens, I'll go get my little
screwdriver and put on a new one.

139
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,546
Jesus, I stink.

140
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,048
I can finish up out here.

141
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,833
You take a nice, long bath.

142
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,023
No. No no no. Eddinger
goes at the head of the table.

143
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,125
He's the chief of surgery.
It's where he always sits.

144
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,311
Not in your home, Greg.

145
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,230
Host at the head, hostess at the foot

146
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,815
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen

147
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,917
and then it's boy, girl, boy, girl.

148
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,835
- Who says?
- Emily post. Everyone.

149
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,971
Ronald Eddinger does
not read Emily Post.

150
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,939
He's going to expect to sit there

151
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,459
and he's going to expect me and
Rick Stoller to be his footstools.

152
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,060
Well, I won't have their wives think

153
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,345
you have a wife who doesn't
know how to set a table.

154
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,397
Joanie, I don't want to
have a fight right now.

155
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,932
Then stop talking.

156
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,723
A buffet would be slightly more casual

157
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,292
and people could sit where they will.

158
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,027
And we could put the chafing dish

159
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,595
that they gave us right in the middle.

160
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,665
Perfect.

161
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,336
Hey.

162
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:55,454
In state news, Governor Rockefeller is
being urged to appoint a special prosecutor

163
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,173
to investigate the scandal-ridden
state liquor authority.

164
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,058
Carla.

165
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,260
Carla?

166
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,728
Is she here?

167
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,432
Look at you.

168
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,100
I know I look good for my condition,

169
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,536
But I'm still in my condition.

170
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,339
- Did they leave yet?
- No, I think they're in the living room.

171
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,757
Well, I've been robbed.

172
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,959
I had it right here and now I don't.

173
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,411
Daddy, what are you talking about?

174
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:24,032
I had $35.
Now I have $30.

175
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,484
- Are you sure?
- Mr. Hofstadt,

176
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,271
why don't you go sit down
and we'll all look for it?

177
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,822
Oh. You'll look for it,
will you?

178
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,091
Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.

179
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,911
I'm missing $5.

180
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,463
I'll give you $5.

181
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,566
Don, will you give him something?

182
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,420
Here, Gene. Here you go.

183
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,005
No, I don't want your money.

184
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:51,126
You people, you think money is
the answer to every problem.

185
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,778
No, just this particular problem.

186
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,897
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I don't know what you want.

187
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,616
I want my $5!

188
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,722
Well, I think I am finally ready to go.

189
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,947
Come on, let's go out in the yard.

190
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,104
I forgot how many tourists are in midtown.

191
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,541
They're like vermin.

192
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,543
Jeffrey, this is my colleague smitty.

193
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,812
- How you doing, Jeff?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

194
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,714
So what do you have for us?

195
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,050
What do you want?

196
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,719
I've got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.

197
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,088
Probably get you junk if you really wanted it.

198
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,158
- How do you know each other?
- Jeffrey's an old friend.

199
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,294
You're looking at the two great
cocksmen of Princeton '55.

200
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,697
Oh, the times you must have had.

201
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,198
Can we buy some dope?

202
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,322
I'll give you all four
for $10, plus delivery.

203
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,175
I'm just kidding, but I should.

204
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,243
I mean, you never call me.

205
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,845
When's the last time I saw you?

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,518
- Give me your sweater.
- It's mohair.

207
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:22,333
May I?
- Relax. Sit down.

208
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,772
You ever look out this window?

209
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,863
It's beautiful.

210
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,672
Nice to see you both.
Isn't it something?

211
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,241
Betty, you remember Trudy.

212
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,476
Harry Crane. My wife Jennifer.

213
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,812
Ken Cosgrove. We've... we've met.

214
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:11,032
- Nice to see you all again.
- When are you due?

215
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,151
Any minute. Can't you tell?

216
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,288
Oh, that last month was the worse.

217
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,258
- But of course this is your second.
- Uh, third.

218
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:24,095
- How old is yours?
- Eight months. Beatrice Grace.

219
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,433
Should we take a tour?

220
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,737
- I grew up in a club just like this.
- Me too.

221
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,946
That portly fellow in the Glen plaid... 

222
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,865
second at Dupont.

223
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,534
The one next to him: Pan Am.

224
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,123
Don't hand out your card.

225
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,186
Now you're getting ridiculous.

226
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,671
Maybe it fell out of your pocket.

227
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:10,641
- It didn't.
- Well, I didn't take it.

228
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:14,011
- I didn't say you did.
- Not yet.

229
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:16,447
Will you stop it, Viola?

230
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,784
My name's not Viola. It's Carla.

231
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,235
Do you know Viola?

232
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,489
We don't all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.

233
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,328
Are you done looking already?

234
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,664
Really?

235
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,314
Are they still here?

236
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,516
Yes, they're in Mr. Kinsey's office.

237
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,602
I know what they're doing.
You don't want to go in there.

238
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,939
- What are they doing?
- All I'm saying is

239
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:17,859
they obviously don't want to
work, so you should just go home.

240
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:29,737
I love the commercials where the dog
runs right up to the bowl of food.

241
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,506
How do you make him do that?

242
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,827
- You starve him?
- So you two got a lot of girls?

243
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,979
Shit.

244
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,199
Is that that old lady again?

245
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,218
- Let me in.
- Go away.

246
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,437
It stinks out here.

247
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,790
Come in quick.

248
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,044
What are you doing?

249
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,430
I know what you're doing.

250
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,531
Who are you?

251
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,002
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, '55.

252
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,588
Look, I need it for inspiration.

253
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,074
It's Saturday, for God's sake.

254
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,627
You can go home. We'll do the work.

255
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:11,679
Are you kidding? We'll end up with nothing.

256
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,485
I've got some ideas we can kick around,

257
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,754
but you're gonna have to
tell me your name, sweetheart.

258
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,626
I'm Peggy Olson, and I want
to smoke some marijuana.

259
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,628
You won't like it.

260
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:30,097
How do you know what I'll like?

261
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:34,201
You never ask me how I feel about anything
except brassieres, body odor and makeup.

262
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,325
I'd like to know how you
feel about a lot of things.

263
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,978
- Jesus. Give it a rest.
- Come on.

264
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,707
It's just like a strong cigarette.

265
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,396
Can you believe this?

266
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:51,979
Can we go?

267
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,448
What about the horse race?

268
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,834
What about supper?

269
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:00,171
Don't disappear. I want to dance.

270
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:08,879
I did this at home... threw
on a little shoe polish.

271
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,131
- She thought it was a scream.
- I love it.

272
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,850
Mmm.

273
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,335
Can I get an old-fashioned?

274
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,156
We're on the same mission.

275
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,175
This bar looks like it
was set up by a blind man,

276
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,677
and there's no bourbon.

277
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,419
There's a hole at the end here.

278
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,538
I don't have a lot of time.

279
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,780
- Rye okay with you?
- You look like you know what you're doing.

280
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,049
I'm Connie, by the way.

281
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,717
Don.

282
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,289
Service always this good around here?

283
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,276
- You're not a member either?
- No no.

284
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:16,464
Nice piece of property, though.

285
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,999
Who are you hiding from?

286
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,687
I am at work disguised as a party.

287
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm at work disguised as a wedding.

288
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,611
I hate other people's weddings.

289
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,049
- Why's that?
- Make me nervous,

290
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:38,302
all those expectations.

291
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:40,421
And these poor kids in here... 

292
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,991
Whew!... That is a match
made in the boardroom.

293
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,180
When I was a boy,

294
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,765
there was a mansion on the river

295
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,567
I used to paddle by in my johnboat.

296
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,738
The twinkling lights,

297
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,008
violins, girls giggling about something.

298
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,444
Huh.

299
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,935
It's different inside.

300
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:20,060
- Where you from?
- San Antonio, New Mexico,

301
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,363
before it was a state.

302
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,166
Don't ask me that... old.

303
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,700
You look fit.

304
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:30,654
You ever see

305
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,157
"A Midsummer Dream"
with Mickey Rooney?

306
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,209
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"?

307
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,711
By golly, you're prickly.

308
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:42,383
I'm Republican,
like everyone else in there,

309
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,484
But somehow,

310
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,137
no matter how expensive my cufflinks,

311
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,957
I feel like I've got the head of a jackass.

312
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,597
Where I grew up, there was a roadhouse.

313
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,566
It boasted live music... 

314
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,567
That meant a drum, a bass

315
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,204
And a player piano with nobody at it.

316
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:05,505
I parked cars.

317
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,526
Fancy people would go there.

318
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,911
They'd get loud, they'd get drunk,

319
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,347
But they wouldn't let me use the toilet.

320
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:17,368
- Oh.
- So when nature called

321
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:20,538
I'd open up a trunk
and relieve myself.

322
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,557
You didn't.

323
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,059
I was 15.

324
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,445
There's probably some kid out
there doing it to us right now.

325
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,582
Where you come from?

326
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,186
Pennsylvania by way of Illinois.

327
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,774
We lost our farm,
ended up in coal country.

328
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:43,277
And here you are.

329
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,032
A pleasure to meet you, Don.

330
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,683
Hell of a cocktail.

331
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,758
Rum. Have some.

332
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,794
Some rum?

333
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:20,464
If you were feeling it, you'd be hungry.

334
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,067
I am hungry, but it's not worth moving.

335
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,035
She is a riot.

336
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,204
Makes me wish I had a job.

337
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,657
Bacardi Eisenhower.

338
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:36,647
What are you laughing about?

339
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,683
You do have a job, Jeffrey.

340
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:42,152
You're a drug pusher.

341
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,658
What is that, an English accent?

342
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,360
It's a little different
than freshman year.

343
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,881
Kinsey was a real jersey.

344
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,401
I guess that's why
they have scholarships.

345
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,407
Get out.

346
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,180
You're arrogant.

347
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,848
And you know what else?

348
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,867
You can't sing.

349
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,420
Take it back.

350
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,956
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here not to fight.

351
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,225
Take it back, Graves.

352
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,029
Fine. I guess they kicked
you out of the tigertones

353
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,698
because you were too tall.

354
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,249
Graves...

355
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,353
We're done here.

356
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,054
And by the way,

357
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,906
I left the tones because I had mono.

358
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,359
Fine.

359
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,993
Why don't you sing a little

360
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,479
and let them be the judge?

361
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,867
I am so high.

362
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,610
I wish you were waiting for me.

363
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,218
So who are you waiting for?

364
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,904
A friend.

365
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,827
What is that like?

366
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,632
I don't know.

367
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,167
I don't think about it.

368
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,972
Right now it's uncomfortable, mostly.

369
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,891
But it moves around in there.

370
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,210
It does.

371
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,283
I'm going to blame this on martinis,

372
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,419
but... may I?

373
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,892
She's not moving now.

374
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,830
Who are you waiting for?

375
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,499
My date.

376
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,952
You can't show up to these things stag,

377
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,322
but then you run into people.

378
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,481
I apologize.

379
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,566
There was a line for the mirror
and I feel like I'm melting.

380
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,702
No trouble at all.

381
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,556
I hope they start playing some real music.

382
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,974
I'm here to dance, aren't you?

383
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,862
- Ooh.
- Ooh, martinis.

384
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,864
Please, don't stand on ceremony, dig in.

385
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,356
I'll cut the cheese.

386
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,493
What are you laughing about?

387
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,546
Everything is some private joke with them.

388
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,264
What were you giggling
about the other day?

389
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,417
- A code pink.
- What's that?

390
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,636
They put a call over the P.A.

391
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,472
Whenever there's an
attractive unconscious female.

392
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:58,058
I've never heard
of that.

393
00:27:58,142 --> 00:28:00,627
- Me either.
- Sounds like where I work.

394
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,582
- Ooh, I'm gonna check the roast.
- You need a hand?

395
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,185
- I don't think so.
- Nonsense.

396
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,353
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

397
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,623
Thanks.

398
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,193
You really have a lovely place.

399
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,396
I'm glad you like it.

400
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,281
I did most of it myself.

401
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:23,934
You must do well.

402
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,753
It's not easy.
Not that I'm complaining.

403
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:29,506
You think they make no money now?

404
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,641
You should've seen back when
Ronald and I were first married.

405
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,579
I taught kindergarten and
made three times what Ron did.

406
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,080
We lived in a pit.

407
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,916
But one day you'll look
back on this time and smile.

408
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,818
Just don't get pregnant.

409
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,853
Excuse me?

410
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,340
The last thing you want
right now is a child.

411
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,010
I told her the same thing, but
she doesn't listen. She's a nurse.

412
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,596
You do what you want.

413
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,032
If Greg becomes chief resident,
things will get easier.

414
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,103
The fact that Greg can
get a woman like you,

415
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:03,240
makes me feel good about his
future, no matter what happens.

416
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:14,050
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!

417
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,257
You have to eat something.

418
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:24,027
You don't tell me what to do.

419
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,263
You either eat or you don't eat,

420
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,864
but there'll be no more of that.

421
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:34,237
I told you I'm not hungry.

422
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:37,841
- I want my money.
- You don't even know that you lost it.

423
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,444
Maybe you should lie down.
Sally!

424
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,240
Grandpa, is this it?

425
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,376
Grandpa, is this your money?

426
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,847
I don't know. Let me see it.

427
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:54,251
Yeah, that's it, all right.

428
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,794
Well, that's a relief. Sally,
your food's getting cold.

429
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,929
Excuse me.

430
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,052
Why, thank you.

431
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:33,490
He's pretending like we didn't
have a fight on the way over.

432
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,593
He seems amenable right now.

433
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:38,528
I warned him that with this set

434
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,780
There was a good chance one
of my old beaus might appear.

435
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,066
- And yet they didn't.
- Which is a relief.

436
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,021
I don't want to.

437
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,972
All I have to talk about
is work, which is verboten.

438
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,275
That's nonsense.
You're very charming.

439
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,160
Come on. I'll talk.

440
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,663
They want to know we're
having a good time.

441
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:09,209
We're really having a good time.

442
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:13,930
Haven't seen you two on the dance floor.

443
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,915
Oh, I don't move that well right now.

444
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:19,802
Don loves to dance,

445
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,338
But I think I'm disappointing
him because I don't feel like it.

446
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,026
Your asses are going to
wear out those chairs.

447
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,962
Roger.

448
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:33,182
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...

449
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,384
Sherry Ardmore.

450
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,436
Henry works in the governor's office.

451
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,938
Don Draper. This is my wife Betty.

452
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,492
Hank, tell them where
you were this afternoon.

453
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,311
- Roger.
- Oh, they're gonna read about it in the paper.

454
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,698
He just came from pocantico.
Rockefeller married happy.

455
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:52,268
She just got divorced a month
ago. She has four children.

456
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,737
You see?
That's the first reaction.

457
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,024
Divorce is political hari-kari.

458
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,076
Now we'll be stuck with goldwater.

459
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:02,312
The primaries are still a long way off.

460
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,949
- Why did Rocky marry her?
- They're in love.

461
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,257
We're going to dance.

462
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,025
Betty, Don, are you sure
you're not up for it?

463
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,541
I have got to bring a date next time.

464
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,259
"This is the way the world ends

465
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,595
This is the way the world ends

466
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,547
This is the way the world ends

467
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,434
Not with a bang but a whimper."

468
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:07,103
We got it... you're educated

469
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,872
and you sang in the tiger... 

470
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:12,425
- What are they called?
- Tigertones.

471
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:17,747
I went to the university of Michigan.

472
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,485
I went to Miss Deaver's
secretarial school.

473
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,821
Can you believe her?

474
00:35:24,855 --> 00:35:28,091
I keep thinking about rum,
I keep thinking about Cuba

475
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:30,893
and I keep thinking about
how we're all going to die.

476
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,129
We almost died.

477
00:35:33,163 --> 00:35:35,248
But we didn't.

478
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:37,633
How about something about life?

479
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:40,803
Let's go on the roof.

480
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,106
And do what?

481
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,425
Think about Daiquiri Beach.

482
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,176
We need five more situations for rum.

483
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,081
On the roof is a
good idea, actually... 

484
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:55,384
A hammock right between the clotheslines.

485
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:57,987
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.

486
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,790
Are you working?

487
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,026
I think so.

488
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,969
You both can leave.

489
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:18,107
I'm in a very good place right now.

490
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,884
Uh.

491
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,997
You left your purse in
your office... unattended.

492
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:43,166
Someone could have stolen it.

493
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,734
No one's here.

494
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,505
You think I don't know what
you've been doing in there?

495
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:52,975
I don't know what to say.

496
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:54,994
I've got nothing to hide.

497
00:36:55,078 --> 00:37:00,183
You're free to do whatever you want, but
you're not thinking about your future.

498
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:06,005
The thing is I have a job.

499
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:10,860
I have my own office
with my name on the door,

500
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,912
and I have a secretary.

501
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:14,797
That's you.

502
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,503
And I am not scared of any of this.

503
00:37:26,226 --> 00:37:28,027
But you're scared.

504
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,247
Oh my God.

505
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,416
You're scared.

506
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,956
Don't worry about me.

507
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,092
I am going to get to do everything

508
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,894
you want for me.

509
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,948
I'm going to be fine, Olive.

510
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,169
I really am.

511
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:00,860
Your expense report
is ready for your review.

512
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:02,461
It's on your desk.

513
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,025
I need you to get the dictaphone set up

514
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,960
and I need a glass of
water, and then you can go.

515
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,799
Oh, that's very pretty.

516
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,570
Thank you.

517
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,064
- When are you due?
- Early September.

518
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,749
You and the first lady.

519
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,385
Well, I think she looks a lot better.

520
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:43,887
You could dress like that.

521
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:45,838
Go to Lord & Taylor and ask
for my friend Bunny Appelle.

522
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,974
- She'll take care of you.
- You really know everything Joan.

523
00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,930
Honey, would you talk to your husband?

524
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:56,466
I don't know what I'm
going to do next year.

525
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,019
He is going to be a tough act to follow.

526
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,122
Those people in Texas will
be crawling all over you.

527
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,858
If I ever need a pneumonectomy,
that's the man.

528
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,011
Well, you heard me say it... 

529
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,262
Great hands.

530
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,835
Look, Greg, it's a
complicated operation.

531
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:17,904
Oh, Christ, that's not what I meant.

532
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,006
- It happens.
- What happened?

533
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,711
I don't like to worry Joanie
about those kinds of things.

534
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:27,497
Oh, come on. Everyone gets a bad
result every once in a while.

535
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,985
You know what?
Enough shop talk.

536
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,821
This is not civilian conversation.

537
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,575
Do you want to play charades?

538
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,261
- Come on. You're terrible.
- No, I'm not.

539
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:46,098
Well, Joanie has many many talents.

540
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,784
You should play for them.

541
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,536
- No.
- Come on. I'll go get it.

542
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,309
- You're all gonna love this.
- What do you play?

543
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,111
I am out of practice.

544
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,080
- Come on, Joanie.
- Wonderful!

545
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:04,417
Come on, just sing a
little something.

546
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,890
It'll be just like the olden days.

547
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,759
We used to sit in
the parlor after supper.

548
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,560
My mother would play
the piano while we read.

549
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,396
Just let me have another
bite and then we can go.

550
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,372
I guess we're the last ones to eat.

551
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,374
That's what my mother always said.

552
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:38,344
Family holds back. Oh!

553
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:43,649
You shouldn't be filling your plate.
You're the hostess.

554
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,785
- I'll get you some food.
- Come on. Come on.

555
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:49,338
- You should sit down.
- Oh, okay.

556
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,758
Oh my God! You're pregnant.

557
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:55,361
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

558
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:57,230
Don't you just love looking at her?

559
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,999
Aren't they a beautiful couple?

560
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:02,919
I knew you two would get back together.

561
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,940
I never had any doubt, no
matter what the problem was.

562
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,010
I'll take care of her.

563
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:20,152
You don't like me.

564
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:23,155
I'm a nice person.

565
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:25,892
What's going on here?

566
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:32,665
I should've eaten something.

567
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:40,172
Will someone please
get her a glass of milk?

568
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,058
Don, can I talk to you for a second?

569
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,815
What the hell was that?

570
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,384
Your wife's drunk.

571
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:57,657
I don't know what I did
to get under your skin.

572
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:00,793
Roger, it's late.

573
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:05,181
You know, my mother was right:

574
00:43:05,265 --> 00:43:08,284
It's a mistake to be
conspicuously happy.

575
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,336
Some people don't like it.

576
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,589
No one thinks you're happy.

577
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,975
They think you're foolish.

578
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:22,415
You know, that's the great
thing about a place like this... 

579
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,252
You can come here and be happy,

580
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:28,521
and you get to choose your guests.

581
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,844
Good night, Grandpa.

582
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,979
Get in here.

583
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:02,655
Sit down.

584
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:24,143
Where were we?

585
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:41,627
"The rustic manners of a prince

586
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:43,713
who disdained such glory,

587
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:47,499
and was insensible of such happiness,

588
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,002
soon disgusted

589
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,521
the delicacy of his subjects;

590
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,691
and the effeminate orientals

591
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,377
could neither imitate nor admire

592
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,579
the severe simplicity..."

593
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:02,415
"...which Julian always maintained

594
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,133
and sometimes affected."
