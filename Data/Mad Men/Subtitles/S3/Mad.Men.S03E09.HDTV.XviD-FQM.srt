00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,805
Mad Men 3x09
- Wee Small Hours -

3
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:41,892
Hello?

4
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:44,269
Do you ever pray
on a difficult problem?

5
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:47,627
Connie.

6
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,852
I had this revelation...

7
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:54,689
New York city is not
a domestic destination

8
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,064
like say Dallas.

9
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,559
I'm sorry. What?

10
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,505
God speaks to us.

11
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,872
We have an impulse
and we act on it.

12
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,940
- That's very interesting.
- <i>How do we know to do it?</i>

13
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,549
How do we know too something?

14
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,377
Instinct.

15
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,221
So you're just like a dog?

16
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,637
I knew the patina of the Waldorf

17
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,836
would shine over
all my domestic properties,

18
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,461
but it hasn't worked abroad.

19
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:31,890
I know I just gave you New York,
but can you help me with that?

20
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:36,280
You want me to take
your international business?

21
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,575
I want you to earn it.

22
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:42,411
A little bit of "wow,"
as a lady friend of mine used to say.

23
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,748
Let me think on that.

24
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:50,508
It sounds like pride, but I want Hiltons
all over the world, like missions.

25
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:53,881
I want a Hilton on the moon.
That's where we're headed.

26
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,400
America is wherever we look,

27
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,598
wherever we're going to be.

28
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,433
That's very good, Connie.

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,937
You're the one who said
that to me.

30
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,729
Well, I guess
it's not that memorable.

31
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:15,889
Write up a proposal for the New York
Hiltons as convention spaces

32
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:17,848
and send it over to me by noon.

33
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,847
- I'll take it on the plane.
- Done.

34
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:24,892
Goodbye.

35
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:36,283
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

36
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,516
I don't think the 4 A.M.
Feedings are over yet.

37
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:43,709
"I want what I want
when I want it,"

38
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,630
and you don't care
what it does to the rest of us.

39
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,768
Like someone else I know.

40
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,778
The baby's up every three hours.
Hilton only calls every four.

41
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,616
I think you like it.

42
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,201
What are you doing?

43
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,321
I can't sleep.

44
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,730
I'm going in.

45
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,490
- What are you doing?
- I'm running.

46
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,871
In the dark?

47
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,728
It's cool, it's quiet
and no one bothers me.

48
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,176
You're wrong about that.

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,779
Let me give you a ride.
Where are you going?

50
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:45,034
I'm going home,
and the whole idea is to run there.

51
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,454
Well, take a break.
Do you smoke?

52
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,708
- <i>The reverend Dr. Martin Luther King...</i>
- Take me up to ross lane.

53
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,642
<i>Christian leadership conference
spoke at the march.</i>

54
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,610
<i>I have a dream...</i>

55
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:01,384
<i>That my four little children...</i>

56
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,594
- Don't.
- <i>... will one day live in a nation</i>

57
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,917
<i>where they will not be judged
by the color</i>

58
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,653
<i>of their skin but by the content
of their character.</i>

59
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,802
<i>I have a dream today.</i>

60
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,524
<i>Two young women were
brutally murdered...</i>

61
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,528
When school starts, I'm going
to read it to the kids the first day.

62
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:26,640
Do you think
they can understand it?

63
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,944
I think they already know it

64
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:32,165
and it'd be nice for them
to hear an adult say it.

65
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,030
Who are you?

66
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,665
I mean...

67
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,225
Dumb or pure?

68
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,877
Running out here in the middle
of the night and I run into you.

69
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,444
How did that happen?

70
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,561
What are you doing on the road?

71
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,213
I don't know. I can't sleep.

72
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,570
- Right or left.
- Just let me out up here.

73
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,591
It's a nice house.

74
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,601
I rent the apartment
over the garage.

75
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:23,866
Have coffee with me.

76
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,552
You'll be late for work.

77
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,927
I'm always late.

78
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,281
It's coffee.

79
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,601
Maybe that's why you can't sleep...

80
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,181
Too much coffee.

81
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,095
Good morning.

82
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,127
Sorry.

83
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:02,796
How long have you been there?
I had no idea.

84
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,283
Can you get me some coffee, please?
And I need you to type this up

85
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:08,469
and get it to Hilton before
he leaves for europe.

86
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,360
Actually, he's going to California.

87
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,058
He already left two messages
on the service.

88
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,786
Do you want me to get him?

89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,390
This. Coffee. Hilton.

90
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,234
Of course.

91
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,614
Mr. Draper usually brings this in.

92
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,408
He left early.

93
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,035
- Can we go outside now?
- It's raining.

94
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,338
Go upstairs.

95
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,785
I did not sleep last night.

96
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,686
Go take a nap.
I'll shop in the afternoon.

97
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,974
It could either be
the view of the Acropolis,

98
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:48,322
or just these big columns,
like you're standing there.

99
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,654
Then below it
"Your window on the world."

100
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,489
"Hilton,"

101
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,366
"period."

102
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,189
That window looks as old
to me as those columns.

103
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,122
Did anybody look at a picture
of the Athens Hilton?

104
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:03,458
Sliding doors
don't read as windows.

105
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,412
And believe it or not, we're not allowed
to pretend that that's the view

106
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,790
from the window of the Hilton,
because it's not.

107
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,848
Other than that?

108
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,226
The tag is flat.

109
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,136
That one's yours.

110
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:18,306
That doesn't make it good.
If it's bad, don't use it.

111
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,019
What else?

112
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:25,731
There are 16 graphically perfect
reduced photographs

113
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,965
of Hilton hotels all on a grid,
a simple headline.

114
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,986
"You go. We'll meet you anywhere."

115
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,675
Now that I can finally
understand you,

116
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,108
I am less impressed
with what you have to say.

117
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,536
That's your work too.

118
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:44,582
Who is "we"?

119
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:46,387
"We" are Hilton.

120
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,299
And how do I know that?

121
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:51,677
Take out a magnifying glass
and look at one of those tiny hotels?

122
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:54,477
I write "Hilton"
very big under this greek.

123
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,105
There is no deadline.

124
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,149
I want to see work as you think of it.
Give me more ideas to reject.

125
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,811
I can't do this all by myself.

126
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,427
I'm telling you it's bad for me.

127
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,073
What's that supposed to mean?

128
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,333
And cut!

129
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,129
I think we've finally got it.

130
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,867
I told you... you had it the first
time if that's what you want.

131
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,414
And I told you
I want what you want.

132
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,614
Where is he supposed to be looking?

133
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,189
On to the horizon.

134
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,640
We want people
to focus on the Lucky.

135
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,454
This is what your father
signed off on.

136
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,771
- Let me see it again.
- Nathaniel, again, please.

137
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,020
- Watch through the camera.
- That's a good idea.

138
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:57,051
Action.

139
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,291
I just don't know
what he's looking at.

140
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,774
I want him staring
right at us at the end.

141
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,928
There's a style

142
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,740
for the draw on these spots,

143
00:11:16,865 --> 00:11:18,814
and it's stop, inhale,

144
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,759
thousand-yard stare.

145
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,930
Tell me what you think.

146
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,383
I think you're the client
and we should do what you want.

147
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,233
- It can make people very uncomfortable.
- Walter Cronkite does it every night.

148
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,278
Now let's take a risk together,
shall we, Sally?

149
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,302
Going again.

150
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:41,867
This time, Nathaniel,
on the draw look right in the lens.

151
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,724
We have to get a pencil case.

152
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:08,639
What's wrong with your pencil box?

153
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:10,614
How was the first day?

154
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,773
I wish I could've found the camera

155
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,865
just so we could see the difference
on your face

156
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,363
from when you left this morning
to when I picked you up.

157
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,053
- So you like your teacher?
- She's okay.

158
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,627
It's Mrs. Patton.
All they do is draw.

159
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:27,958
Is this today's mail?

160
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,235
- I'll get him.
- Would you?

161
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,320
You're so quiet.

162
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,920
You must be tired.

163
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,584
I'm not tired.

164
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,166
I really want a pencil case
to put in my loose-leaf.

165
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,005
We'll see.

166
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,142
<i>Lucky Strike,
the hard-working smoke</i>

167
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,186
<i>with that smooth and honest taste.</i>

168
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,319
Cut.

169
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,926
So it's a rhythm?

170
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,194
That's true.

171
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,817
Obviously it'll sound better
with the announcer's voice.

172
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,071
It sounded like you had
half of a pastrami in your mouth.

173
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:32,936
It's a scratch track. I didn't know you
were going to show it to the client.

174
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,193
I know I'm supposed
to stay away till the screening,

175
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:37,022
but I am fascinated
by this process.

176
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,775
You're thinking about getting out
of cigarettes and into the movies?

177
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,957
Not while my father's alive.

178
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,196
If we record the sound tonight,
we can probably finish this.

179
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,193
I heard you the first time.

180
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,069
I'll be in the booth.

181
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,919
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

182
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,255
Forget all that nonsense
I was saying before.

183
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,670
What are you talking about?

184
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:04,945
The movies,

185
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:06,321
my father.

186
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,554
Forgotten.

187
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,893
Sorry, but I had a long, wet lunch.

188
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:14,757
Really?

189
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,232
Too much to drink?

190
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,860
And other things.

191
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:19,933
Secretaries nowadays,

192
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,902
they don't give you a choice.
You know what I mean?

193
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:26,507
- I don't have a secretary.
- How'd my shot turn out?

194
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,822
I'm not sure.

195
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,573
I think it's gonna feel strange.

196
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:31,785
Lucky Strike has
a way of doing things.

197
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,410
Look at this.

198
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:38,884
Yeah, see?

199
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,879
I don't think that's so bad.

200
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:50,492
Come on.

201
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,015
He's not coming back for a while.

202
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,811
I'll lock the door.

203
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,730
I'm married.

204
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:00,815
So am I.

205
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,005
There's been a misunderstanding.

206
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:06,363
I know what I know.

207
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,993
Jerry should have the tracks done.

208
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:18,959
You can see the whole thing
tomorrow or when it's done.

209
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,604
I'll probably be busy tomorrow.

210
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,095
I've got it.

211
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:28,932
You're at work.

212
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:31,182
That's too bad.

213
00:15:57,042 --> 00:16:00,495
<i>"Henry, I'm so pleased there's
a place that I can write to you."</i>

214
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,992
<i>"The children are finally
back in school now"</i>

215
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:05,551
<i>"and I must admit that I like
the idea of looking forward"</i>

216
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:07,304
<i>"to the mail's arrival every day."</i>

217
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:08,805
<i>"Well, not every day."</i>

218
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:14,681
<i>"I don't write many letters anymore,
so I apologize in advance"</i>

219
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,224
<i>"if I'm unable to accurately
express my thoughts."</i>

220
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,705
<i>"But I do have thoughts,"</i>

221
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,918
<i>"and I suppose I wonder too much
where you are and what you're doing."</i>

222
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,362
<i>"We've only met three times,
you know that?"</i>

223
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,693
<i>"Isn't that strange?"</i>

224
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:35,827
<i>"I wish I had a clearer picture
of you in my mind."</i>

225
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:38,908
<i>"Anyway, that's all
I have to report."</i>

226
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,146
<i>"I hope to hear from you. B."</i>

227
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,739
- Don't touch it.
- I've seen this one.

228
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:59,423
- It whitens.
- It's not about what you want to watch.

229
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,187
I have to make sure
they run every commercial.

230
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,607
My mother-in-law says
I look like Perry Mason.

231
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,820
It's not a compliment.
It means she thinks you're fat.

232
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,398
Harry, it's Lee Garner.

233
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,913
I knew you'd still be there.

234
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,667
- <i>You work hard, don't you?</i>
- For you? You bet.

235
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,774
I don't want to keep you,

236
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:28,963
but I have a bit of a problem.

237
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,465
What's wrong?

238
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:33,776
It's that Salvatore Fella,
the director.

239
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:36,425
He's no good.

240
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:37,930
I'd like him gone.

241
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,849
What happened?

242
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,775
I can't work with him.

243
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,103
Get rid of him.

244
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:44,813
I can't do that.

245
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,090
Excuse me?

246
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,484
No, I'm not... really, I can't.

247
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,360
Pete and Roger handle your account.

248
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,721
No no.

249
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,238
No no no, Harry.

250
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,602
<i>I want you to take care of this</i>

251
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,577
and I want you to keep it
just between us.

252
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,872
<i>Crane, are you there?</i>

253
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,089
Listen, Lee.

254
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,708
I hope you know the commercial's
turning out beautiful.

255
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,171
You really have an eye.

256
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,464
I do, do I?

257
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,651
Are you enjoying the city?

258
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:14,776
I am.

259
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,344
Plenty to do.

260
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,342
You have a good night.
I should get back to work.

261
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,268
Sorry to trouble you.
Good night.

262
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:24,777
Good night.

263
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,402
- What was that?
- You don't want to know.

264
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:31,401
I think I do.

265
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,194
I can't tell you.

266
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:35,724
Now I really do.

267
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,450
Lee Garner Jr. asked me
to get rid of Sal.

268
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,155
- What did he do?
- I didn't ask.

269
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,526
He was drunk as a skunk
and he's scary to begin with.

270
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,092
What are you gonna do,
call Campbell?

271
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,951
That's the other thing.
He said to keep it between us.

272
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,026
What are you gonna do?

273
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,716
I'm not gonna panic and do something
stupid like I usually do.

274
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,975
That's a good start.

275
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,918
I can't really do anything, can I?

276
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,387
He was really drunk.

277
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,638
The show's on.

278
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:06,042
Great, I missed
all the commercials.

279
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:23,285
- Hello?
- Don, it's Conrad Hilton.

280
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:24,969
Is it?

281
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,029
Now don't be like that.

282
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,657
I know it's a privilege
to call you at home.

283
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,501
I don't think I've worn it out.

284
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,463
It's 11:30.

285
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,883
It's not a problem.

286
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,842
Can you come have a drink with me?

287
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:40,970
Right now?

288
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,140
You can say no.
I've heard it before.

289
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,393
And for all you know,
you're not the first person I asked.

290
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,036
I'll be there.

291
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:52,459
Give me an hour.

292
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,548
So what is that, moonshine?

293
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:03,687
No, but it is from prohibition.

294
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,685
I have two cases

295
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:08,330
and they both say
"hair tonic" on the side.

296
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,640
I remember this.

297
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:33,001
I think you know I'm in
a bit of a crisis tonight.

298
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:34,940
I didn't know that.

299
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,343
I think about my business
day and night

300
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,778
and I'm a harsh critic,

301
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,453
especially of myself.

302
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:47,992
And sometimes
it collects and I feel bad.

303
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,627
And then I realize

304
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:57,093
maybe that's the reason
I'm so lonesome.

305
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,191
You might be working too much.

306
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,430
I'm not working enough.

307
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,905
It's my purpose in life

308
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,103
to bring America

309
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:10,694
to the world,

310
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,021
whether they like it or not.

311
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:16,469
You know,

312
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:19,453
we are a force of good, Don,

313
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:21,668
because we have God.

314
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:24,990
The communists don't.

315
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,593
It's their most

316
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,704
important belief.
Did you know that?

317
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,755
I'm not an expert.

318
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:34,906
Generosity.

319
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,379
The Marshall plan...
You remember that.

320
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:43,092
Everyone who saw our ways

321
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,638
wanted to be us.

322
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm glad you're telling me this.

323
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,990
After all the things
we threw at Khrushchev,

324
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,186
you know what made him fall apart?

325
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,782
He couldn't get into Disneyland.

326
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:06,658
That's good.

327
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:08,855
You never heard that?

328
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:11,768
I did, but when I hear you say it

329
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:13,345
it sounds beautiful.

330
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:17,646
I don't want any politics

331
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,587
in my campaign. You know that.

332
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:23,564
But there should be

333
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,419
goodness

334
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:28,568
and...

335
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,307
confidence.

336
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,760
Thanks for listening to me, Don.

337
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:40,984
You know, sometimes I look
around here,

338
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:43,564
and I think

339
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:45,767
"by golly,"

340
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,880
"I'm king Midas."

341
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:51,643
Stop it.

342
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,459
You're not.

343
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:01,456
You're my angel, you know that?

344
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,130
You're like a son.

345
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:06,646
In fact,

346
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:10,805
sometimes you're more
than a son to me,

347
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,779
because you didn't have

348
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:15,393
what they had

349
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,096
and you understand.

350
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,145
Thank you.

351
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:31,397
I mean it.

352
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:54,806
Come in, come in.

353
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,603
I drove all the way down
to get the mail,

354
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,144
and then I turned around
and I debated it.

355
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:02,272
I went past the exit a dozen times.

356
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,858
My girl is due back.

357
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,620
I know I shouldn't be here.

358
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:10,989
It's just I wanted to see you.

359
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,411
I wasn't thinking.

360
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,289
What do I say? Why are you here?

361
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,333
There you are.

362
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,439
Carla, this is Henry Francis.

363
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:26,835
- He works for governor Rockefeller.
- It's nice to meet you.

364
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:29,800
So anyway...

365
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,678
I think this is an excellent venue
for a fundraiser.

366
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:36,516
Good.

367
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,143
- I'll have to check with my husband.
- Of course.

368
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,729
Carla, will you show
Mr. Francis out?

369
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,626
I think I left the bath running.

370
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,874
- A pleasure to meet you.
- You as well.

371
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:10,942
I... I can't get this.
Lucy, do you mind?

372
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,669
Jesus. Knock it off.

373
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:23,563
It's a Lucky Strike commercial.
It's got three cuts in it.

374
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,656
So the Hillbilly says,

375
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,817
"that ain't my finger."

376
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:31,733
I'm gonna have to hear
the beginning of that joke.

377
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Lee?

378
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Lee!

379
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,501
- What's going on?
- I... I have no idea.

380
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:48,324
Does someone know what's going on?
Speak up.

381
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
I know.

382
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,720
Lee Garner Jr. called me
a couple of days ago. I'm sorry.

383
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,028
- Why is he calling you?
- I don't know.

384
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,093
He did and he told me
to get rid of Sal.

385
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:59,056
What?

386
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,391
And you made an executive
decision to do nothing?

387
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,823
He was really drunk.
I thought it would blow over.

388
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:05,146
I didn't even think he'd remember.

389
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:07,439
When you get in trouble,
you call mommy and daddy.

390
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,692
He told me not to tell you,
so what was I supposed to do?

391
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:13,656
Everyone's an account man. What exactly
do you think we do here, Crane?

392
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,946
We handle clients.

393
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,241
He wouldn't say a word.
He just left.

394
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:20,104
Sal, you're fired.

395
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:23,831
- Are you serious?
- Lee Garner Jr. wants you fired.

396
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,739
We're gonna find out what he wants
to do with you, imbecile.

397
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:31,923
Oh, God.

398
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:33,655
What the hell happened?

399
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:36,301
What is going on?

400
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:40,473
Now you're gonna use your dying breath
to tell Don to fix this.

401
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,439
Lee Garner has a problem with creative,
let Don solve it.

402
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:46,155
He does it all now anyway.

403
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:47,781
Now!

404
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,655
- What did lee say to you?
- Nothing. I have to talk to Don.

405
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,167
- Let me talk to Don.
- I'm doing as I'm told.

406
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,281
Is he busy?

407
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,666
I can see you and I can hear you.
What do you want?

408
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,457
Who died?

409
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,292
I... screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.

410
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,253
What?

411
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,756
- How do I explain this?
- He told Harry to fire me.

412
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,050
I didn't, but now Roger did.

413
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,600
- Roger did what?
- He fired me.

414
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,265
Roger said to tell you to fix it.
Those are his words.

415
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:24,593
Fantastic.

416
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:29,062
That's a $25 million account
you stuck your nose in, Crane.

417
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:33,622
Just get out.

418
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,533
What happened?

419
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,333
Lee Garner got drunk

420
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:47,343
and he told Harry to fire me.
Then Roger got angry and he did.

421
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:50,359
I think if I get away from Lucky Strike
and lay low from Roger for a day or two,

422
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:51,544
everything will be fine.

423
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:54,398
I understand what just happened.
What happened with the cut?

424
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:56,172
The commercial's fine.

425
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,176
Sal, something must've happened.
I can't help you unless you tell me.

426
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:05,223
- We... had a misunderstanding.
- Jesus. I'm not gonna ask again.

427
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:13,069
He was drunk

428
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:16,482
and he cornered me
in the editing room.

429
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:20,219
- Cornered you?
- Yes.

430
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,086
And I backed him off,

431
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,820
I told him I was married,
he was embarrassed and he left.

432
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:31,792
You must've been really shocked.

433
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:32,930
I was,

434
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,181
believe me.

435
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,569
But nothing happened

436
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:40,675
because nothing could've happened
because you're married.

437
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,012
Don, I swear on my mother's life.

438
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:46,654
Are you sure you want to do that?

439
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:52,104
Who do you think you're talking to?

440
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,504
I guess I was just supposed to do
whatever he wanted?

441
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:58,152
What... what if it was some girl?

442
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,807
That would depend on what kind of girl
it was and what I knew about her.

443
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:06,431
You people.

444
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,656
I didn't do anything
but turn him down.

445
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:15,956
He's a bully.

446
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:20,631
Lucky Strike can
shut off our lights.

447
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:32,061
I think you know that this is
the way this has to be.

448
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,430
You'll do fine.

449
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,849
Get me Lee Garner Jr.

450
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,430
I said I don't want salad.

451
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,058
Watch your tone, young man.
Carla works for me, not you.

452
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,644
What do you want instead?

453
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,534
You might as well call it a day.

454
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,110
Thank you.

455
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,799
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi.

456
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,533
How was your day?

457
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,234
Not good.

458
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,184
I didn't want to bother you with it,
but that man dropped by today

459
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,672
from the governor's office.
Carla met him.

460
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,847
Francine sent him over here.

461
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:50,805
They want to have a fundraiser,
but her house isn't big enough.

462
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,893
I don't care, as long
as I don't have to go. When is it?

463
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:56,729
Well, I should be going.

464
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,816
Soon. Next week, I think.

465
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:03,068
A fundraiser for Rockefeller.

466
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,710
For the campaign.

467
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,925
I'm gonna go lay down.

468
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,051
- Good night, Carla.
- Good night.

469
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:11,911
Good night, children.

470
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:13,829
- Good night.
- Bye.

471
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,589
Good night, Mrs. Draper.

472
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:30,675
If you're here,
do I have to be here?

473
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,598
Because I'm leaving.

474
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,517
No, go ahead.

475
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,393
Good night, boss.

476
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,736
- Henry Francis.
- <i>Hello.</i>

477
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:52,492
<i>I thought I'd get the service.</i>

478
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:55,246
This is Betty... Draper.

479
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,049
I know that.

480
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:59,541
Listen, I shouldn't have
come by like that.

481
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,487
- I hope I'm not calling too late.
- <i>No, you're not.</i>

482
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,838
I checked with my husband
about the fundraiser.

483
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:08,384
The fundraiser?

484
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,861
Yes, we'd be glad to do that.

485
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:12,424
How's Tuesday the 17th?

486
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,681
Can you make it then?
Is that good for you?

487
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:19,018
I guess you're going
through with this.

488
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:20,942
I had to.

489
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,900
I'll have my girl call you tomorrow
to make it official.

490
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:27,940
I look forward to it.

491
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:30,507
Let me know what's usually
provided by the host.

492
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,815
Sure.

493
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:34,754
Goodbye.

494
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:36,912
Good night, Betty.

495
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,629
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

496
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,065
are magnificent destinations

497
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,977
and that's really been the focus
of almost every campaign

498
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:53,690
you've had up till now...

499
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,181
How to lure the american
traveler abroad.

500
00:32:57,253 --> 00:33:00,853
What more do we need than a picture
of Athens to get our hearts racing?

501
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:04,388
And yet the average
american experiences

502
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:08,006
a level of luxury that belongs
only to kings

503
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,527
in most of the world.

504
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:11,992
We're not chauvinists.

505
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,753
We just have expectations.

506
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:20,262
Now there's one word that promises
the thrill of international travel

507
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,916
with the comfort of home:

508
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,003
"Hilton."

509
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,548
"How do you say ice water
in italian?"

510
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:32,124
"Hilton."

511
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:36,336
"How do you say
fresh towels in farsi?

512
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,629
"Hilton."

513
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,926
"How do you say hamburger
in japanese?

514
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,188
"Hilton."

515
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,942
"Hilton."

516
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,781
It's the same in every language.

517
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,642
Maybe fried chicken.

518
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,542
I don't like the sound
of "hamburger" and "Hilton."

519
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:59,118
Besides, "hamburger" is
already a foreign word.

520
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,212
We'll see.

521
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:11,817
It's good.

522
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:14,760
Very good.

523
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:16,845
It's clever, yet friendly.

524
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,505
It draws you in.

525
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,975
But what about the moon?

526
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:25,854
- Excuse me?
- There's nothing about the moon.

527
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,357
Right now,
that's not an actual destination.

528
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,557
That wasn't the point.

529
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,692
I said I wanted Hilton on the moon.

530
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:35,014
I couldn't have been
more clear about it.

531
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:39,562
I'll admit I misunderstood that.

532
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:42,663
I'm sure there's a way
to fit that into this.

533
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,859
Well, isn't this something?

534
00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:55,504
I'd like to speak
with Don in private.

535
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,610
This is a good campaign...
One of the best.

536
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,774
It's modern, it's witty,
it's eye-catching.

537
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,285
- It will change your business.
- Calm down.

538
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,497
I'm going to speak
very honestly with you.

539
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:24,520
I don't think folks do that often.

540
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:26,080
Probably scared.

541
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,707
Or they trust my work.

542
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,209
You want me to just say yes
to everything you do?

543
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,652
Most ad men believe
that clients are the thing

544
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,526
that gets in the way of good work.

545
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,883
I've never experienced that.

546
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,216
You did not give me what I wanted.

547
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,012
I'm deeply disappointed, Don.

548
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,384
This is a great campaign.

549
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,321
Fine.

550
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:55,473
What do you want from me? Love?

551
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:56,948
Your work is good.

552
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,914
But when I say I want the moon,

553
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,410
I expect the moon.

554
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:18,925
I said if he ran, I'd support him.

555
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:21,037
I haven't decided yet.

556
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,056
I voted for Kennedy.
I'll probably vote for him again.

557
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:28,536
What a nice turnout.

558
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,134
- Where's Henry Francis?
- I don't know.

559
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,786
Someone's supposed to talk.

560
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,897
I don't know anything about Rockefeller.
That's why I did this.

561
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,683
I want to know how he's going
to deal with the south.

562
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,768
Do you know how bad it must
be for the negroes

563
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:43,115
to descend on Washington
like that just to be heard?

564
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,257
Segregation is uncivilized.
It's that simple.

565
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,674
You know what my father says
about the south?

566
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,971
It's not 1963, it's 1863.

567
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:55,584
Thank you. Mrs. Draper,

568
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,880
I'm Elsa Kittridge.
I work with Mr. Francis.

569
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,801
Pleasure to meet you.
I assume he's been delayed.

570
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:04,512
Actually he asked that I address
the group on behalf of the governor.

571
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:08,572
That's disappointing.

572
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:11,791
I don't think it's going
to help your fundraising

573
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,101
when you promise one thing
and deliver another.

574
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,208
Perhaps you're right,
but he seemed to think

575
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,936
I was a better match to the group.
And I am extremely informed.

576
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,574
In fact, I'm the person
who briefs Mr. Francis.

577
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:29,412
I think you'll see I won't embarrass
you in front of your friends.

578
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,250
Please, begin when ever you want.

579
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,771
No, you begin, dear.

580
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:45,710
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper.

581
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,084
Welcome to my home.

582
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,722
- We're going to listen to...
- Elsa Kittridge,

583
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:52,619
associate in the governor's
information office.

584
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,333
First I would like to dispel the rumor

585
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,081
that there is a mandatory
contribution tonight.

586
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:04,156
This is a taking of a pulse,
an exchange of ideas.

587
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:24,471
Please see that
we're not disturbed.

588
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:38,190
<i>Mr. Francis, do you need anything?</i>

589
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,800
No, Marjorie, I dropped something.

590
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:44,709
- Where were you last night?
- Calm down.

591
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,284
Why didn't you come?

592
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,985
Why did you send that...
that woman?

593
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:52,203
I watched the door
all night like ASAP.

594
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,414
I'm sorry, but I wanted
you to come to me.

595
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,395
The ego!

596
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,711
Would you listen to me?
You had to come to me.

597
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,213
And why is that?

598
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:06,468
Because you're married.

599
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,210
No, Henry.

600
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:38,088
What's wrong?

601
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,025
Please.

602
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:43,085
We're locked in this office.

603
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:46,317
What? On the desk?

604
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,385
On the couch?

605
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,275
We should get a room somewhere.

606
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
No.

607
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:54,587
It's tawdry.

608
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,210
I'm sorry.

609
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,697
I'm very sorry

610
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:05,610
I started this.

611
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,564
I don't know what you want.

612
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Goodbye.

613
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
<i>Mr. Sterling's here to see you.</i>

614
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,306
Send him in.

615
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,352
I heard Conrad Hilton left
this building in a huff yesterday.

616
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,063
Who told you that?

617
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,033
You've got your face
so deep in Hilton's lap,

618
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:45,777
you're ignoring everything else.

619
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,235
Everything's under control.

620
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,030
You won't even let me meet the man.
What do you think accounts does,

621
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,274
besides limit your brilliance?

622
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:57,329
I'd tell you, but I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

623
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,837
Keep joking about it.

624
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:01,236
We've had two clients
in one week leave here angry...

625
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,627
Important clients.

626
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,537
Is that what you want
this place to be known for?

627
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:08,689
That and some guy losing
his foot in a lawnmower?

628
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,744
I want to put you on notice
you are in over your head.

629
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,785
<i>These children...</i>

630
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:24,714
<i>Unoffending, innocent</i>

631
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,763
<i>and beautiful...</i>

632
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,800
<i>Were the victims of one</i>

633
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,652
<i>of the most vicious</i>

634
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:34,403
<i>and tragic crimes</i>

635
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:37,399
<i>ever perpetrated</i>

636
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:39,287
<i>against humanity.</i>

637
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:44,587
You can leave it on your station.
I don't mind.

638
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:47,240
- It's all right.
- What was that?

639
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:51,758
The funeral service
for the little girls in Birmingham.

640
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,885
It's so horrifying.

641
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:00,005
Are you okay?

642
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,643
Do you need a day off?

643
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,349
No, I'm fine.

644
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,010
Thank you.

645
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:12,864
I hate to say this, but it's really
made me wonder about civil rights.

646
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:15,906
Maybe it's not supposed
to happen right now.

647
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:22,225
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello.

648
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:25,792
You just missed bedtime.
They're probably still awake.

649
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,198
No, don't bother with dinner.

650
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,570
We've got chinese takeout.

651
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:44,850
Listen, Marty needs me
to look over this work.

652
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:47,001
Don't wait up for me.

653
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,899
I love you too.

654
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:36,699
Betts.

655
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:39,513
What?

656
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:42,504
Hilton just called.

657
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,161
I'm going in.

658
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,917
I didn't hear the phone.

659
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,489
Go back to sleep.

660
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:21,803
- Someone's going to see you.
- Then let me in.

661
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:40,038
This is nice.

662
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:45,807
What can I do for you?

663
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,185
I don't know. I wanted to talk.

664
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:52,139
Right.

665
00:44:52,702 --> 00:44:55,025
Says the man
as he unbuckles his pants.

666
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:57,672
What do you want me to say?

667
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:00,070
You've been flirting
with me for months.

668
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:02,387
So what?

669
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,465
So I can't stop thinking about you.

670
00:45:05,824 --> 00:45:07,874
Because I'm new and different.

671
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:11,249
Or maybe I'm exactly the same.

672
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,519
Tell me you've run past
that stretch of highway

673
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:16,656
in the past two weeks
and not thought of me,

674
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:18,797
not looked for me.

675
00:45:21,877 --> 00:45:24,184
But then I have the luxury
of that last half-mile home

676
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,861
where I go through every step
of the future until it ends.

677
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,934
I know exactly how it ends.

678
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,202
So what?

679
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:36,329
You live two miles from here.

680
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:39,903
Your daughter was my student.
I've seen your wife in the market.

681
00:45:40,622 --> 00:45:42,947
I don't think you've done
this before this way.

682
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:54,888
I want you.

683
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:58,187
I don't care.

684
00:45:58,312 --> 00:46:00,381
Doesn't that mean anything
to someone like you?
