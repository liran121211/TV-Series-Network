1
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,086
Dick Whitman, you watch where you're going.

2
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,351
You're going to break your neck.

3
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,692
You going to cry or get up?

4
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,369
I'm getting up, Uncle Mack.

5
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,065
Good. There's someone
who wants to meet you.

6
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,802
What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,776
There was lots of screaming.

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,245
Always is.

9
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,510
The Lord has given us a blessing.

10
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,780
You have a new brother.

11
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,887
He ain't my brother.

12
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,892
Of course he is.
You got the same daddy.

13
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,461
Isn't he beautiful?

14
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,827
I named him Adam after the first man.

15
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,278
Daddy!

16
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,108
Don, are you all right?

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,886
Happy Mother's Day.

18
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,337
This is fascinating.

19
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,411
It's better than the Hollywood version.

20
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,106
It's certainly dirtier.

21
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,116
Well, Joan Crawford is not what she was.

22
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,310
You know, honestly,

23
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,412
I found her eyebrows completely unnerving,

24
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,081
like a couple of...

25
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,160
caterpillars just pasted there.

26
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:54,594
Her standing next to Suzy Parker
as if they were the same species.

27
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,898
Well, some men like eyebrows,

28
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,734
and all men like Joan Crawford.

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,934
Salvatore couldn't stop talking about her.

30
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:10,744
To think, one of the great beauties,
and there she is, so old.

31
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,819
I'd just like to disappear at that point.

32
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
It makes perfect sense.

33
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,716
I promise you, Bets,

34
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,853
the first sign of crow's feet,
and I'll put you on an ice floe.

35
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,932
Or would you prefer to be
my gal in the iron mask?

36
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,928
Did you have a nice Mother's Day?

37
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,002
It was lovely.

38
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,079
My mother was at least two years older
than whatever Joan Crawford says she is,

39
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,240
and she was still very fetching.

40
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,010
I'd like to think that
she'd stand up very well

41
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,988
as a prediction of my
eventual appearance.

42
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,991
Bets, don't.

43
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,760
No melancholy.

44
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,301
I'm allowed to be sentimental
on Mother's Day.

45
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,199
But it's your Mother's Day, not hers.

46
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,104
I'm just saying that my mother
looked handsome.

47
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,742
Actually, vivacious
and positively cheerful,

48
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,779
right up to her end.

49
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,944
It's good remembrance.

50
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,611
Dr. Wayne suggested a book which...

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,781
says that it's part
of the mourning process.

52
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,689
Dr. Wayne.

53
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,991
I do think it's helping.

54
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,292
So you're cured?

55
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,594
I don't know how they tell that.

56
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,897
When their vacation house is paid for.

57
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,602
Don't deride him.

58
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,345
Mourning is just extended self-pity.

59
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,644
In New Guinea,

60
00:05:52,752 --> 00:06:00,090
pygmies grind up their ancestors
and drink the powder in a beer.

61
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,720
And a model culture at that, pygmies.

62
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,424
Did you know Michelangelo
was painting the Sistine ceiling

63
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:11,731
when those people were still
living in caves discovering fire?

64
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,965
I didn't know that.

65
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,700
Well, it's true.

66
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,174
Introduction to Basic Anthropology.

67
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,773
What about...

68
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,112
Advanced Reproduction?

69
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,016
How are your studies
progressing in that?

70
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,385
Completed.

71
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,822
I got an A, actually.

72
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,823
You did?

73
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,757
Yep, I did.

74
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,296
I flunked the whole thing.

75
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,026
Well, that's because
you got caught cheating.

76
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,578
Get the light.

77
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,853
I want you so much.

78
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,823
I thought about it all day.

79
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,299
Me, too.

80
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,203
No, I mean it.

81
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,702
It's all I think about...

82
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,074
every day.

83
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,116
Your car coming down the driveway.

84
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,252
I put the kids to bed early.

85
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,987
I make a grocery list.
I cook butterscotch pudding.

86
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,059
I never let my hands idle.

87
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,425
Brushing my hair,

88
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,694
drinking my milk...

89
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,996
and it's all in a kind of fog

90
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,799
because I can't stop
thinking about this.

91
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,406
I want you so badly.

92
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,208
You have me.

93
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,550
You do.

94
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,283
Ah, Don.

95
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,790
You remember Nick Rodis
from Olympic Cruise Lines.

96
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,793
Nick, did you ever add
that second deck of portholes?

97
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,955
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.

98
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,125
This is Urine Ben Shulhai
from The Israel Ministry of Tourism.

99
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,497
It is pronounced "Yoram. "

100
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,570
Of course.

101
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,195
And this young lady is Lily Meyer.

102
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,671
Pleasure to meet you.

103
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,105
And you.

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,076
Caviar, blinis, mai tais.

105
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,079
We're thinking of a land of exotic luxury.

106
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,048
We'd like to think that if Beirut
is the Paris of the Middle East,

107
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,914
Haifa can be the Rome.

108
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,578
It's an exciting idea.

109
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,916
Of course we should keep in mind

110
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,254
that Paris has the Eiffel Tower
and Rome has the Coliseum.

111
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,793
And Tel Avenue is about to have a Hilton.

112
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,056
Olympic is charting
our most luxurious liner

113
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,725
all along the wondrous ports
of the Israeli Riviera.

114
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,292
We are going to visit
Mr. Bernbach down the street,

115
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,272
but some of us
find his humor to be kitsch.

116
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,832
We thought we would try
a traditional way as well.

117
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,779
Sterling Cooper doesn't
like to think of itself as traditional.

118
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:47,842
Maybe that is the wrong word.
My English is not so good.

119
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,616
Glamour, like glamorous... that's the word.

120
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,281
We saw your awards.

121
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,053
We were impressed
with your work on Rio de Janeiro.

122
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,526
You're not thinking of putting

123
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,065
a 150-foot statue of Jesus
in Tel Aviv, are you?

124
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,031
Because that's how we sold Rio.

125
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,127
This book has been
on the best-seller list

126
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,069
for two years in the States,

127
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,507
and is soon to be a major motion picture
starring Paul Newman.

128
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,241
America has a love affair with Israel,

129
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,046
and we would like to bring
the two parties together.

130
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,519
Well, you certainly
saved me some legwork.

131
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,090
All I have is the Bible.

132
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,056
Let's stay away from that.

133
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,893
So, your ideal tourist.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,592
What's his yearly salary?

135
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,668
Whatever you make.

136
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,205
They always say that.

137
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,816
Well, look who's here:
A couple of angels.

138
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,447
Do we have lunch today?

139
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,288
No, darling, we're going
to get Margaret a haircut.

140
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,828
A haircut?

141
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,419
Oh, I like your ponytail, squirt.

142
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,623
It makes you look young.

143
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,401
I like your hair, Daddy.
It makes you look old.

144
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,699
We just have to find the right place.

145
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,900
Ginger?

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,704
I cut my own hair.

147
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,205
You picked her.

148
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,846
Don't you two make a handsome couple.

149
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,112
Honestly, I don't go for handsome.

150
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,249
Mona, Margaret.

151
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,518
What brings you below 59th Street?

152
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,786
Margaret, say hello.

153
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,330
Hello, Mr. Draper.

154
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,066
Oh, Mona, aren't you lucky?

155
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,931
Mother and daughter on the town.

156
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,504
Where are the girls
getting their hair done these days?

157
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,232
By girls, you mean Brigitte Bardot?

158
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,932
Because that's what I'm seeing.

159
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,136
As long as she can pin
a hat on it for church.

160
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,008
You are going to love this man.

161
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,809
I will make you an appointment. Come on.

162
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,949
Bye, Don.

163
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,077
Roger, sweetheart.

164
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,657
She used to love being in my office.

165
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,354
Her haircut is the least
of Margaret's problems.

166
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,490
She's dated what, two boys?

167
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,831
One of them joined the service,
the other one committed suicide.

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,802
She doesn't want to go to college.

169
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,169
Doesn't want to work.

170
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,833
Not interested in charity.

171
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,312
I don't know what we did wrong.

172
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,315
We gave her everything she wanted,
and she's still useless.

173
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,611
You're being too hard on her.

174
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,879
She's a young girl.

175
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,955
When I was her age,
I rode a tramp steamer

176
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,614
from Bar Harbor to Hilton Head.

177
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,952
I bet it was a yacht.

178
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,493
Someone still has to sail those things.

179
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,290
I think Margaret reminds you of you.

180
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,727
You're both spoiled.

181
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,889
Zip.

182
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,696
Come back to bed.

183
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,138
We can stay here all afternoon.

184
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,005
You don't have to go back to work.

185
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,873
I do. Zip.

186
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,279
You like the pearl necklace I gave you?

187
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,372
It's gorgeous.

188
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,818
Aren't you even going to have any of this?

189
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:15,451
Look, we've got Oysters Rockefeller,
Beef Wellington, Napoleons.

190
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,826
If we leave this lunch alone,
it'll take over Europe.

191
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,592
I don't like eating in here.

192
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,795
Food that close to the bed
reminds me of a hospital.

193
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,997
If you had your own apartment,
we could go to your place.

194
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,664
You could cook for me.

195
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,971
Don't you like things the way they are?

196
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,011
Are you kidding?

197
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,014
This has been the best year of my life.

198
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,174
Do you have any idea

199
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,514
how unhappy I was before I met you?

200
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,852
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

201
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:52,921
I'm just getting tired of all the...
sneaking around.

202
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,522
Aren't you?

203
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,064
Roger, I know as much about men
as you know about advertising,

204
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,368
and I know that the sneaking around
is your favorite part.

205
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,342
You know, I have a lot of favorite parts.

206
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,870
I'd like to get you...

207
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,973
a little fourth floor walk-up somewhere

208
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,382
with no doors, no windows,

209
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,750
and lock you up for a week.

210
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,724
That's tempting.

211
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,420
But I like hotels.

212
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,293
You leave with what you came in with.

213
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,992
And little soaps. I love those.

214
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,760
I wish I knew what you wanted, Joanie.

215
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,266
I love this, Roger,

216
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,403
but a week is a considerable length of time,
and I have my own world.

217
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,244
I go out, and I have parties,
and I have friends over...

218
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,943
Male friends?

219
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,314
Yes.

220
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,478
I don't want to hear this.

221
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,988
Carol and I have this nice little rotation.

222
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,855
Carol. The disaster.

223
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,518
I've known Carol since college,

224
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,062
and she's been a good friend,

225
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,495
and she's bright, and she's neat.

226
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,827
So you think you'd be lonely.

227
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,002
I think it would be
half as much fun alone.

228
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,595
You could get a bird.

229
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,867
They're fairly neat for animals.

230
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,271
Roger, if you had your way,

231
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,351
I would be stranded
in some paperweight

232
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,282
with my legs stuck in the air.

233
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,581
Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,451
You're just gonna paint
that picture and go, huh?

235
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,363
Can't we... just enjoy this?

236
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:40,871
I mean, we both know I'll eventually find
a more permanent situation,

237
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:45,603
and you'll find a new model.

238
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,169
The '61s are coming out soon.

239
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,273
I hear the fins are bigger next year.

240
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,317
Whatever you want, Red.

241
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,740
I see why they want the guns.

242
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,778
It's tough to compete

243
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,610
with Bermuda only three hours away.

244
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,242
It helps if they stop blowing up hotels.

245
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,254
Oh, kill me, you busty Jewess.

246
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,960
Maybe we should try and exploit
the danger instead of fighting it.

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,527
Travel as adventure.

248
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,061
Or how about this?

249
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,497
Average American family of three
standing on shore, suitcases in hand.

250
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,296
The Red Sea parts before them.

251
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,066
On the other side
waits a gleaming four-star resort.

252
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,038
Shouldn't you see the Promised Land?

253
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,973
Take religion out.

254
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,103
They've got plenty of
Stations of the Cross traffic.

255
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,047
I've skimmed this research,
and the whole thing's pretty red.

256
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,642
These communes, kibbutzes.

257
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,982
It's positively Soviet.

258
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,755
Except the Daughters
of the American Revolution

259
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,588
are shuttling this book
up and down Fifth Avenue.

260
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,025
It's a good story.

261
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,221
They start in these prison camps.

262
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,797
Like, real prisoners.

263
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,867
Then the next thing you know,
they're in the desert, armed to the teeth,

264
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,062
cutting their way through the enemy,
dying for the cause.

265
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,695
And then they have a government.

266
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,467
A commie government.

267
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,542
Made my mother cry.

268
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:29,444
So, we have a quasi-communist state
where women have guns,

269
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,106
and it's filled with Jews.

270
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,547
Well, not completely filled.

271
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,414
Let's not forget that there are also Arabs.

272
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,112
They've got oranges.

273
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,518
As far as I can see,

274
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,251
the biggest thing
this place has going for it:

275
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,055
The people are good-looking.

276
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,995
The Jews there don't
look like the Jews here.

277
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,566
Have you been to the Diamond District?

278
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,466
All right. I have to make
a couple phone calls.

279
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,630
Let's pick this up later.

280
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,243
Peggy, will you get me
a private line, please?

281
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,212
Right away, Mr. Draper.

282
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,459
<i>Donald Draper, Line 2.</i>

283
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,805
I debated not taking the call.

284
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,315
I'm glad you did. I need to see you.

285
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,318
I don't think that's a good idea.

286
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,680
<i>It's business.</i>

287
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,347
Meet me for a drink.

288
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,788
I'm busy this evening.

289
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,883
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

290
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,360
<i>I should still be able to talk to you.</i>

291
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,862
<i>Give me credit for that.</i>

292
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,498
Lunch. Tomorrow.

293
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,695
Lunch.

294
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,373
<i>The Tea Room at The Pierre, 12:15.</i>

295
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,805
Message received.

296
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,365
Oh, it's so muggy tonight.

297
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,732
Did you just get a library card?

298
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,171
I rarely see you read anything

299
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,005
that doesn't have a manila folder
wrapped around it.

300
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,380
You should clean the gutters.

301
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,744
This weekend.

302
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,910
Is that good?

303
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,788
There's less action than I thought.

304
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,915
I thought it was a romance.

305
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,719
You know, the first boy
I ever kissed was Jewish.

306
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,556
How did that happen?

307
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,898
My friend Deirdre Shaw
was friends with a Jewish girl,

308
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:09,770
Beth... Gold, Silver, or something.

309
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,335
Beth invited us to a mixer
at her synagogue in Lower Merion.

310
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,038
I'm surprised your mother let you go.

311
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,481
Well, it was a fundraiser for charity.

312
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,146
Those poor skinny people in the boats.

313
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,883
This boy danced with me all evening.

314
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,789
David Rosenberg.

315
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,828
He was very good-looking,

316
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,955
but there was something
about him that was gloomy.

317
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,398
Was he a good kisser?

318
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,768
Let's just say he had
more practice than I did.

319
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,466
Yeah, I'm sure he was very disappointed.

320
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,406
Oh, please. The only
reason he picked me

321
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,341
is because I wasn't
part of the synagogue.

322
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,243
In fact, the next day, on the school bus,

323
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,579
Beth told everyone I was necking
with David Rosenberg.

324
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,413
The looks they gave me.

325
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,923
They were all blondes by the next summer.

326
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,101
Honey, it's hot.

327
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,969
And I have to read this book about the desert.

328
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,308
Of course.

329
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,674
Go ahead.

330
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,915
We should get
an air conditioner up here.

331
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,420
We'll see.

332
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,495
Hiya, fellas. Come on in.

333
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,260
Did you see this?

334
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,198
Someone broke into
the Yankees' equipment locker

335
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,292
in Cleveland yesterday.

336
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,304
Swiped Mickey Mantle's pet glove.

337
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,271
Huh. They should have taken his bat.

338
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,400
Shall we wait for you
to have your breakfast?

339
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,537
A day without orange juice
is a hell of a long day.

340
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,274
Hey, look, Ma, no hands.

341
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,912
"Belle Jolie"?

342
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,351
Yeah, I've been looking at the work
of our esteemed predecessors.

343
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,047
I'm not heartened.

344
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,488
They make more colors of lipstick

345
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,388
than Howard Johnson
has ice cream flavors,

346
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,427
but their sales are in the crapper.

347
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,723
These names.

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,457
Passion Flower Peach,

349
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,192
Tropical Boudoir Red.

350
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,029
And look, Ethel Rosenberg Pink.

351
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,104
Wear it to the chair.

352
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,139
Did you know that lipstick was invented

353
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,199
to simulate the flush on a woman's face
after you treated her right?

354
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,041
If you're going to quote
the research report,

355
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,671
don't start with "Did you know?"

356
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,486
Research, I'm stumped.

357
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,056
I'll be honest. I don't speak Moron.

358
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,216
Do either of you speak Moron?

359
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,594
Let's throw it to the chickens.

360
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,998
Okay, girls, come on in.

361
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,162
Come on in, ladies. Gather around.

362
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,503
Settle down.

363
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,010
What, no lunch?

364
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,673
No, dear. This is better.

365
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,249
Belle Jolie wants us to tell them

366
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,841
what we think about their
new line of lipsticks.

367
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,983
One-way glass.

368
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,426
That name seem weird to you?

369
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,293
Should be two-way glass, right?

370
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,128
I don't care what they call it.

371
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,668
Beats the hell out of X-ray Specs.

372
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,695
It's called brainstorming.

373
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,068
That sounds intimidating.

374
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,937
Is it like a test?

375
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,100
There are no wrong answers.

376
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,404
You just be your pretty little selves.

377
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,208
Grab a lipstick,
grab a mirror, and sit down.

378
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,715
Oh, this one's too red for me.

379
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,587
And remember, the mirror
could be your best friend

380
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,092
or your worst enemy.

381
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,959
Has no taste.

382
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,062
Ugly dress.

383
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,638
Horrible wig.

384
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,007
They're brainstorming.

385
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,344
I wouldn't expect more
than a few sprinkles.

386
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,350
I love it when they do that.

387
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,885
My little blowfish.

388
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,657
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?

389
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,023
The red one's for me.

390
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,689
How many lipsticks do you own?

391
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,528
Gee, I don't know.

392
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,499
I'd have to go home and count.

393
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:36,700
Do you match your lip color
to your clothing or to your accessories?

394
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,742
I know. That seems
like a loaded question.

395
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,903
It is unloaded,

396
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,742
and I insist you curb
your editorial comments.

397
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,374
Sometimes I match it to my nail polish.

398
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,181
Good answer. Go ahead.

399
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,619
Do you change your lip color
with the seasons?

400
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,722
You, stand over there.

401
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,403
At what point do we start running electricity
through the chairs?

402
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,999
You should have put a man in there
so they'd take it seriously.

403
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,711
Good.

404
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,475
I was afraid I'd missed it.

405
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,798
I want to stand and salute that.

406
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,114
What's with Mouse Ears over there?

407
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,319
Thanks for coming.

408
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,443
Can I get you anything?

409
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,748
No.

410
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,351
How've you been?

411
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,359
Fine.

412
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,929
Tired.

413
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,559
It doesn't show.

414
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,733
I'm in the middle of spring inventory.

415
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,465
I hope you're not going to tell me

416
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,701
that the grand plan
for remaking our store has a hitch in it.

417
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,572
You look beautiful.

418
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,672
I thought you had
urgent business to discuss.

419
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,241
Anything for the lady?

420
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,582
Nothing for me... Mmm, coffee.

421
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:37,655
Irish coffee?

422
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:38,950
Coffee.

423
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,015
Yes, sir.

424
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,957
Business?

425
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:52,898
It turns out Israel Tourism
is considering becoming a client,

426
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,165
and I'm having a hard time
getting a handle on it.

427
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,366
And I'm the only Jew
you know in New York City?

428
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,340
You're my favorite.

429
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,436
Jesus, Don, crack a book once in a while.

430
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,912
I have.

431
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,711
It's all sentimental World War II trivia,

432
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,514
oranges, kids in blue and white hats.

433
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,612
<i>They're doing a movie of Exodus
with Paul Newman.</i>

434
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,987
Paul Newman? That's nice.

435
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,582
Now I have two reasons to see it.

436
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,791
Damn it.

437
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,094
You're usually so put together.

438
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,436
Thank you.

439
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,510
I'll say one thing about Israelis.

440
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,085
Don't cross them.

441
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,448
Well, those people at the meeting
were definitely Zionists.

442
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,960
Zion just means Israel.

443
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,859
It's a very old name.

444
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,096
I'm sorry. I'm not an expert on this,

445
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,192
and something feels strange
about being treated like one.

446
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,895
I just want to know something about it

447
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,370
that doesn't come from
some ministry of propaganda.

448
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,443
Well, here's some more
World War II trivia.

449
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,068
They just arrested Adolf Eichmann
in Argentina last week.

450
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,305
Have you seen his resume?

451
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,183
Okay, I deserved that.

452
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,845
But I'm talking about
tourists going to Israel.

453
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,889
I don't know what I can say.

454
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,086
I'm American.
I'm really not very Jewish.

455
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,128
If my mother hadn't died having me,

456
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,130
I could have been Marilyn
instead of Rachel.

457
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,597
No one would know the difference.

458
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,928
What is the difference?

459
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,939
Look, Jews have lived
in exile for a long time:

460
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,703
First in Babylon,

461
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,338
then all over the world... Shanghai, Brooklyn...

462
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,612
and we've managed to make a go of it.

463
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,050
Maybe it has something to do

464
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,815
with the fact that we
thrive at doing business

465
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,651
with people who hate us.

466
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,488
I don't hate you.

467
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,192
No. Individuals are wonderful.

468
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,629
That's not what I meant.

469
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,628
I don't know.

470
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,061
A country...

471
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,232
for "those people," as you call us,

472
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,673
well...

473
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,301
it seems very important.

474
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,347
Then why aren't you there?

475
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,417
My life is here.

476
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,509
My grandfather came from Russia,

477
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,679
now we have a store on Fifth Avenue.

478
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,189
I'll visit, but I don't have to live there.

479
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,693
It just... has to be.

480
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,228
For me, it's more
of an idea than a place.

481
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,858
Utopia.

482
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,633
Maybe.

483
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,975
They taught us at Barnard about that word.

484
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,312
Utopia.

485
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,653
The Greeks had two meanings for it:

486
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,017
<i>"Eu-topos,"</i>

487
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,284
meaning "the good place,"

488
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,691
<i>and "ou-topos,"</i>

489
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,526
meaning "the place that cannot be. "

490
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,601
I have to get back to the office.

491
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,538
I better not see this on my bill.

492
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,111
Okay, girls, playtime's over.

493
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,985
Time to put down your lipsticks
and head back to your desks.

494
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,787
Thank you for your cooperation
and your lips.

495
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,385
These go in the closet.

496
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,933
Well, now we have to count
the shades they tried.

497
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,337
Can you bring me those tissues, dear?

498
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,310
Here's your basket of kisses.

499
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,348
Basket of kisses.

500
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,575
That's cute.

501
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,311
Who told you that?

502
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,944
What do you mean?

503
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,522
Where did you hear that?

504
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,352
I just thought of it.

505
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,926
Isn't that what it is?

506
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,094
It is, sweetheart.

507
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,756
Which color did you like?

508
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,391
I didn't get the one I liked.

509
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,163
Someone took my color.

510
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,828
Why didn't you choose another one?

511
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,770
I'm very particular.

512
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,968
As opposed to the other girls?

513
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,272
I don't know.

514
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,713
I don't think anyone wants to be
one of a hundred colors in a box.

515
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,375
I think that's enough complaining.

516
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,612
Why don't you head
back to your desk, Peggy?

517
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:44,427
Bet you wish you could pour
that in a glass and drink it.

518
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,243
Peggy, clear the rest of my afternoon,
would you, please?

519
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,649
<i>You have the Snider's
Catsup people at 3:00.</i>

520
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,553
Have a box of cigars sent over to Jim King
with my apologies.

521
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,488
<i>I'll find out what he smokes.</i>

522
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,082
Good girl.

523
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,655
You got a minute, Chief?

524
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,628
Just.

525
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,892
You don't mind, do you?

526
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,365
Use a glass, Freddie.

527
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,264
Your girl is full of surprises.

528
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,704
Oh, pretty Peggy Sue.

529
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,866
Peggy?

530
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,739
If you say so.

531
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,870
I try to avoid eye contact

532
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,880
to avoid being blinded
by the earnestness.

533
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,881
Actually, she really stood out,
brainstorming-wise.

534
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,545
Brainstorming?

535
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:45,986
Sorry I missed that.

536
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,648
What was the line?

537
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,386
A bucket of kisses.

538
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,688
Basket of kisses.

539
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,693
Bucket sounds better.

540
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,263
If you like 'em wet and sloppy.

541
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,458
The point is,

542
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,501
while the rest of the hens were busy
pulling out each other's feathers,

543
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,594
that one saw the benefit, not the feature.

544
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,070
Really?

545
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,768
Yeah. She said she didn't want to be one
of a hundred colors in a box.

546
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,707
That's interesting, isn't it?

547
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,214
It is.

548
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:16,047
It was like watching a dog play the piano.

549
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,922
<i>It's me, Barbara. Can you talk?</i>

550
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,966
She's still sleeping, thank God.

551
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,160
What's on your mind?

552
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,238
I think I might have met somebody.

553
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,171
You're not sure? That's good.

554
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,301
He has some serious limitations.

555
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,810
<i>Does he work in the store?</i>

556
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,108
No, he doesn't work at the store.

557
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,842
He has a job, doesn't he?

558
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,247
<i>Yes.</i>

559
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,613
Then what's the problem?

560
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,243
Would Daddy like him?

561
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:52,916
Daddy would hate him.

562
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,651
So he's not Jewish.

563
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,522
<i>Who cares what Daddy thinks?</i>

564
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,326
He's not your boyfriend anymore.

565
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,491
Barbara.

566
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,795
<i>You're 28 years old.</i>

567
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,164
<i>You work 60 hours a week.</i>

568
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,602
The last thing you want
is to end up like Aunt Rosie,

569
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,867
lying to your nieces about
how many engagements you had.

570
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,806
Aunt Rosie wasn't lying.

571
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,037
Oh, please, there was
no Max the Communist.

572
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,307
<i>Does he have all his hair?</i>

573
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,746
More than he'll ever need.

574
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,340
<i>Is he funny?</i>

575
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,420
Sometimes. After a couple.

576
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,854
<i>So he's a shikker. Daddy will hate him.</i>

577
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,394
I do feel this attraction.

578
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,689
I want him,

579
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,889
and I want to ignore
everything else about him.

580
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,489
<i>It's 1960. We don't live in a shtetl.</i>

581
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,727
We can marry for love.

582
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,702
I'm not sure people do that anymore.

583
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,296
<i>Why do you always have to be so cynical?</i>

584
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,579
Because sometimes...
things come...

585
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,738
good things...

586
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,475
but there's no future in them.

587
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,880
<i>You're a modern woman, Rach.</i>

588
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,714
<i>Forget the wedding.</i>

589
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,846
Believe me, I'd do anything
for some romance right now.

590
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,791
Peggy.

591
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,391
Hi, Joan.

592
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,936
Mr. Rumsen would like you
to put your industrious little mind

593
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,565
towards coming up with copy
for Belle Jolie Lipsticks.

594
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,543
I don't understand.

595
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,045
They want me to write something?

596
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,910
Whatever you said
in that brainstorming session

597
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,041
apparently knocked their socks off.

598
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,154
Oh, my gosh.

599
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,585
I don't know what to say.

600
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,157
You will, of course,
continue to cover Mr. Draper's desk.

601
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,886
Any writing you do
will be on your own time.

602
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,086
Do I get a raise?

603
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,288
No.

604
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,329
Congratulations.

605
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,423
More work and more responsibility.

606
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,332
I guess you'll be entitled
to some dinner money.

607
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,098
That's swell.

608
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,696
Maybe I should go and thank them?

609
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,409
I'm not really dressed.
Tomorrow, maybe?

610
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,604
No need.
They wanted me to tell you.

611
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,237
They were very specific about it.

612
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:02,179
Well, you know what they say:
The medium is the message.

613
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,728
And here I was just wishing for a man
to help me with my yard work.

614
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,615
Sorry.

615
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,811
That's what I get for being domestic.

616
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
Let's get this off.

617
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,991
Oh, God, hold that.

618
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,392
The thought.

619
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,699
Hi, Roy.

620
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,299
Hi, beautiful.

621
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,607
What's shakin'?

622
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,617
Busy dance card, huh?

623
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,655
Uh, Roy, this is my friend Don Draper.

624
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,987
Don, this is Roy Hazellit.

625
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,081
Pleasure.

626
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,127
Lan's playing down at the Gaslight.

627
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,788
We're gonna go support him,
pass the basket.

628
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,866
You in?

629
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,696
That is if Dad will let you out.

630
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,099
Sounds like fun.

631
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,194
Don, we should go down for a while.

632
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,035
Come on. It'll be a kick.
What do you say?

633
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,006
Afraid you'll miss the 5:31?

634
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,909
I think I'm gonna stay here.

635
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:46,346
I'll wear a skirt and nothing else.

636
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,429
What took you so long?

637
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,194
One of the media buyers
ambushed me in the elevator

638
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,769
with tickets to the ballet, of all things.

639
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,235
I told him I had plans,

640
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,273
but he insisted we share
a cab across town anyways.

641
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,373
I couldn't shake him.

642
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,373
Which one was it?

643
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,536
George Asbury. He's a hound.

644
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,809
It doesn't matter.
They're all just boys.

645
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,907
Poor bastard probably
couldn't help himself,

646
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:18,079
the way you glide around that office
like some magnificent ship.

647
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,158
Well, I don't want to be a distraction.

648
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:26,320
Shall I, um, order horse blinders
for the rest of the office?

649
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,967
You didn't.

650
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,901
Oh, I sure did.

651
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,379
Well, what am I supposed to do with it?

652
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,815
The store lady said you can do anything
but put the cage on the radiator.

653
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,977
You're terrible.

654
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,521
Well, you can't blame a man for trying.

655
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,649
I just hate the thought
of having to share you.

656
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,326
You don't have to share me now.

657
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,895
Joanie, you smell so good.

658
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,497
I've been thinking about this all day.

659
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,603
Mona is looking at a weekend
in Old Saybrook with the in-laws.

660
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,376
There's not enough liquor in the world.

661
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,185
Roger.

662
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,759
Sorry.

663
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,670
"Mary Katharine Cahill,

664
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,107
"a daughter of Harriet M. Barr

665
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,271
"and Archibald W. Barr
of Stonington, Connecticut,

666
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,508
"and Kevin Mark Duncan III,

667
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,607
"a son of Beatrice Hoslinger

668
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,619
"and Kevin Mark Duncan, Jr.,

"were married last evening

at the Episcopal Church
of the Heavenly Rest. "

671
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,058
He travels around the country

672
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,594
and collects miniature
replicas of monuments...

673
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,324
Washington Memorial,
Bunker Hill, Mount Rushmore...

674
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,866
and then he sticks them up his ass.

675
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,868
Symbolism intended.

676
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,734
No place to put your coat.

677
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,870
Switch seats with me.

678
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,172
No way.

679
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,837
Can we get a round over here?

680
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,609
Jack Daniels, Duchess.

681
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,809
Sounds like a great idea.

682
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,284
Anyway, turns out this Spanish cat and I

683
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,049
<i>are mucho simpatico
with the direction we talked about going.</i>

684
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,681
With the "Theater of the People" thing?

685
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,724
Conscious drama.

686
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,851
Not the soulless bullshit

687
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,759
kept alive by the middle class

688
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,492
with their season tickets
to Dick Van Dyke and Mary Martin.

689
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,431
I bet Don here can tell you firsthand.

690
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,298
Broadway is the birthplace
of mediocrity.

691
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,963
"The groom wore a matching boutonniêre
of sweetheart roses. "

692
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,734
Well, maybe it's born there,

693
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,469
but I think it may be conceived right here.

694
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,908
"The couple will
honeymoon in Jamaica,

695
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,446
and take up residence in Rye, New York. "

696
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,083
Thank you, Don.

697
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,661
<i>L'chaim.</i>

698
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,056
So what do you do, Don?

699
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,598
I blow up bridges.

700
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,362
Don's in advertising.

701
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,596
No way.

702
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,070
Madison Avenue? What a gas.

703
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,868
We all have to serve somebody.

704
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,775
Perpetuating the lie.

705
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,210
How do you sleep at night?

706
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,077
On a bed made of money.

707
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,151
Isn't this an education?

708
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:39,916
You hucksters in your tower created
the religion of mass consumption.

709
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:45,326
People want to be told what to do so badly
that they'll listen to anyone.

710
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,896
When you say people,

711
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,090
I have a feeling you're
talking about thou.

712
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,962
And I have a feeling

713
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,231
that you spent more time
on your hair this morning than she did.

714
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,774
You two want to head
to the urinals and poke it out?

715
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,571
So, Roy,

716
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,341
if you had a job...

717
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,040
what would you do?

718
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,119
I'm starting a theater,
right here in the Village.

719
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,550
It's a cooperative.

720
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,316
Midge is going to get in there,
paint some flats.

721
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,585
I said I'd think about it.

722
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,719
Last night I dreamed

723
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:24,392
of making love to Fidel Castro
in a king-size bed

724
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,527
at the Waldorf-Astoria.

725
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:31,506
<i>"¡Viva la revoluciónl" he roared,</i>

726
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,407
as he vanquished my dress.

727
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,376
Outside the window,

728
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,278
Nikita Khrushchev watched us,

729
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,578
plucking a chicken.

730
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,623
Take off your shirt!

731
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,214
Take your shirt off!

732
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,728
I should go.

733
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,301
Too much art for me.

734
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,391
Stay.

735
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,266
This is Ian.

736
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,639
We'll go right afterwards.

737
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,051
By the waters

738
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,685
The waters of Babylon

739
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:28,390
We lay down and wept

740
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,967
And wept

741
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,832
For thee, Zion

742
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,906
We remember thee

743
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,066
Remember thee

744
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,634
Remember thee, Zion

745
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,512
By the waters

746
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:51,520
The waters of Babylon

747
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:55,319
- We lay down and wept
- By the waters

748
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,417
- And wept
- The waters

749
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,429
- For thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

750
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,329
- We remember thee
- By the waters

751
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,698
- Remember thee
- The waters

752
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,261
- Remember thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

753
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,365
- We remember thee
- We lay down and wept

754
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,569
- Remember thee
- And wept

755
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,079
- Remember thee, Zion
- For thee, Zion

756
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,982
- By the waters
- We lay down and wept

757
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,213
- The waters
- And wept

758
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,846
- Of Babylon
- For thee, Zion

759
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:30,688
- We lay down and wept
- By the waters

760
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,887
- And wept
- The waters

761
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,829
- For thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

762
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,868
- We remember thee
- By the waters

763
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,028
- Remember thee
- The waters

764
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:44,665
- Remember thee, Zion
- Of Babylon
