1
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,006
This will look good in your office.

2
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,648
What, take that thing on the train,
like some kid who won at the 4-H?

3
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,055
Besides, no one wants to look
like they care about awards.

4
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,887
But you do.

5
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,122
Isn't that sad?

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,593
Roger was very eloquent.

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,069
He likes to be recognized for selling.

8
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,664
Creative is less important.

9
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,767
Creative helps sell.

10
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,675
But he gave the speech.

11
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,975
Look at you in this tuxedo.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,911
Say it for me.

13
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,490
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Draper.

14
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,115
Enchanted.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,207
Hey.

16
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,069
It's 8:00.

17
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,041
Shit.

18
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,248
Oh, my Lord.

19
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,447
Mommy, Mommy!
Ethel's downstairs.

20
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,220
She's making us breakfast.

21
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,988
Sally, Mommy has a headache.

22
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,360
What's that thing?

23
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,989
Daddy's boss won an award.

24
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,863
Daddy won one, too.

25
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,697
An award for good horses?

26
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,931
Go downstairs and eat something.

27
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,044
I think there's Alka-Seltzer in the kitchen.

28
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,450
Are you okay?

29
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,075
Yeah, just do it in the kitchen.

30
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,245
I don't want to hear the bubbles.

31
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,493
Congratulations, Mr. Draper.

32
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,627
Thank you.

33
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,001
<i>I hear Advertising Age ran a picture.</i>

34
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,971
Fortunately, no one reads that.

35
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,241
That's really amazing.

36
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,213
I'll get Mr. Campbell and Mr. Kinsey.

37
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,842
They wanted you to know
they were waiting, but they left.

38
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,250
That's rude.

39
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,522
They said something about
the Newkie Award going to your head.

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,025
Congratulations, by the way.

41
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,355
Thank you.

42
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,690
Congratulations to you, too.

43
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,855
Thank you, Peggy.

44
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,957
Congratulations for what, being the only one
on time for this meeting?

45
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,094
Oh, I was just telling Peggy
I got a short story published.

46
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,762
Good for you.

47
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,238
<i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

48
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,969
Look at that.

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,408
Congratulations.

50
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,739
Thank you.

51
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,711
What does that have to do with you, Kenny?

52
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,978
"Tapping a Maple
on a Cold Vermont Morning. "

53
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,816
<i>Cosgrove here got a story published
in The, uh... The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

54
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,521
- Heavy.
- You're kidding.

55
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,422
I look forward to reading it.

56
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,788
Keep it. I've got copies.

57
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,853
Congrats, indeed. A thing like that.

58
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,934
You're a writer. You write.

59
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,297
Well, yes.

60
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,634
The weird thing is
short fiction is not my strong suit.

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,866
I have two novels.

62
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,272
Novels? About what?

63
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,210
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

64
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,544
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

65
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,345
The other one is, well,

66
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,112
a woman who's a widow...

67
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,484
she kind of got stuck
with this family farm.

68
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,181
No one will help her except this boy.

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,317
Those don't even sound stupid.

70
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,359
Thanks.

71
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,588
I mean, they both sound good.

72
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,222
- Want to read one?
- I do.

73
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,791
But I also want to talk
about Liberty Capital Savings.

74
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,803
Right.

75
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,136
Talk, one of you.

76
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,109
As you know, Jack Konig says
they want a new promotion.

77
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,678
Interest rates are level.

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,375
Some kind of irresistible fireworks
that bring people to the bank,

79
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,541
even if it's just to visit.

80
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,949
I hate it when they say fireworks.

81
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,578
Especially when they keep
talking about a toaster

82
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,317
with a warming tray on top, or a blender.

83
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,653
A blender's nice.

84
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,853
Jack keeps talking
about escalating the toaster wars

85
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,259
in order to lure women in,

86
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,491
which is silly when you think about it,

87
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,066
because other than a few working girls,

88
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,363
most women aren't
in charge of the banking.

89
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,437
Not in my house.

90
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,527
They visit the bank.

91
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,903
They do.

92
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,709
All we do is try to get the girls in.

93
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,781
Families.

94
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,712
But you know what?

95
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,684
Men need their own accounts,
beyond the family.

96
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,915
Men?

97
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,956
Oh, I can see that.

98
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,686
Discretion. Discretionary.

99
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,955
Statements sent to the office.

100
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,621
Yes.

101
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,190
Liberty Capital Private Account.

102
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,095
No.

103
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,205
Executive Account.

104
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,272
That's why he won an award.

105
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,910
Accounts won the award.

106
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,983
Yeah.

107
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,518
<i>There's a call for you
from Bix Beiderbecke.</i>

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,458
Hello, Mr. Beiderbecke?

109
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,125
It's me, and don't ask who,
or you'll spoil the mood.

110
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,333
Who's Bix?

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,340
The trumpeter.

112
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,138
I was thinking
about playing the horn this afternoon.

113
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,406
Where are you calling me from?

114
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,607
<i>I just had a phone put in.</i>

115
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,118
<i>Really. Instant connection,</i>

116
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,351
<i>just like that night
at the ticket booth in Grand Central.</i>

117
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,017
<i>Midge, I'm at work.</i>

118
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,253
<i>Just get down here.</i>

119
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,796
<i>I want you to pull my hair
and ravish me</i>

120
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,729
<i>and leave me for dead.</i>

121
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,510
I'll be back after lunch.

122
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,652
Kenneth Cosgrove.

123
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,023
I think I'm going to vomit.

124
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,653
Who the hell is Ken Cosgrove?

125
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,788
He's from Burlington, Vermont.

126
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,525
His father is a salesman.

127
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,793
What does that have to do with it?

128
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,993
I can't believe he got published

129
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,797
and didn't tell anyone until it came out.

130
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,067
No, he kept walking around
like the idiot he is.

131
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,542
I have this story
about this crazy night I had

132
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,843
where I ended up in Jersey City
with all these Negroes,

133
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,941
and we all got along.

134
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,782
Can you imagine how good that story is?

135
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,082
No.

136
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,056
It is.

137
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,354
It's a national magazine.

138
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,860
Yep.

139
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,397
That hurts, too.

140
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,307
That was it.

141
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,376
That's what I called for.

142
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,876
You can go.

143
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,309
You can't call me at work.

144
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,218
You scared of me
getting lonely all the time?

145
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,120
Start having conversations with you

146
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,159
and ring you all the time,

147
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,422
saying, "When are you gonna come over?"

148
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,526
This is working right now.

149
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,996
And it worked today.

150
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,273
Look, I'm sorry your life
is in a million pieces.

151
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,348
Be easier for you to have one less.

152
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,750
I hurt your feelings.

153
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,821
You didn't like my call a little bit?

154
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,724
I'm here.

155
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,021
And you waited until you were done

156
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,396
to make me feel bad
about the phone call.

157
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,901
I like that you come in here,
acting like somebody else.

158
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,511
It must be so intense above 14th Street.

159
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,214
Then you shoot down on the train.

160
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,960
That look when I open that door.

161
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,559
Sometimes you're preoccupied,

162
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,531
but then you always...

163
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,467
well, you always...

164
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,470
change gears.

165
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,772
I don't even think about it.

166
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,369
I know.

167
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,013
I like being your medicine.

168
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,213
Okay.

169
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,865
What's wrong with it?

170
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,832
Just tell me. I can tell you don't like it.

171
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,301
Oh, I do.

172
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,204
And I love that you're
sitting alone at your typewriter,

173
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,902
drinking a Scotch, thinking it up.

174
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,672
But you don't like it.

175
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,016
I mostly read the classics.

176
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,712
It seemed strange to me.
It's too modern.

177
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,219
Really?

178
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,122
Uh, that's kind of a compliment.

179
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,060
But I don't think you mean it that way.

180
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,461
I just think it's odd that the bear is talking.

181
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,268
The bear is not talking.

182
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,365
It's what the hunter imagines
the bear to be thinking.

183
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,672
Well, it's well-written.

184
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,773
Why don't you submit it?

185
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,149
I was going to when I
finished dickering with it.

186
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,188
You could run it by Charlie Fiddich.

187
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,555
He has one of those big
publishing jobs, doesn't he?

188
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,458
Your friend Laura kept saying
how he makes things happen there.

189
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,689
Why would I do that?

190
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,163
Because he can help us.

191
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,427
Call him. Ask him to look at the story.

192
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,729
Why now?

193
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,397
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?

194
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,270
He's an account executive, just like me.

195
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,367
Did you know that?

196
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,742
<i>My father reads the damn Atlantic.</i>

197
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,871
So what?

198
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,040
You don't want to be a writer.

199
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,310
I thought it was a hobby.

200
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,649
He's out there.
People know who he is.

201
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,986
Pumpkin, Charlie Fiddich?

202
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,885
I'm surprised.

203
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,926
You can tell what this means to me.

204
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,401
You said you'd do anything for me.

205
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,837
I don't understand you.

206
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,772
You were so upset when I told you.

207
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,275
Told me about what?

208
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,503
Peter.

209
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,477
Told me about what?

210
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,748
That he was my first.

211
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,921
Well...

212
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,160
this helps make up for that.

213
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,594
Let Charlie Fiddich...

214
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,539
see what he's been missing.

215
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,573
Okay.

216
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,983
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

217
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,923
Traffic meeting is starting
in the conference room.

218
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,296
Really.

219
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,422
Cosgrove, I'm serious.

220
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,830
I think it shows tremendous fortitude,

221
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,663
and I'd like to see more of it around here:

222
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,566
People finishing things.

223
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,401
I guarantee you that in the bottom drawer
of every desk in this place

224
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,975
- is the first ten pages of a novel.
- Five.

225
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,806
The story itself was not much to my liking,

226
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,041
but I think it showed
an uncanny understanding

227
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,946
of what most people like.

228
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,313
I guess so.

229
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,216
What did you get paid
for that, a hundred bucks?

230
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,379
About that.

231
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,116
Well, that'll keep you working here.

232
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,488
So, Miss Holloway,

233
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,186
would you like to take the reins?

234
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,526
Let's start with Maytag. Mr. Cosgrove.

235
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,428
Do you want to complain
about the copy,

236
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,127
now that you're a big writer?

237
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,999
Production needs 50% up front,

238
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,401
and we're waiting on a check.

239
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,168
And when will you be calling
the client about that?

240
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,469
Well, I spoke with him last week,

241
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,569
and I'll check with him
again this afternoon.

242
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,942
Aren't you good?

243
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,982
Rio de Janeiro.

244
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,143
<i>The double-page spread
we ran in Life and Town & Country</i>

245
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,242
was so successful,

246
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>they want to resize the ad
to run in Reader's Digest.</i>

247
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,881
Big ad.

248
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,151
Little magazine.

249
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,317
Sal's problem.

250
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,985
Lucky Strike?

251
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,084
Don?

252
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,324
Sales are great. Lawsuit is pending.

253
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,162
You're the one who's
supposed to keep an eye out

254
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,200
on what's happening in Washington.

255
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,701
After the election.

256
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,300
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

257
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,434
I'll take any excuse
to get out of this meeting.

258
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,313
His name is Adam Whitman.

259
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,020
Tell him, uh...

260
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,021
Where is he?

261
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,421
Reception.

262
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,453
I should, uh... I have to deal with this.

263
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,826
Sure, sure.

264
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,365
You better come back, now.

265
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,094
- I got this.
- Okay.

266
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,201
Can I help you?

267
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,147
Can I help you?

268
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,721
It's you.

269
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,357
It's really you.

270
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,120
Dick.

271
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,492
I can't believe it.

272
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,063
I don't know what you're talking about.

273
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
I know I'm grown up, but, Dick, it's me.

274
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,636
It's Adam.

275
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,104
Your little brother?

276
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,839
It's Don.

277
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,311
It says Donald Draper,
but I knew it was you.

278
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,489
Are you upset? Are you mad at me?

279
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,582
I don't even know who you are.

280
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,685
I know I look different.

281
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,594
I grew up tall, okay?

282
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,428
But it's me, Dick.

283
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:13,494
Look, I'm a janitor at American Calculator
in the Empire State Building,

284
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,334
and I found this is someone's trash.

285
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,772
I thought I saw a ghost.

286
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,470
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

287
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,108
You can't even look at me.

288
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,777
Okay. You're at work.

289
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,616
I can come back another time.

290
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,653
No.

291
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,861
There's a coffee shop
three blocks west of here.

292
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,057
Deelite.

293
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,758
I'll meet you there at noon.

294
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,960
That's swell.

295
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,575
And everything's all set
for the Liberty Capital meeting?

296
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,686
Yes, of course, all set.

297
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,728
Well, thank you all.

298
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,593
I'm glad everybody can make it sound
like they're working so hard.

299
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,165
I can't believe this.

300
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,293
It is really you.

301
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,647
What do you want from me?

302
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,581
I don't understand this.

303
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,119
You have nothing to say to me?

304
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,122
Nothing to ask me?

305
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:50,127
Dick, I thought you were dead,
and you're right here.

306
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,562
That's not me.

307
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,528
Can't you even say my name?

308
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,035
Adam...

309
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,009
that's not me.

310
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,543
It is.

311
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,570
What happened to you?

312
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,514
Why did you do that?

313
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,645
Why did you leave me?

314
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,649
I couldn't go back there.

315
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,091
Nothing for me.

316
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,492
I knew you weren't dead.

317
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,902
I knew I saw you that day
hiding in the window in your uniform.

318
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,271
I was only 8, but I knew it was you.

319
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,311
It was a long time ago.

320
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,379
I can't believe...

321
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,879
When I saw that picture in the paper,

322
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:47,577
I thought, "It looks exactly like him,
except around the eyes. "

323
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,280
Donald Draper?

324
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,017
What kind of name is that?

325
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,217
What difference does it make?

326
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,089
People change their names.

327
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,288
Yeah, I guess.

328
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,700
What happened to her?

329
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,201
Mom?

330
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,431
<i>She wasn't my mother.</i>

331
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,769
She never let me forget that.

332
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,706
She's gone.

333
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,939
Stomach cancer.

334
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,709
Good.

335
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,511
Uncle Mack took it pretty hard.

336
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,813
He passed, too.

337
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,618
Are you sure you don't want anything?

338
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,525
I know. I've got this lump in my throat.

339
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,190
I'd love to eat right now, but I can't.

340
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,764
Did you miss me at all?

341
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,742
Of course I did.

342
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,548
It's good to see you.

343
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,119
You look well.

344
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,188
Would have rather had lunch with you.

345
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,223
I know. But I have an appointment

346
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,383
with the decorator
for our new apartment.

347
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,155
Another time, I promise.

348
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,334
You said you enjoyed the story.

349
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,069
Yes, I did.

350
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,839
As much as anyone can
enjoy that kind of thing.

351
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,438
So you like it, or you didn't like it?

352
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,779
It doesn't matter.

353
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,614
It matters that I publish it, right?

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,484
Yes. It does.

355
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,121
Have you been seeing Laura still?

356
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,922
Yes.

357
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,189
She's terrific.

358
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,195
Fun.

359
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,959
She really is.

360
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,377
Trudy, I want to talk to you

361
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,844
about something that has
nothing to do with this.

362
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,507
Okay.

363
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,108
I miss you.

364
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,283
I miss being with you.

365
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,994
That's very sweet to hear.

366
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,553
I know you're married.

367
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,192
It doesn't have to be more
than just being with you.

368
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,239
I can't.

369
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,241
Charlie, I...

370
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,508
No. I can't. I'm a newlywed.

371
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,653
Maybe... like in some movie,

372
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,346
sometime in the future, when we're old.

373
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,514
Maybe then.

374
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,057
I want you now. I don't want you old.

375
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,649
I want you now.

376
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,725
I know you'll never leave him.

377
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,462
I can keep a secret.

378
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,004
No, Charlie.

379
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,940
Please.

380
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,345
Sally, don't run.

381
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,745
Okay!

382
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,078
Hello.

383
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,378
Hello.

384
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,647
My goodness,
you're Mrs. Draper, aren't you?

385
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,620
Hello. You must be Peggy.

386
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,020
I recognized your voice.

387
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,855
So nice to finally meet you in person.

388
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,453
This is Sally and Robert.

389
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,327
We're here for our portrait.

390
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,695
Of course.

391
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,769
I guess I knew that.

392
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,234
Is he in there?

393
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,038
Um, not right now, but please go inside.

394
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,144
I'll be right back.

395
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,074
Joan?

396
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,004
Oh, my God, Joan, I need your help.

397
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,012
Let go of me.

398
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,275
Mrs. Draper is here,

399
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,941
and they're having their portrait taken,

400
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,212
and he snuck out,
and I don't know who to lie to.

401
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,880
Calm down. Just breathe slowly.

402
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,286
Mr. Draper is out,

403
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,655
and I don't think I'm supposed
to know where he went.

404
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,557
- That happens.
- But they're taking their pictures today,

405
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,924
and I would have reminded him,

406
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,622
but he slipped out before I could.

407
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,892
It's his fault. He comes and goes
and never says anything.

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,989
Where is he?

409
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,433
I make an excuse to Mrs. Draper,
she could catch him in it,

410
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,061
especially if she just leaves.

411
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,230
Or even worse, then he'll know

412
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,501
that I know where he was.

413
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,633
Where is he?

414
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,705
I don't know.

415
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,007
You do know,

416
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,548
and you're going to tell me,

417
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,278
or I'm not going to tell you what to do.

418
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,513
- I can't believe you.
- Well?

419
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,285
He sees this woman.

420
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,985
He saw her the other day.

421
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,960
He came back all greasy and calm.

422
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,554
No.

423
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,689
Oh, God. Now I've told you.

424
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
I'm the worst secretary in the world.

425
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,827
- Who is she?
- I don't care. Please hurry.

426
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,600
Peggy, use your noodle.

427
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,144
You're making this so complicated.

428
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,578
You go out there,
and you entertain her and her brats.

429
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,909
Get some Hershey bars from the cart

430
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,577
and tell her you don't know where he is
and you forgot to remind him.

431
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,154
It is the truth. And when he comes back,
let him have an excuse.

432
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,848
He'll have one.

433
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,219
And then you just start apologizing

434
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,088
for, well...

435
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,219
just how stupid you are.

436
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,425
It's probably what I would have done anyway.

437
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,694
Oh, God, now I really shouldn't have told you.

438
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,236
You shouldn't have told me.

439
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,733
I'm not gonna tell anybody,

440
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,241
but you shouldn't have told anybody that.

441
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,718
This isn't how I imagined it.

442
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,052
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,713
You keep saying you're sorry.

444
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,093
Where were you all this time?

445
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,829
Around. Here, mostly.

446
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,631
I'm not mad at you.

447
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,462
I just want to know.

448
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,134
I mean, look at you.

449
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,168
<i>Who is Donald Draper?</i>

450
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,810
I mean, do you have a wife?

451
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,677
Kids?

452
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,251
I'm going to go.

453
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,386
That's it?

454
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,926
Want me to pay for lunch?

455
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,222
- No.
- Let me.

456
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,592
You didn't have anything.

457
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,996
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

458
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,328
When I was little,

459
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,801
I used to imagine this day happening,
and here it is.

460
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,065
I don't understand. I'm family.

461
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,040
I just want to be a part of your life.

462
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,672
Adam, that's not going to happen.

463
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,480
I'm going to walk out that door.

464
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,311
That's it.

465
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,250
I'm not buying your lunch...

466
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,618
because this never happened.

467
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,728
I don't like black licorice, either.

468
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,703
Are you sure we should wait?

469
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,897
I think so.

470
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,635
I can't believe I forgot.

471
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,176
Oh, are you missing your lunch?

472
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,007
No. It's okay. I brought it.

473
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,105
Well, you'll probably
be going out tonight.

474
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,308
Might as well take it easy.

475
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,679
That's true.

476
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,758
Do you have a boyfriend or a steady?

477
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,055
Um, no.

478
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,096
I work a lot.

479
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,721
Some blind dates.

480
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,130
I remember those.

481
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,862
- The disappointments.
- Yeah.

482
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:58,765
Mr. Draper's office.

483
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,208
How's it going?

484
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,846
No, thank you. I'm staying in.

485
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,745
- Mr. Draper treating you well?
- Yes.

486
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,652
He's been very patient

487
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,749
while I've been learning
the ropes around here.

488
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,795
Don't you just hate it
when his mouth runs on and on?

489
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,865
Excuse me?

490
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,957
I'm joking.

491
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,264
You probably know more
about him than I do.

492
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,671
You look so beautiful in that light.

493
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,268
You should take
the picture right there.

494
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,075
Well, I... I did want to look good.

495
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,245
Mr. Draper. I'm...

496
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,617
The portrait.

497
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,024
What happened? Where were you?

498
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,686
We were just about to leave.

499
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,957
I'm so embarrassed.
I forgot to remind you.

500
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,125
No, I forgot to check in
before I went to the printer.

501
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,396
I'm such a fool.
I don't know where my head is.

502
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,664
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.

503
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,501
- Please forgive me.
- No, it's nothing.

504
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,098
All we need are some wet paper towels
to get the chocolate off

505
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,609
before we go in front of the lens.

506
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,076
We'll have to do that on the way.

507
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,771
They must be waiting
for us at the studio.

508
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,473
Come on.

509
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,550
Nice to meet you.

510
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,087
Don't worry about it.

511
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,349
Thank you.

512
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,431
They're terrible.

513
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,523
No, they're not.

514
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,532
Don was late.

515
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,932
It ruins the whole thing.

516
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,833
Oh, Carlton's always late.

517
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,665
You can see what's important to them.

518
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,542
We're very important to them. Stop it.

519
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,615
How'd you like to be
in Helen Bishop's family portrait?

520
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,581
There's a big hole there, believe me.

521
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,182
I want to take them again anyway.

522
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,021
Sally looks fat.

523
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,561
I don't think so.

524
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,688
The worst part is,
Don will think they're fine.

525
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,460
Here. Maybe this one.

526
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,932
Blow that one up.

527
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,128
It'll hold you until the Christmas card.

528
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,671
The color is off on these, too.

529
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,933
Am I wrong?

530
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,603
I really expect the royal treatment
when I go to Don's office,

531
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,704
and I seldom get it.

532
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:23,186
It's like walking into another country
where I don't speak the language.

533
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,654
At Carlton's, I feel like I'm stupid.

534
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,248
All that Manhattan talk.

535
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,329
Our husbands.

536
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,060
They are better out here, aren't they?

537
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,363
Infinitely.

538
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,997
We took your idea of product
and applied it directly to the bank.

539
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,735
Banking products,
not household products.

540
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,971
You said banking products
weren't sexy.

541
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,512
We went down
some really dumb roads,

542
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,673
like bank accounts for children,

543
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,546
and then Don, here,

544
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,381
had this Roman candle of an idea.

545
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,511
Don?

546
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,183
I think Paul has a handle on this.

547
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:13,032
The modern executive is a busy man.

548
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,901
He leads a complicated life.

549
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,771
He has business expenses, family, leisure.

550
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,710
How are you supposed
to keep all that straight?

551
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,749
Well, now Liberty Capital
is going to help you with that.

552
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,977
Okay.

553
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,417
What is this?

554
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,820
An account for a man that is private.

555
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,452
The statements come to the office,
not your home.

556
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,497
I see. For organizing your life.

557
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:41,758
If it needs it.

558
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,265
Liberty for the libertine.

559
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,165
That's good.

560
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,965
Does this say that to you?

561
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,596
It will if you put the word "private" in there
instead of "liberty. "

562
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,767
Executive Private Account.

563
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,604
What are you laughing at?

564
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,047
A portion of our customers
are already, I believe, doing this.

565
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,618
There's just no name for it,

566
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,381
and we had no way to charge them.

567
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,581
I like the torch.

568
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,817
It says, don't get burned.

569
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,757
It could start some uncomfortable
conversations

570
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,728
in a lot of homes, but, uh...

571
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,730
it's better than a calendar.

572
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,697
Let's talk placement.

573
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,894
Hello.

574
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,871
I opened everything but that one.

575
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,398
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig

576
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,340
who has to move to Manhattan
because his wife's mother is sick.

577
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,809
The other is about...

578
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,971
You know, I just finished reading it.

579
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,641
It's really a great story.

580
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,913
Thank you. That means a lot.

581
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,582
It's nice to see
someone's passion be rewarded.

582
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,817
You know what?

583
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,121
I don't have a copy of it,

584
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:23,394
and I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.

585
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,332
Hey!

586
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,735
You said you got, like,
50 more copies, right?

587
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,239
Maybe I do.

588
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,832
If not, it's on every newsstand in town.

589
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,139
Good to hear.

590
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,689
You're leaving?

591
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,762
Yes. For the day.

592
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,592
Oh, okay.

593
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,790
I'm going home.

594
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,231
You can reach me there if necessary.

595
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:05,068
I've always wondered
why he's ignored me.

596
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,666
Probably because he's so good-looking

597
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,973
he can go outside the office
for whatever he wants.

598
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,071
Most of these fellas can't.

599
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,413
He seemed different to me.

600
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,714
Well, either way,
you have to do your job.

601
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,255
Keep his record clean here and at home.

602
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,054
Honestly, if he sees that in you,
you are solid gold.

603
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,152
That's my job?

604
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,457
Yes.

605
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,691
That's his private life.

606
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,768
Private.

607
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,699
That's how these men are.

608
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,499
And it's why we love them.

609
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,731
I don't love him.

610
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,068
Fine.

611
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,609
Look, if you're even thinking
about passing judgment,

612
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,904
then you're in the wrong business.

613
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,242
Okay.

614
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,336
You need to relax.

615
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,814
I have never come over here

616
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,683
and not seen you with a look on your face
that said "I need a drink. "

617
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,618
This job is odd.

618
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,919
But it's the best.

619
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,095
Listen, Kenny.

620
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,425
What?

621
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,396
Listen, I know I've been a bear,

622
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,733
but I've been competing neck and neck
with people in this place.

623
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
I didn't know I was
competing with you, too.

624
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,909
You lost.

625
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,316
Hello, sweetheart.

626
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,290
Hello, dear.

627
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:45,504
Well... I have some good news.

628
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,371
Charlie Fiddich
came by the house this afternoon.

629
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,345
Did he? Here?

630
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,747
I guess your lunch did go well.

631
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,116
It wasn't lunch. I told you that.

632
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,216
So what did he say? Don't tease me.

633
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,350
He said he was going
to get you published.

634
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,452
That is incredibly swell news.

635
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,552
When? Where?

636
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,757
<i>Boys' Life magazine.</i>

637
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,060
What?

638
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,601
It's a $40 fee,

639
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,034
and a lot of people read it.

640
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,834
<i>Are you kidding me? Boys' Life?</i>

641
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,768
<i>That story was good enough
for The New Yorker.</i>

642
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,644
And don't act like those magazines
do everything on merit.

643
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,377
I thought you'd be happy.

644
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,544
For a year's work.

645
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,355
You don't want me to have what I want.

646
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,588
You're going to be published.

647
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,529
<i>Boys' Life.</i>

648
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:46,592
Probably next to some ad for exploding cigars.

649
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,868
<i>I could have gotten you
in The New Yorker</i>

650
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,409
or in the Encyclopedia Britannica

651
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,274
if I wanted to.

652
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,009
So...

653
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,913
why didn't you?

654
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,445
Why would you do that to me?

655
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,218
Why would you put me in that position?

656
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,909
I talked to my father
about the house in Cape May.

657
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,341
He said our dates are good.

658
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,935
August won't be a problem.

659
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,377
That's good.

660
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,311
I wish it wasn't so far from the city.

661
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,477
Then we'd see more of you.

662
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,488
It's not that far.

663
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,617
Well, I hate you
spending August in the office.

664
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,094
Although I liked your girl Peggy.

665
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,164
She's fresh.

666
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,132
As the driven snow.

667
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,533
You sound disappointed.

668
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,129
<i>Did you read some terrible
article in Look magazine</i>

669
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,538
that I should know about?

670
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,201
I like her.

671
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,911
A woman can't just not remark
on her husband's secretary.

672
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,513
Don, are you okay?

673
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,283
No, I just might have
to go back to the office.

674
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,692
I haven't decided yet.

675
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,822
Phone!

676
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,893
Hello.

677
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,596
I need to see you tonight. Are you busy?

678
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,163
For you? Of course not.

679
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,607
Good. I'm leaving now.

680
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,475
<i>From where?</i>

681
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,605
25 minutes.

682
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,275
I don't even know what you drink.

683
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,115
Whatever you have.

684
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,052
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

685
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,485
Come in.

686
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,023
Sit down.

687
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,126
I know it's terrible.

688
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:09,165
It's temporary, I... I hope.

689
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,031
Look at you.

690
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,131
You look more like you now.

691
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,313
I came here because
I wanted to talk to you

692
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,942
and explain something to you.

693
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,317
You got to stop that kind of talk.

694
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,390
This isn't so hard.

695
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,860
Adam, listen to me.

696
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,390
I have a life,

697
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,728
and it only goes in one direction:

698
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,824
Forward.

699
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,033
What are you drinking?

700
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,299
Gin?

701
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,638
I found it in one
of the offices, under a couch.

702
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,336
Three quarts.

703
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,175
I figured I could take one.

704
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,441
Coffee.

705
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,744
I can do that.

706
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,413
So no Abigail, no Uncle Mack.

707
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,753
Nobody, huh?

708
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,694
I know. It's strange.

709
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,425
Your office is really nice.

710
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,368
I figure from that award
you must be pretty important.

711
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,204
I don't know. I guess so.

712
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,507
Well, everyone always said
you were too smart for your own good.

713
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,379
Of course, Uncle Mack
thought you were soft.

714
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,679
But you're not, are you?

715
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,050
No, I'm not.

716
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,789
What are you doing?

717
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,292
That's $5,000.

718
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,698
That's all there is.

719
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:58,969
I want you to take it,
and I want you to leave New York,

720
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,978
and I don't want to see
or hear from you ever again.

721
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,283
That's not what I wanted.

722
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,412
That's not right.

723
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,253
That's all I can do for you.

724
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,960
You're serious, aren't you?

725
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,358
You thought I was dead.

726
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,800
Just go back to thinking that.

727
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,270
Where do I go?

728
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:37,743
Adam, it is $5,000.

729
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,952
Make your own life.

730
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,622
I have too much here.

731
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,721
It's going to be okay.

732
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,062
How'd it go?

733
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,638
Crisis averted?

734
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,708
Yes. Papers were on my desk.

735
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,379
Do you want to go visit the kids?

736
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,383
No, I just want to go to sleep.

737
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,457
I want to talk to you about something,

738
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,529
and I don't want you to get upset.

739
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,330
I won't.

740
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,739
I know you hate going to my family's
house in Cape May,

741
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,437
and I know even though my father...

742
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:53,277
No, it's great. It's great.

743
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,613
I'm looking forward to it already, I swear.

744
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,122
But I know you don't like
that my father might be there for part of it.

745
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,625
I just don't like
the way he looks at me.

746
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,753
You took away his little girl.

747
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:14,598
I was thinking maybe we should
just buy a summer house.

748
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:19,005
Something closer that's ours.

749
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,545
I know we had a good year.

750
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,673
I don't know, Bets.

751
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,722
I think Cape May will be fine.

752
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,991
We're not that flush right now.

753
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,154
There's nothing to be worried about.

754
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,564
I'd just rather wait till next year.

755
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,330
Good.

756
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,303
Because I like seeing my dad.
