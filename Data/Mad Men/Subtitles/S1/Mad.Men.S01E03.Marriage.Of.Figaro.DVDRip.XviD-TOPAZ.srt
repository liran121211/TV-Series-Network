1
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,071
Hey. Dick?

2
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,376
Richard Whitman?

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,653
Holy smokes, is that you?

4
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,756
As I live and breathe.

5
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:58,915
It's me. Larry.

6
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,760
Krisinski, L. Fort Sill?

7
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,593
Oh, of course. Larry, look at you.

8
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,428
Yeah, and you.

9
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,332
Still haven't filled out.
You must be a bachelor.

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,803
No.

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,965
Where are you at?
I'm out of Waltham, Mass.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,806
I'm just spending a day in Armonk
with International Business Machines.

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,936
I'm upstate.

14
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,877
Hey, I just saw Jerry Creighton.

15
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,812
Remember? Slept with a sidearm in his bunk.

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,646
Almost blew his jaw off?

17
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,346
Yeah, I remember that.

18
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,821
Yeah, well... Look, I should, uh...

19
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,824
Call me. We should catch up.

20
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,519
Absolutely.

21
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,856
Old Dick Whitman.

22
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,329
What are the chances?

23
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,417
Good morning, Hollis.

24
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,758
I mean, it's France.
What do they want with the bomb?

25
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,161
We must have given it to them.

26
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,199
No way the frogs
came up with it on their own.

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,927
- Hey, it's the honeymoon kid.
- Hey.

28
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,526
Here comes Romeo
without his roe, like a dried herring.

29
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,730
Do I seem different?

30
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,431
You do look depleted, Humps.

31
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,439
The wedding was great.

32
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,804
How was the rest of it?

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,434
You're talking about my wife here.

34
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,479
Oh, she's already got you there?

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,638
Gentlemen never discuss this.

36
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,409
We're talking about you here:

37
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,077
The man who told us
the coat check girl from "21"

38
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,518
had tangerine panties.

39
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,647
Come on, buddy boy, spill.

40
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,748
I don't know.

41
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,123
Something happened in the ceremony.

42
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,789
It's when he said that thing
about being new baptized.

43
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,493
I just felt this calm come over me.

44
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,263
So what you're saying is,
uh, a lot of missionary?

45
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,741
Fine.

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,370
So she's laying there, right?

47
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,039
And she kept looking at the maps,

48
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,482
talking about all the things
we were going to do...

49
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,213
but we never did.

50
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,221
<i>Ladies Home Journal.
I can get that at Mom's.</i>

51
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,551
Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.

52
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,592
Well, hey, there.

53
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,888
The ring, it's like catnip.

54
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,125
Did you know that 600,000 gallons of water
go over the Falls per second?

55
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,200
Per second!

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,928
Oh, look. He's back.

57
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,401
Good morning.

58
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,938
- Congratulations.
- Welcome back.

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,632
Thanks, everybody.

60
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,140
When did this place get so friendly?

61
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,335
I guess people missed you.

62
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,275
- Welcome back, Mr. Campbell.
- Hildy.

63
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,043
Close the door!

64
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,052
Close the door!

65
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,385
Who put the Chinamen in my office?

66
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,857
Welcome back.

67
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,127
They paid an Oriental family
to be in Mr. Campbell's office.

68
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,173
Someone will finally
be working in there.

69
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,612
Mr. Romano, Mr. Kinsey, and Mr. Crane
are here for your meeting.

70
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,553
Do you need a minute?

71
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,146
Do you need a minute? You must.

72
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,783
You keep moving the Secor laxative
discussion.

73
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,131
See what we did to Campbell's office?

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,931
What do we have?

75
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,137
Let me remind you, safe and reliable
would make me doze off

76
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,572
if I wasn't so blighted
by the scourge of constipation.

77
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,474
Well, what can I say? I'm blocked.

78
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,945
I told you he wouldn't
think that was funny.

79
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,310
I got one.

80
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,214
How 'bout "Secor. It's satisfeculant"?

81
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,150
Stay in the art department, Sal.

82
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:52,122
I'm just saying we can be funny,
like those Volkswagen people.

83
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,453
You see this yet?

84
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,617
I have.

85
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,661
I don't know what I hate about it the most,

86
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,889
the ad or the car.

87
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,362
You know, they did one last year.

88
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,160
Same kind of smirk.
Remember "Think small"?

89
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,292
It was a half-page ad in a full-page buy.

90
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,665
You could barely see the product.

91
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,829
I don't get it.

92
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,462
Elvis just got back from West Germany.

93
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,370
Why not put him in it?

94
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,737
They must be getting results.

95
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,277
They keep going back to the well.

96
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,438
I want the Chinamen
out of the building by lunch.

97
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,981
I'm still waiting on my shirts.

98
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,878
You've seen this?

99
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,227
- I'm back now.
- I see that.

100
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,563
So...

101
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,731
I should be on the list for the meeting.

102
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,638
Oh, I just...

103
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,472
I didn't know when
you were coming back.

104
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,670
Right.

105
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,776
Yeah, well, it's today. Here I am.

106
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,582
They're all in there already. You can go in.

107
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,081
Peggy...

108
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,494
When I came over that night,

109
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,829
you know, before.

110
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,061
I was there.

111
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,570
You know...

112
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,265
I'm married now.

113
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,434
I know.

114
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,942
So...

115
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,880
Pete...

116
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,215
I understand.

117
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,481
It never happened.

118
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,755
You want me to buzz you in?

119
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,454
The door looks a little bit open.

120
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,533
Sorry about that.
I took the Chinese out of the building.

121
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,196
But I have a feeling in an hour

122
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,864
I'm gonna want
to take them out again.

123
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,804
Bernbach. He's a Jew.

124
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,213
If I were him, I wouldn't want
to help reindustrialize Germany.

125
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,716
Everybody's got a price.

126
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,184
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

127
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,811
Honesty. It's a great angle.

128
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,823
No chrome, no horsepower,

129
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,018
foreign, ugly.

130
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,355
Guess they went with their strengths.

131
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,589
- It is funny.
- It is?

132
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,891
'Cause I think the joke's on us.

133
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,025
You're supposed to look at that
and say it's a great car, not a great ad.

134
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,568
I laughed. I think it's brilliant.

135
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,001
Brilliant.

136
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,404
I'll tell you what brilliance
in advertising is: 99 cents.

137
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,668
Somebody thought of that, Campbell.

138
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,074
Well, say what you want. Love it or hate it,

139
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,580
the fact remains we've been talking
about this for the last 15 minutes.

140
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,141
<i>And this is Playboy.</i>

141
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,913
Of course, what we should have
been talking about is Secor laxative,

142
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,357
unless, as it appears,
there is nothing to say.

143
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,759
I don't want to hear this.

144
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,296
We're on the case.

145
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,595
Part of this job is doing things
you don't want to do.

146
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,827
Most of it.

147
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,975
It's good to be back, Draper.
I missed you.

148
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,340
Then it must not have been
much of a honeymoon.

149
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,776
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

150
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,977
How's married life?

151
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,576
It's pretty swell.

152
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,392
I was raised that men don't wear jewelry.

153
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,327
I kind of like it.

154
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,022
Trudy's a lot funnier than I thought.

155
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,463
I'm actually looking forward
to going home tonight.

156
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,626
Well, I look forward to meeting her.

157
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,769
Hey, maybe one of these nights

158
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,637
we could get dinner together
with the, uh, wives.

159
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,868
Maybe we can.

160
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,661
You know, girls, we'd be happy
to bring you coffee.

161
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,253
I was on my way over anyways.

162
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,560
I have something of yours.

163
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,229
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.
I finished it last night.</i>

164
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,703
Good to the last drop, right?

165
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,831
Well, I can see why it got banned.

166
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,842
Well, you don't have to be so shy about it.

167
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,241
It's literature.

168
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,710
That is a huge pocketbook, Joan.

169
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,010
Well, it's got a change of clothing
and a toothbrush in it.

170
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,584
A hope chest.

171
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,585
Have you read this, Peggy?

172
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,747
I don't think that's a good idea.

173
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,658
There's, um... this word in it a lot.

174
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,990
I know the word, Joan.

175
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,529
Well, it's sad, really,

176
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,997
because even with its reputation,
men won't read it.

177
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,431
And they really should.

178
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,025
I don't care if it's 500 years old.

179
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,038
It's another testimony to how
most people think marriage is a joke.

180
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,835
They rip a lot of clothing.

181
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,273
Yeah, it's a fantasy.

182
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,606
He's married, and she's married.

183
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,976
The desperate passion
of the forbidden.

184
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,605
Can I borrow it?

185
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,741
She's making it sound better than it is.

186
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,478
There's a few good parts, that's all.

187
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,851
And the book just opens
to those pages by itself.

188
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,689
Hey, don't read it on the train.

189
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,226
It'll attract the wrong element.

190
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,553
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,797
So the doctor says to him,
"I hope you're happy.

192
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,462
"While you were out
finishing a round of golf,

193
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,233
"your wife was in a horrible accident.

194
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,172
"She is gonna need 'round-the-clock care.

195
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,107
Bathing, toilet. "

196
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,940
Then the doc looks at him and says,

197
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,070
"I'm just kidding. She's dead.

198
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,443
Hey, what'd you shoot?"

199
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,176
...initial research report

200
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,219
and what I think are some very astute
market observations.

201
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,518
Mr. Draper.

202
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,389
Pleased to see you didn't disappear
the minute you cashed my check.

203
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,621
We appreciate your business.

204
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,129
Kenny, of course, you know.

205
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,426
Harry Crane, media.

206
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,366
And Mr. George Pelham over here,
who is from research,

207
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,529
and who has more degrees
than a Russian protractor.

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,266
That's quite an introduction.

209
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,433
From the other side of the pond, I see.

210
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,203
We take his word for it.

211
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,015
So, uh, that is yours to keep.

212
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,349
But if you'd like to follow along,
you'll see from the overview

213
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,823
our primary focus was Saks,
Henri Bendel, and Bonwit Teller.

214
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,689
Our research uncovered
a variety of options

215
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,231
they utilize to attract
your desired customers.

216
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,632
One thing these stores have in common
is a comfortable shopping environment.

217
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,034
Spacious, open sales floors,

218
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,903
An almost conspicuous lack of clutter.

219
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,373
Merchandise is minimal

220
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,879
and neatly presented on tables
and in display cases.

221
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:27,044
This "less is more" philosophy
is also evident in the window displays.

222
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:31,055
For example,
only one sweater to a window,

223
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,490
as opposed to windows
stuffed with merchandise.

224
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,424
My father's going to love that.

225
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,929
Believe it or not,
it even applies to the mannequins.

226
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,760
Bendel's takes the heads off theirs

227
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,130
so the shopper can imagine them
to be anyone.

228
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,725
Anyone without a head.

229
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,702
Along with these cosmetic changes,

230
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,368
you'll also need to provide
what we call boutique extras.

231
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,671
A personal shopping service,

232
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,177
private fashion shows,

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,713
and designer collections.

234
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,578
This is comprehensive.

235
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,514
It's the lay of the land.

236
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:03,179
Just from holding it, I feel more informed
about my competitors than ever.

237
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,590
And yet my store already has
a personal shopping service

238
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,026
and designer collections,

239
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,530
which makes me wonder
if you were so focused on my competitors

240
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,725
that you failed to visit my store.

241
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,301
I've been away on my honeymoon.

242
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,804
I've been there a few times.

243
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,898
It's a beautiful old place.

244
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,205
Miss Menken, I can assure you

245
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,719
that no one at this table
has ever been to your store.

246
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,983
A wrong I will personally correct
this afternoon.

247
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,391
It's right on 5th Avenue.

248
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,432
That's one big block over
and a dozen little blocks up.

249
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,834
It's been there for 30 years.

250
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,563
- I'll walk you out.
- I've got it.

251
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,509
Harry.

252
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,874
What?

253
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,008
It was nice
the way you handled that.

254
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,051
It's hard to get caught in a lie.

255
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,643
Well, it wasn't a lie.

256
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,018
It was ineptitude
with insufficient cover.

257
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,785
Something about the way
you talk always restores my confidence.

258
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,658
I have a deep voice.

259
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,424
This afternoon, then.

260
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,363
It's a date.

261
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,235
New junior exec.

262
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,604
Changing her store
could take six months...

263
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,047
or a year, if I know what's good for me.

264
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,948
- What was that in there?
- What?

265
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,248
Don and Molly Goldberg.
Did you see that?

266
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,845
Yeah, I caught it. What's your point?

267
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,822
I don't know. I mean,
everybody always jokes about it,

268
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,190
but I've never seen Draper
really turn that switch on before.

269
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,593
I guess he likes her. What would you do?

270
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,359
Trying to quit.

271
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,496
You are really putting the junior
in junior executive.

272
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,905
Look, you're married now, all right?

273
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,274
I'm a part of that club, too.
Two very happy years.

274
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,847
But when I'm out in the world...

275
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,814
I don't know. I don't do it much.

276
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,043
I'm not good at it...

277
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,915
The flirting, the double entendres...

278
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,715
You mean something on the side?

279
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:21,122
No. I mean enjoying
the company of women

280
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,161
in the limited way a married man can.

281
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,361
It's all we have, really.

282
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,729
I can't speak for everyone,
but it's plenty for me.

283
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,802
Same. I guess on some level,

284
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,734
I always thought Draper
was the same way.

285
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,271
Draper?

286
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,533
Who knows anything about that guy.

287
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,199
No one's ever lifted that rock.

288
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,039
He could be Batman for all we know.

289
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,308
Mr. Campbell,
you wife's on the phone.

290
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,349
There's bird shit on the couch.

291
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,850
That was priceless.

292
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,851
Hello, honey.

293
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,820
Dinner? Wow.

294
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,188
What do I want for dinner?

295
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't know.

296
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,755
Anything but chicken.

297
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,990
Yes, they missed me.

298
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,626
Uh, rib eye in the pan with butter.

299
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,636
Ice cream.

300
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,296
I love you, too.

301
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,271
There's going to be dinner
waiting for me when I get home.

302
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,244
Yeah. How about that?

303
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,904
Mr. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish
in our housewares section.

304
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,842
Why do I hire young girls?

305
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,381
Because they cost practically nothing.

306
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,313
Costume change.

307
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,908
This is my closet.

308
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,718
The original tenants laid the last brick
the day before the crash.

309
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,691
Boy, were they in for a surprise.

310
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,056
As I hope you know by now,
our original store was just off 7th Avenue.

311
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,635
It was just hosiery.

312
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,000
Then they started pulling piecework
from sweatshops.

313
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,370
By 1932, these people had failed.

314
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,808
My father and uncle
picked this place up for a shekel.

315
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,312
Well, it is crowded.

316
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,678
But that might have
something to do with the sale,

317
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,149
which means that, if we're successful,

318
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,776
you're gonna lose
the customers you have

319
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,650
in order to get
the customers you want.

320
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,621
I was gonna start with raising prices.

321
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,590
Can you imagine what my father said?

322
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,456
Well, you do have
to give them something

323
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,927
for their higher dollar count.

324
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,989
It's just awfully hard to define what that is.

325
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,836
How may I help you?

326
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,603
I make them say that.

327
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,178
Carol, can we see this tray right here?

328
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,216
Sea horses,

329
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,449
crowns,

330
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,785
lucky dice.

331
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,054
Medieval knights.

332
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,640
That's better.

333
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,833
Thank you.

334
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,981
Let's take a look at the second floor.

335
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,092
We're known for our service.

336
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,754
That's gotta be a tough job.

337
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,991
I know.

338
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,933
I've always liked how quiet it is up here.

339
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,732
Well, that might explain the lack of customers.

340
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,604
I can see the charm, but...

341
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,645
the room is too dark, too old-fashioned.

342
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,078
The products look old.

343
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,444
But the people look wonderful.

344
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,876
It's a shame we're gonna
have to lop their heads off.

345
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,251
It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.

346
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,483
It's not my favorite part, actually.

347
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,272
The grand lot of us are going to Lansky's.

348
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,003
Can you believe it?

349
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,512
Have a swell time. I've got plans.

350
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,478
You look nice.

351
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,392
Hell.

352
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,231
Manhattan at your feet.
I can see the appeal.

353
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,827
The view's okay.

354
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,635
Now, this is my favorite part of the store.

355
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,537
Hey there, Missy.

356
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,644
Hey.

357
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,648
I haven't seen you in a while.

358
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,310
- Hey.
- How did they get the penthouse?

359
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,046
They patrol.

360
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,713
It's the only way to make sure

361
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,723
there isn't anyone hiding
in the store at night.

362
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,486
Well, they know I'm with you, right?

363
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,721
These two are Carla and Leona.

364
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,266
Not the originals, but third generation,

365
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,767
and what every generation
of Menken dog

366
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,033
shall be named until the end of time.

367
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,971
I made my father's
legal counsel add that

368
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,043
to the store's by-laws when I was 9.

369
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,510
So even then you enjoyed
telling men what to do.

370
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,071
To be fair, the store
was practically home.

371
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,379
My father liked to work.

372
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,784
I used to come out here
and talk to them...

373
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,014
well, the originals...

374
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,852
every night.

375
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,826
For a little girl,
a dog can be all you need.

376
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,955
They protect you. They listen.

377
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,465
I had my sister, but there weren't other kids.

378
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,060
And, of course,
my mother wasn't around.

379
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,765
Well, that's not always a bad thing.

380
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,035
Who knows?

381
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,043
She died when she was having me.

382
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,449
Anyway, my sister
became my only company.

383
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,915
And frankly,

384
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,986
these bitches were easier to handle.

385
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,990
What is this?

386
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,532
Don't try to convince me
that you were ever unloved.

387
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,392
I don't know what to say.

388
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,637
Listen...

389
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,574
I'm married.

390
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,323
I guess I didn't ask
'cause I didn't want to know.

391
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,463
That shouldn't have happened.

392
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,769
Well, you couldn't help yourself.

393
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,964
I knew what I wanted...

394
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,007
from the first time
you stormed out of our office.

395
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,133
You stormed out of your office.

396
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,914
I took you up here. That was stupid.

397
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,708
I just so looked forward
to seeing you again.

398
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,551
Now I guess that's over.

399
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,897
I know you understand

400
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,268
I'd rather not have to
explain this to anyone.

401
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,362
The account stays.

402
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,442
I just want someone else on it.

403
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,303
Don't look at me like that.

404
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,540
What do you do,
just kiss women all the time?

405
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,709
Women you aren't married to?

406
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,753
Of course not.

407
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,255
Well, then, am I supposed to live
some life running alongside yours?

408
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,157
I have some checks to sign.

409
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,809
Excuse me.

410
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,644
You dropped your paper.

411
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,144
Thank you.

412
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,349
Daddy!

413
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,983
Daddy! Daddy!

414
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,061
Wake up. It's my birthday.

415
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,595
It's my birthday!

416
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,062
It's my birthday!

417
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,895
It's not your birthday. It's your party.

418
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,229
Don, the party's at 2:00.

419
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,794
You have to put together
the P-L-A-Y-H-O-U-S-E.

420
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,065
How am I going to put together a pony?

421
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,111
A pony? I'm getting a pony?

422
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,306
Bobby, I'm getting a pony!

423
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,577
Great.

424
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,149
She'll forget all about it
when she sees the playhouse.

425
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,354
There's a bacon and egg sandwich
for you on the range.

426
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,513
It's got a red door like ours!

427
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,137
Daddy!

428
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,682
You are not supposed to see this yet.

429
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,446
Why don't you run to the garage
and get me another beer?

430
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,613
Okay.

431
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,587
Capers?

432
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,460
You want to pick those out of the rug?

433
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,295
Well, they look naked.

434
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,269
Well, the only thing
this one wants is raw hamburger.

435
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,771
What does that mean?

436
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,239
I think that's enough of that.

437
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,673
Well, how many are we?

438
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,335
Us, you...

439
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,935
Carlton's with the kids. Make it quick.

440
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,140
The Darlings, Helen Bishop...

441
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,581
- You didn't.
- I had to.

442
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,277
She saw me buying balloons at the market.

443
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,910
- Didn't seem right.
- So what?

444
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,990
I just brought her the pie,
got my dish back at the end.

445
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,491
Have you seen her walking
up Downtree Ridge?

446
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,755
Where the hell is she walking to?

447
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,024
I don't know.

448
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,292
How old is her kid?

449
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,561
Kids.

450
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,795
The boy is 9.

451
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,804
I'm gonna say Gary, maybe Glen?

452
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,373
And the baby is a 2-year-old.

453
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,499
She said she was gonna
try and get a sitter.

454
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,601
I would.

455
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,703
It's probably a big event for her.

456
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,279
That man.

457
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,588
I know.

458
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,073
You didn't use the powder room, did you?

459
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,047
It will appear untouched.

460
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,410
Everyone's gonna be here soon.

461
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,488
Why don't you go up
and take a shower?

462
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,146
Want company?

463
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,692
Mint juleps. It's that time of year.

464
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,636
- Wonderful.
- I'm so thirsty lately.

465
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,234
Ready or not, here I come!

466
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,869
There's date nut bread,
cold turkey,

467
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,039
and Waldorf salad for the adults.

468
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,112
And I just made
peanut butter sandwiches for the kids.

469
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,951
I know everybody eats that.

470
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,718
Thank you.

471
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,725
And in case anybody's going to ask,

472
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,192
I did not get that clown.

473
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,660
- Oh.
- Oh.

474
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,698
He got booked in some off-Broadway show.

475
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,767
About clowns? I think we saw that.

476
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,031
It's not the one
where they take their clothes off, is it?

477
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,127
Who knew that could be boring?

478
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,266
Want something a little
stronger there, Carlton?

479
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,434
He'll manage.

480
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,034
We were thinking about you, Don.

481
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,104
We saw this thing on TV.

482
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,547
It was right in the middle
of the news. It was cute.

483
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,845
The guy flying with his hat on.

484
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,147
- Did you do that one?
- It was so cute.

485
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,383
- I think the man looks exactly like Henry.
- Except not as handsome.

486
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,050
I haven't seen that.

487
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,459
I'm going to go and leave
the kids' food out.

488
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,861
Let's not even bother
trying to get them to sit.

489
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,159
I'll co-pilot.

490
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,859
Heard a good one the other day.

491
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,866
No, Chet.

492
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,266
I'm gonna tell the joke.

493
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,669
Your wife and your lawyer
are drowning.

494
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,104
You have a choice to make:

495
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,676
You go to lunch or a movie?

496
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,074
It's good, right?

497
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,510
Hey, I'm missing the ball game.

498
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,171
I might as well have some fun.

499
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,806
Hey.

500
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,885
So how are things on Mad Ave, Don?

501
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,112
Looks like they're taking care of you.

502
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,883
We got it all, huh?

503
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,787
Yep, this is it.

504
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,829
Maybe it's his obsession with sports,
but it's been hard for Jack.

505
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,868
Marilyn, I've been watching Kevin,
and he gets around very well.

506
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,162
I bet he doesn't know the difference.

507
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,501
He does.

508
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,599
He's very determined.

509
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,736
Jack really gets angry anytime someone
mentions the vaccine,

510
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,781
and I tell him we should be grateful.

511
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,941
First of all, it could
have been much worse.

512
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,609
It could have gotten to his lungs.

513
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,347
Second of all, this can't happen
to other children.

514
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,252
They think they're athletes.

515
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,756
I want to say to Chet,

516
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,020
"I saw you play football in high school.

517
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,187
Your son's going to
be a tackling dummy just like you. "

518
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,966
According to Glen here,

519
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,273
when the door's a little bit open,
you're supposed to come in.

520
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,279
Hello, Helen.

521
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,110
I hate to start with a bunch of excuses,
but the babysitter was late,

522
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,051
and I still haven't
unpacked all the boxes,

523
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,385
so this was the only paper I could find.

524
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,756
It should be Christmas all year
as far as I'm concerned.

525
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,258
<i>Ajury in New York City</i>

526
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,769
<i>is expected to receive
the tax evasion paper...</i>

527
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:52,198
<i>...Opera's production
of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro,</i>

528
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,541
<i>with Robert Merrill and Joan Sutherland.</i>

529
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,047
Don, you have to pick up the cake
from Hightop.

530
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,516
Oh, and this is Helen Bishop and Glen.

531
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,779
Nice to meet you all.

532
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,422
Don. He goes with me.

533
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,493
Then Carlton, Chet, and Jack.

534
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,618
Glen, I'm pretty sure there are

535
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,127
some peanut butter
sandwiches and a BB gun

536
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,162
out there in the backyard.

537
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,663
Why don't you come with me?

538
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,564
Don, can I speak with you?

539
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,734
Let's see, I told you about the cake,

540
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,812
and... oh, can you take
some movies this time?

541
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,438
Of everyone or just Chief Tiny Tim?

542
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,677
You bought that camera,
and you always forget.

543
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,253
Okay.

544
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,788
Ladies, ladies, this is Helen Bishop.

545
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,693
- This is Marilyn.
- Nice to meet you.

546
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,787
And Nancy.

547
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,026
She seems scared, poor thing.

548
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,093
Trust me, those hens are
gonna peck her to death.

549
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,901
Do you see her running around
in that little Volkswagen?

550
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,305
That's kind of desperate.

551
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,468
That won't help her.
It's got no back seat.

552
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,307
She'll have to find some midget hitchhiker.

553
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,946
Last time I saw one of those,
I think I was throwing a grenade into it.

554
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:08,950
Yeah.

555
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,544
The problem with Easter break
is it's too long.

556
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,884
The doldrums.

557
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,824
We're thinking about seven days,
six nights, in Boca Raton,

558
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,020
with mosquitoes as big as a silver dollar.

559
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,394
And believe me, those aren't the only
giant noses you'll have to deal with.

560
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,262
Francine.

561
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,199
Carlton and I went
there on our honeymoon,

562
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,362
and all I can say
is we were outnumbered.

563
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,370
It's uncomfortable.

564
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,906
You want to be able to relax.

565
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,976
We went to Bermuda
on our honeymoon.

566
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,134
Pink sand beaches.

567
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,337
Where did you go?

568
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,277
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

569
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,952
It's okay. I went to Paris.

570
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,819
Four years of Mount Holyoke French.

571
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,414
Haven't used it since.

572
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,759
And I wouldn't give it back,
even being with Glen's father.

573
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,766
Is that your ex-husband?

574
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,526
Yes.

575
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,769
I went to Italy.

576
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,136
Not on my honeymoon,

577
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,972
but right after I graduated from Bryn Mawr.

578
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,272
What a summer.

579
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,505
<i>Three Coins in the Fountain.</i>

580
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,945
It was right about that time.

581
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,778
You must have loved Paris.

582
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,283
It's all walking.

583
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,012
What do you mean?

584
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,214
Just that I've seen you
walking around the neighborhood.

585
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,952
I've seen you, too, when I was driving.
I think I waved.

586
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,926
Where are you going
when you do that?

587
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,930
No place. I just like to walk.

588
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,559
But where?

589
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,501
Anywhere.

590
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,233
It just relaxes me and clears my mind.

591
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,468
I heard on the radio that Einstein did it.

592
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,137
Einstein? He's got
his hands into everything.

593
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,886
Sweetie.

594
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,052
Hi, Daddy!

595
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,700
What are you, Frank Sinatra?

596
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,608
I was looking for Glen.

597
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,614
Bunch of them just ran through.

598
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,054
There are the boys.

599
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,884
How are we doing?

600
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,324
It's, uh, it's Helen, right?

601
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,792
I know your situation,

602
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,199
and my heart breaks for that little boy.

603
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,032
I have a baby, too.

604
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,233
You can act strong,

605
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,400
but I just want to volunteer.

606
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,602
If you ever need someone

607
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,770
to throw the ball
around with him some Sunday,

608
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,745
take him to the beach.

609
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,975
That would be nice.

610
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,478
I'm sure eventually I'd get so used
to your Sunday visits,

611
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,557
I'd join you at the beach,
just the four of us.

612
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,627
Then one night, you'd
drop us off at the house

613
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,424
and walk me in with an umbrella.

614
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,862
The kids would go to sleep,

615
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,796
and we'd laugh
about all the funny things

616
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,596
that happened at the beach that day.

617
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,863
I don't want you telling Francine

618
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,565
that I suggested
something that I didn't.

619
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,837
Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

620
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,087
You dented the car.

621
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,988
I like sleeping on the couch.

622
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,720
I don't like your tone.

623
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,023
Take your shoes off.

624
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,216
Interesting crowd in there.

625
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,720
Same crowd out here.

626
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,418
How about the Einstein thing?

627
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,585
I wonder if old Albert swung his hips
like that when he walked.

628
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,027
She probably got
her hair tips from him, too.

629
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,689
Glen is so quiet.

630
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,426
Not to mention wrinkled.

631
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,300
Maybe she hasn't unpacked
her iron, either.

632
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,499
Christmas paper? Please.

633
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,098
She works.

634
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,008
It has to be hard to run a house, too.

635
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,411
Manning a counter
at a jewelry store?

636
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,005
It's not that demanding.

637
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,144
I don't know. I had a job in sales
before I was a mom.

638
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,983
Have you seen my mom?

639
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,752
No, honey. Maybe she's
in the dining room.

640
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,556
Betty.

641
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,688
What?

642
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,208
Don, will you please go
to Hightop and get the cake?

643
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,726
Hey. Don't run in the house.

644
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,193
What is going on in here?

645
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,287
Your kid knocked over a drink.

646
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,492
You need to tell him
this is not a jungle gym.

647
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,695
Ernie, did you hear what Mr. Farrelly said?

648
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,840
Did you say you were sorry?

649
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,671
Do you want some more?

650
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,507
No. Come on. He heard me.

651
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,605
Go get your mother
and have her clean this up.

652
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,813
Okay. Thank you.

653
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,591
The woman at the bakery said

654
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,754
he picked up the cake
almost an hour ago.

655
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,957
Do you think he had an accident?

656
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,055
Let's go.

657
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,964
We haven't done birthday cake.

658
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,627
There's not going to be a cake.

659
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,796
Am I the only one that knows that?

660
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,443
Don Draper, you are a first class heel,
and I salute you.

661
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,069
Let's go.

662
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,546
Swell party. Food was delicious.

663
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,088
I might have a cake.

664
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,489
A Sara Lee in my freezer.

665
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,618
Well, could you go get it?

666
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,822
Please. That would be so great.

667
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,099
For she's a jolly good fellow

668
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,542
For she's a jolly good fellow

669
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,810
For Sally's a jolly good fellow

670
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:59,720
Which nobody can deny

671
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,055
Happy Birthday, little lady.

672
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,135
Daddy!

673
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,810
Mommy, Mommy, look!

674
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,679
Daddy got me a doggy!

675
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,049
I don't even know what to say.

676
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,488
I want to name her...

677
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,026
Polly! Polly doggy!

678
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:54,965
Come on.

679
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,440
Hey.

680
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,601
Hey.

681
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,844
Happy Birthday, baby.
