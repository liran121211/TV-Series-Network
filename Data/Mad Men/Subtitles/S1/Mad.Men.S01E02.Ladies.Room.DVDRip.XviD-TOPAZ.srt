1
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,211
Should get him to put
another egg in it.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,309
Roger.

3
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,287
Darling, one egg is good.
Two eggs are better.

4
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,458
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,586
that things are getting a little dry
around Hill 29.

6
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,594
Am I wrong?

7
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,221
All clear in No Man's Land.

8
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,230
Betty?

9
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,029
Roger, you've expressed
your desire for another drink.

10
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,603
No need to take the orders.

11
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,728
Right away, sir.

12
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,737
Wine list,

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,571
and I'll have another one of these
while I'm waiting for the list.

14
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,167
Another egg.

15
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,837
Well, I am having fried chicken.

16
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,744
As long as the egg comes first.

17
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,249
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken.

18
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,911
I used to take it to school
wrapped in wax paper.

19
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,579
His sweet Belvedere.

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,986
He really loved that woman.

21
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,082
Had another nanny
originally. German girl.

22
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,889
Round face, enormous bosom.

23
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,555
My parents got rid of her
after the Lindbergh baby.

24
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,223
We thought about getting a nanny.

25
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,028
We have a girl that comes in

26
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,263
who's sort of a housekeeper
and sometimes babysitter.

27
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,432
I'd let her take the children to play group,
sometimes the park.

28
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,600
Belva raised me.

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,972
I turned out just fine.

30
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,808
Didn't have to go to a psychiatrist
like some people's kids.

31
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,506
Oh, what's the big deal?

32
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,676
Margaret is practically the last girl
in our building to go.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,084
16 years old, wouldn't get out of bed.

34
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,056
I tell you, I cannot wait until that girl
is another man's problem.

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,251
What about you, Don?

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,692
Did you have a nanny?

37
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,491
I can't tell you about my childhood.

38
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,589
It would ruin the first half of my novel.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,759
Don doesn't like to talk about himself.

40
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,336
I know better than to ask.

41
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,462
An ad man who doesn't like
to talk about himself?

42
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,937
I think I may cry.

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,736
It's not that interesting a story.

44
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,937
Just think of me as Moses.

45
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,877
I was a baby in a basket.

46
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:33,112
To Moses and Don Draper:
A couple of princes.

47
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,647
If the gentlemen will be patient.

48
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,123
I'll join you.

49
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,399
I think I may know more about your wife
than I do about my own.

50
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,269
Maybe your wife is just a better drinker.

51
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,070
Entirely possible.

52
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,085
Mona, could you help me here?

53
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,424
I seem to have grown a set of thumbs.

54
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,498
Do you ever have that
when your hands go numb?

55
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,527
You want me to touch you up?

56
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,968
Yeah, I think you'll have to.

57
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,204
Look at those lips.

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,508
I'll bet it's not hard for you
to hold on to a man like that.

59
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,081
Don't smile. It'll make it harder.

60
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,783
It's hard to hold on to anything
right now with the... children

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,653
and running the house and...

62
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,918
I don't know if I told you,

63
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,462
but my m-mother died two, three months ago.

64
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,426
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,991
There are other ladies
waiting to use the mirror.

66
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,976
Those purses get any smaller,
we're gonna starve.

67
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,920
I love seeing you like that.

68
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,992
Well, you were sitting on my good side.

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,894
No. I mean, the way
other people see you.

70
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,592
When you're with strangers,
you know exactly what you want.

71
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,261
Well, I like to think
I always know what I want.

72
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,101
Slow down.

73
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,175
I'll have to put that in my diary:

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,245
Lobster Newburg and gimlets
should get a divorce.

75
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,745
They're not getting along very well.

76
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,543
Once you rounded the corner
on number two,

77
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,447
I took it for a case of nerves.

78
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,486
He's your boss.

79
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,022
He likes you.

80
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,560
Toots Shor means he likes me.

81
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,492
When he gets us to the Four Seasons,

82
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,689
then we'll know he trusts me.

83
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,665
Hmm. He seemed very forthcoming.

84
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,794
Yeah. When he's stoned on martinis.

85
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,099
I don't know.

86
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,265
It all seemed like an invitation to you

87
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,833
to con... confide.

88
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,277
Well, maybe it's just manners,

89
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,748
but I was raised to see it
as a sin of pride

90
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,376
to go on like that about yourself.

91
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,478
You're so reverent.

92
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,130
Did you have a nanny?

93
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,728
I've never asked you that.

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,173
Why? What difference does it make?

95
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,802
I don't know.
We've never talked about it.

96
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,442
Did you?

97
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,675
No, of course not.

98
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:59,920
So your mother and father
are responsible for all this?

99
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,392
I'll have to thank them someday.

100
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,326
Jesus, Bets.

101
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,527
It's like politics, religion, or sex.

102
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,432
Why talk about it?

103
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,566
I see your point.

104
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,064
Who is in there?

105
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,342
Peggy, next step is accessories.

106
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,581
$35 a week, minus 6.75 for FICA.

107
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,848
Can you believe it?

108
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,982
Maybe it's the fumes
from the rubber cement on that envelope,

109
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,061
but there's nothing to be happy about here,

110
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,926
although you never forget your first.

111
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,432
For two weeks I've been telling people
I have a job in Manhattan.

112
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,129
Look at you. You're indomitable.

113
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,035
You'd never know you were the very bottom
of the food chain.

114
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,835
Bridget? Are you okay?

115
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,249
Thanks to the Precision Valve Corporation,

116
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,546
for the next 18 months,

117
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,420
Gillette is the only company on Earth
that can spray deodorant out of a can.

118
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,618
Modern deodorant for a modern man.

119
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,059
He prefers jet travel to train travel,

120
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,755
vodka to Scotch,

121
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,959
and he likes to get his news
from the radio, not the paper.

122
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,126
Harold Hill, give it a rest.

123
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,329
"Do not puncture or incinerate. "

124
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,700
Sounds dangerous.

125
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,706
Hey, I got a dud.

126
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,778
How is it a guy as big as you, Ken,

127
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,713
has no basketball skills?

128
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,581
I'm sure more research is needed.

129
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,846
We should try it out.

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,652
Who smells bad in here?

131
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,624
Oh, no. Come on.

132
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,355
- Come on, Kenny.
- Knock it off!

133
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,953
Just pretend it's prom night.

134
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,191
You can be the girl.

135
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,197
Stop!

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,232
Engage rockets.

137
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,233
All right, close your eyes.

138
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,563
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you.

139
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,403
Mr. Cooper is waiting.

140
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,673
I always thought it was Sterling

141
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,771
who was responsible
for the Navy attitude around this place.

142
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,907
Brassiere account.

143
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,009
Just figured out
we can't sell them to men.

144
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,886
So much yarn, so little time.

145
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,264
So Roger mentioned this Nixon thing.

146
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,628
Yeah, he mentioned it.

147
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,099
I just assumed it went away.

148
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,965
It didn't.

149
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,504
Last I read, Nixon was
running without an agency.

150
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,267
Make no mistake, we know better

151
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,776
what Dick Nixon needs
better than Dick Nixon.

152
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,402
What does Dick Nixon think he needs?

153
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,777
What he already has: Ted Rogers,

154
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,214
the brains behind that Checkers broadcast.

155
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,444
See the problem?

156
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,145
He dodged a financial scandal

157
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,620
by standing with his wife
and begging for his dog.

158
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,020
An admission wrapped in a distraction.

159
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,285
I'd say they know what they're doing.

160
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,485
Dogs are winners.

161
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,720
Well, they think they're set without us.

162
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,489
Why chase a girl who doesn't
want to get caught?

163
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,121
You have a problem with Nixon?

164
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,358
I don't vote.

165
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,764
Hear, hear.

166
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,995
But politics aside,

167
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,798
these last eight years have been good to us

168
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,873
because they've been good
to Proctor & Gamble

169
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,738
and The United Fruit Company,
et cetera.

170
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,242
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...

171
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,679
We will give our people
what they want, agreed?

172
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,546
I said cut it out!

173
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,709
Be my pleasure.

174
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,411
Goodie.

175
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,955
Assemble a team.

176
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,457
Start files on contenders:

177
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,617
Symington, Kennedy...

178
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,595
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt
will throw her feedbag into the ring.

179
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,029
Don, you still on for lunch?

180
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,067
No.

181
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,371
Don't tell me that's lunch.

182
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,409
I've got a lot of work to catch up on.

183
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,534
I do that sometimes.

184
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,408
Saunter over to the pie cart.

185
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,481
Egg salad and the worst
cup of coffee in the world.

186
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,480
35 cents.

187
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,448
I've been meaning to try it.

188
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,248
It's okay if you like ptomaine poisoning.

189
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,652
Well, toodle-oo.

190
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,286
Secretary 1, copywriter 0.

191
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,364
It wasn't that.

192
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,457
I bring my lunch at least until after
the first of the month.

193
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,126
Get your things.

194
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,966
That sandwich is making me sad.

195
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,275
It's a postcard from Campbell
on his honeymoon.

196
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,812
Niagara Falls.

197
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,609
"Greetings from the wettest place on earth. "

198
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,716
I say we skip lunch altogether

199
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,845
and try on those narrow sweater sets
I saw at Lord and Taylor.

200
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,685
Do you want me to sit
outside the dressing room

201
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,349
and hold your purse?

202
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,984
What he's trying to say is
can we buy you lunch?

203
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,063
Oh. I don't know.

204
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,529
We hadn't planned on eating.

205
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,656
Come on, three on two.

206
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,961
I know you all like being outnumbered.

207
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,535
That's two on two. I'm married.

208
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,537
You still have to eat lunch.

209
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,698
What do you say? Change of plans?

210
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,207
They do smell nice.

211
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,375
What's that?

212
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,173
Postcard from Pete Campbell.

213
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,679
He's on a honeymoon, right?

214
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,771
Niagara Falls.

215
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,215
He hasn't, uh, left the room, apparently.

216
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,992
Shall we?

217
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,527
So, Pegs, you part of our nation's
military industrial

218
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,730
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?

219
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,828
Excuse me?

220
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,376
He wants to know are you, uh, taken,
are you kept, or merely browsing?

221
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,535
She's browsing.

222
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,873
And like most of us,

223
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,413
she's disappointed
with the selection of merchandise.

224
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,776
Perhaps I can interest you in a 42 long?

225
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,011
That's not his suit size.

226
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,022
She blushes.

227
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,147
No, I don't.

228
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:09,785
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but, uh,
you are the subject of much debate.

229
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,987
Money riding on the outcome.

230
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,155
Money for me?

231
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,357
Now there's even a third possibility:

232
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,627
Paying you.

233
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,969
We should be getting back.

234
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,231
I'll get the check.

235
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,364
My goodness.
Thank you for lunch, boys.

236
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,409
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,547
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

238
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:34,210
We could... go to the zoo,
see what the animals are up to.

239
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,949
I should get back to work.

240
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,524
Or shopping.

241
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,523
Guess I don't see any money
changing hands, Kenny.

242
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,527
You'll see.

243
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,996
My persistence is my charm.

244
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,532
That was delicious.

245
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,069
You enjoy yourself with the Hitler Youth?

246
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,268
Oh. Well, it was kind of last-minute.

247
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,811
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.

248
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,175
Certainly.

249
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,844
You can look, too.

250
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,253
Three of the last PTA presidents
are from the kindergarten class.

251
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,328
I say you go in there
and lay some groundwork.

252
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,454
I will not have Marilyn Kechner
dictate the agenda.

253
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,760
The woman is obsessed with nutrition,

254
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,528
although you wouldn't
know it to look at her.

255
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,002
Francine, you're terrible.

256
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,131
Ooh. I ran into Juanita Cabot
at square dancing,

257
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,142
and I found out who's moving
into that little Dutch Colonial down the street.

258
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,370
Who?

259
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,640
Her name is Helen Bishop.

260
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,215
Is she an old lady?

261
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,613
Divorced.

262
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,015
Really?

263
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,611
9- year-old boy and a baby.

264
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,555
That's awful.

265
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,556
I know.

266
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,683
All on her own?

267
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,886
I know.

268
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,489
Can you imagine worrying about money
at this point in our lives?

269
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,500
Well, obviously,
that's not the worst of it.

270
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,934
No.

271
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,699
No, it isn't.

272
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,036
It is too quiet in there.

273
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,040
Ernie?

274
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,041
Sally?

275
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,203
We're playing spaceman.

276
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,212
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.

277
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,450
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bag
are on the floor of my closet,

278
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,683
you're going to be
a very sorry young lady.

279
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,061
Make sure your brother hasn't climbed
out of the play yard.

280
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,361
Juanita thinks it might be bad
for real estate values in Chilmark.

281
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,025
One divorcée?

282
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,428
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,656
Are you okay?

284
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,525
What's that?

285
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,565
What?

286
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,328
That.

287
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,802
That's a television.

288
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,497
Since when do you have a television?

289
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,599
I don't know. I think it's been about ten days.

290
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,373
It's been so amazing, I sort of lost track.

291
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,947
I seem to remember a woman

292
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,312
wasting a good piece
of a beautiful afternoon

293
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,317
reciting this diatribe against television

294
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,150
that should have ended
with her banging her shoe on the table.

295
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,722
Don, darling, if you want
to ask the question, just ask it.

296
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,296
Where'd you get the TV?

297
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,661
I got it.

298
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,256
Same place you got that wig?

299
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,233
Someone gave it to me.

300
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,732
And you took it?

301
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,536
<i>Have you seen this thing
called People Are Funny?</i>

302
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:54,980
Jesus.

303
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,741
Oh, Jesus, Don.

304
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,845
Hey!

305
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,219
All better?

306
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,758
Yes.

307
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,564
How about a hot dog?

308
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,238
Sit at your places. Come on.

309
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,622
Daddy!

310
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,022
We went to the hospital.

311
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,957
We got lollipops.

312
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,299
They're fine, Don.

313
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,237
What about you?

314
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,170
A little sore.

315
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,639
A little embarrassed.

316
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,869
Sorry they couldn't get a hold of me.

317
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,140
We had to carry Freddie Rumson
out of Ritazzi's.

318
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,147
There was nothing you could have done.

319
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,680
Daddy, use a fork.

320
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,859
How's the car?

321
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,086
Not bad.

322
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,426
Uh, thank God
I was only going 25 tops.

323
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,930
I hate the way you drive, you know.

324
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,830
I'm finished.

325
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,869
<i>Can I go watch
Shirley Temple's Storybook?</i>

326
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,460
Yes, both of you.

327
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,445
So what happened?

328
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,675
I don't know, really.

329
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,515
It... It all happened so fast.

330
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,685
What, 20 miles an hour?

331
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,418
That's not that fast.

332
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,552
It's stupid.

333
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,357
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?

334
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,795
- I've warned her.
- No, she was fine.

335
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,265
She was just sitting there. No.

336
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,030
It was my hands. It happened again.

337
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,239
Jesus.

338
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,444
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.

339
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,017
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough.

340
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,676
I swear, when we walked
down Park Avenue,

341
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,684
I could hear the quacking.

342
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,084
I know. You've said that.

343
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,419
This doctor was nice.

344
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,652
He was older, actually.

345
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,250
He's from Rochester.

346
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,330
He has two children.
They're 10 years apart.

347
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,295
Okay, you've given me his credentials.

348
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,026
What did he say?

349
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,467
Well, he said I could go to New York
and run the dye tests,

350
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,405
and I said that I already had
and that the results were negative,

351
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,373
and he even called Dr. Patterson.

352
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,808
So?

353
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:47,819
They said there was
nothing physically wrong with me.

354
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,512
Then I t-told him what happened,

355
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,250
and he said that I should
see a psychiatrist.

356
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,459
Doctors must love

357
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,864
that they now have an answer
for "I don't know what's wrong. "

358
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,526
He said it could be a nervous condition.

359
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,627
Nervous about what, driving?

360
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,535
So we'll go down to the Grand Union
parking lot.

361
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,664
We'll practice your 10 and 2.

362
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,606
He seemed very concerned,
if you want to know.

363
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,143
But that's their solution.

364
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,611
Why not open the hood
and poke around?

365
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,581
So?

366
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,313
So... I left.

367
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,718
What else am I supposed to do?

368
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,846
Well, go to a doctor...

369
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,117
another doctor, a good one.

370
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,625
I'll get a specialist from Bert Cooper.

371
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,025
His name's on a wall
over at St. Vincent's.

372
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,460
Okay.

373
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,589
Leave the dishes for the girl.

374
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,201
7, 8, 9,

375
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:48,268
10, 11, 12...

376
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,341
98, 99, 100.

377
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,893
You know, I do worry about you, birdie.

378
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,493
I know.

379
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,838
When he brought it up, I was shocked.

380
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,246
Although, I realize that
that's what Dr. Patterson

381
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,513
was trying to say in his own way, and...

382
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,315
it doesn't have...
as much of a stigma today.

383
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,256
I just don't know
what they can possibly tell you.

384
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,299
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?

385
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,241
I always thought people saw a psychiatrist
when they were unhappy.

386
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,911
But I look at you...

387
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,814
and this...

388
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,918
and them...

389
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,289
and that...

390
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,669
and I think, "Are you unhappy?"

391
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,807
Of course I'm happy.

392
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,847
Well, that'll be $35. You're welcome.

393
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,018
Whatever you think is best.

394
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,086
Good.

395
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,646
Act of God. Sorry.

396
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,515
Someone threw themselves
in front of the train.

397
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,679
Ah, suicide.

398
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,088
Okay, boys, what do we have?

399
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:21,662
Gentlemen, the aerosol can
is nothing less than space-age.

400
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,291
It's steel. It has exhaust.

401
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,869
It's even shaped like a rocket.

402
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,404
Certainly an engineering marvel.

403
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,269
"Right Guard:

404
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,899
It works in my suit or yours. "

405
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,570
We'll punch the yellow of the moon
so it pops behind him.

406
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,611
We're looking for new worlds,

407
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,154
and with that search
comes any number of gadgets.

408
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,224
It's not just some random association.

409
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,792
This thing is shiny. It's explosive.

410
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,522
It's from the future,
a place so close to us now,

411
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,461
filled with wonder and ease.

412
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,095
Except some people
think of the future and it upsets them.

413
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,531
They see a rocket,
they start building a bomb shelter.

414
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,335
What? How do you get there?

415
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,843
I don't think it's ridiculous to assume
we're looking for other planets

416
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,936
because this one will end.

417
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,072
I thought we had something here.

418
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,208
Who is this moron flying around space?

419
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,343
I mean, he pees in his pants.

420
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,817
Brass tacks, who buys this?

421
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,053
Some woman.

422
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,494
Your girl or your mother will pick this up

423
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,396
walking through the grocery store
or the druggist's.

424
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,059
We should be asking ourselves,

425
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,431
"What do women want?"

426
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,903
I don't know, but I wish I had it.

427
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,369
Maybe a chesty alien girl
also wants to get into his suit.

428
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,809
I'm not asking "what do women want"

429
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,176
in some bullshit
research psychology way.

430
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,749
I'm asking,
what would make a woman

431
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,479
look at this man's deodorant
and say "I want that"?

432
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,680
Well, I've stopped
trying to figure out what they think.

433
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,347
Maybe I should stop paying you.

434
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,160
Well, I always thought
women like the way we smell.

435
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,822
That explains a lot.

436
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,399
I feel like we're close here.

437
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,798
I mean, this one...

438
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,167
the can's right side up,
but the guy's upside-down.

439
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,740
No. Let's bring it down to Earth.

440
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,841
You think they want a cowboy?

441
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,348
He's quiet and strong.

442
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,353
He always brings the cattle home safe.

443
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,150
You watch TV.

444
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,421
What if they want something else?

445
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,760
Inside, some...

446
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,765
mysterious wish that we're ignoring.

447
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,992
How'd it go?

448
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,785
I've still got my novel.

449
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,386
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,694
Buy me lunch?

451
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,497
Samuel, that drape, man?

452
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,005
It's sadder than a map.

453
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,406
Well, it's lightweight,
and it tells me I'm at work.

454
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,479
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.

455
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,740
60 cents.

456
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,975
What are you doing? Keep the change.

457
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,517
You figured the place out yet?

458
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,679
What do you mean?

459
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,847
How it runs.

460
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,585
I know the copywriters
tell the Art Department what to do,

461
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,457
and I know the account executives
tell the copywriters what to do.

462
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,824
What?

463
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,660
No one tells the writers what to do
except for the head of Creative,

464
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,326
your boss, Donald Draper.

465
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,633
Don't think that just because
he's good-looking, he's not a writer.

466
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,671
Dig.

467
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,502
This is the Media Department.

468
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,600
They're where 90% of where
the client's check goes.

469
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,509
They buy space... newspapers,
billboards, television,

470
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,583
and my favorite aging whore, radio.

471
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,743
That's the whole shakedown, actually.

472
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,343
All you really need to know.

473
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,015
They don't sell ideas
or campaigns or jingles.

474
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,524
They sell media at a 15% markup.

475
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,855
Creative is just window dressing

476
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,859
that's thrown in for free.

477
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,190
Really?

478
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,231
Accounting, they keep track
of how much we're spending

479
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,424
versus how much we're taking in,

480
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,125
and since we're buying futures,

481
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,934
if you ever, ever see, um,
the man upstairs go in there,

482
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,337
grab the lifeboats, baby.

483
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,204
We're going down.

484
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,143
Account Management,

485
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,343
<i>where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm,
Wizard of Oz style,</i>

486
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,478
joined together by their lack of skill
and their love of mirrors.

487
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
Account executives
are all good at something,

488
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:44,491
although it's never advertising.

489
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,828
Submitted for your approval:
One Peter Campbell,

490
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,491
a man who recently discovered

491
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,561
that the only place for his hand
is in your pocket.

492
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,664
You watch it?

493
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,640
<i>Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone?</i>

494
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,837
I don't think so.
I don't like science fiction.

495
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,141
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

496
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,479
Mitch in Media says
CBS might pull the plug.

497
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,017
I'll kill myself.

498
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,186
And here we have
the Creative Department,

499
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,194
the talent, home sweet home.

500
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,230
Like the Art Department downstairs,

501
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,595
they put us far enough
away from the elevators

502
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,498
so we can't sneak out.

503
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,542
You know,

504
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,510
there are women copywriters.

505
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,273
- Good ones?
- Sure.

506
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,214
I mean, y-you can always tell
when a woman's writing copy,

507
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,878
but sometimes she just might be
the right man for the job, you know?

508
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,157
You must be very creatively satisfied.

509
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,726
Let's not lose our heads.

510
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,854
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon.

511
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,023
I have a friend... I'm not even going
to say what agency...

512
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,397
but all they do is smoke Mary Jane
and play darts,

513
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,027
and honestly, I think
they're the best store on the street.

514
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,765
You like Ukrainian food?

515
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,037
Oxtail dumplings?

516
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,204
I still have a lot of work to do.

517
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,804
I think he's still in there.

518
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,109
Huh. Got it.

519
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,352
Thanks for lunch.
Sorry about your copy.

520
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,422
Thanks for reminding me.

521
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,139
Can never get used
to the fact that most of the time

522
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,643
it looks like you're doing nothing.

523
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,978
Fix you something?

524
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,983
4:30. Close enough.

525
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,177
Coop is gonna want a carve-in

526
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,277
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,

527
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:54,586
and I warn you right now,
it includes Pete Campbell.

528
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,319
I should go to Niagara Falls for two weeks.

529
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,894
Does wonders for your career.

530
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,725
Niagara Falls.

531
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,356
Boy redefines lack of imagination.

532
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,836
Ah. That's where you've been.

533
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,466
Let me ask you something.

534
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,804
What do women want?

535
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,936
Who cares?

536
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,842
You mentioned the other night

537
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,476
that your daughter
had been to a psychiatrist.

538
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,649
I'm sure you must be mistaken about that.

539
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,227
You know what?

540
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,128
I am very comfortable with my mind:
Thoughts clean and unclean,

541
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,996
loving and... the opposite of that.

542
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:40,127
But I'm not a woman.

543
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,762
And I think it behooves any man

544
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,866
to toss all female troubles
into the hands of a stranger.

545
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,604
We had one headshrinker in the army.

546
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:51,045
A gossip, busting
with other people's thoughts.

547
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,014
Hasn't changed much, just costs more.

548
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,641
And you can't shoot at them.

549
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,980
We live in troubling times.

550
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,384
We do?

551
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,754
Who could not be happy with all this?

552
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,191
Jesus, you know what they want?

553
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,454
Everything.

554
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,292
Especially if the other girls have it.

555
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:12,062
Trust me, psychiatry is just
this year's candy-pink stove.

556
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,235
It's just more happiness.

557
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,617
<i>People...</i>

558
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:30,752
<i>Are...</i>

559
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,687
<i>Funnyl</i>

560
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,950
Beauty and the beast.

561
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,255
Hey, Daddy.

562
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,764
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?

563
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,333
Yeah.

564
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,802
Someone started on the train.

565
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,069
In the office.

566
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,043
Because of a good day or a bad day?

567
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,209
You know, when I told you
you had everything...

568
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,718
I was wrong.

569
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,321
Oh, my God.

570
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,653
White gold.

571
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:17,428
It's got one of those tiny little faces
that you have to be young to see.

572
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,400
Don, it's beautiful.

573
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,599
The guy at the store set the time,
but he was English,

574
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,768
so it might be six hours off.

575
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,574
Did you look at Sally's face?

576
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,978
I think she has a bruise.

577
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,242
I didn't see it.

578
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,511
On her cheekbone under her eye.

579
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,018
I thought that was ketchup.

580
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,113
What if she had gotten a scar,
something permanent?

581
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,021
I don't want to play what-if.

582
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,686
I'm just saying if it happened to Bobby
it would have been okay

583
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,459
because a boy with a scar is nothing,
but a girl, it's so much worse.

584
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,624
Nothing happened.

585
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,668
I keep...

586
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,827
thinking...

587
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,737
Not that I c-could have killed the kids,

588
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:03,109
but... worse.

589
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,843
Sally could have survived...

590
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,249
and gone on living with this...

591
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,518
horrible scar on her face, and...

592
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:18,027
some long, lonely...

593
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,997
miserable life as...

594
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,692
Don.

595
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,947
What's happening to me?

596
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,382
Do I need to see someone?

597
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,326
I don't know.

598
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,730
I guess so.

599
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,993
Whatever you want.

600
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,612
11 a. m. Did you get fired?

601
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,278
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,

602
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,619
but, uh, honestly...

603
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,491
I think I'm the one that's not feeling so great.

604
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,756
I called in sick.

605
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,560
Don't bring that here.

606
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,465
I'm serious, Don.
Don't talk to me about her.

607
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,763
It makes me feel cruel.

608
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,979
You're right.

609
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,914
Sometimes.

610
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,388
I can't decide

611
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,584
if you have everything...

612
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,422
or nothing.

613
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,462
I live in the moment.

614
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,229
Nothing is everything.

615
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,607
Sounds more like you live in the Village.

616
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,075
Actually, I live in the hall.

617
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,645
I lost my key.

618
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,045
I had to, um...
spend the night abroad.

619
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,777
Could you be a gentleman

620
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,911
and break in to the fire escape
so I don't have to?

621
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,963
Draper in yet?

622
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,125
He's not coming in today.
He's not feeling well.

623
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,931
I'm leaving. Don't tell anyone I was here.

624
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,737
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

625
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,215
No, it's Peggy.

626
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,543
Hello.

627
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,118
I don't think I can go out to lunch today.

628
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,623
Mr. Draper's not coming in.

629
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,058
That means you can go out to lunch.

630
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,062
Have you never worked
in an office before?

631
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,893
Well, he could call.

632
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,988
It's my second week.

633
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,567
Another time?

634
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,693
I did enjoy the tour the other day.

635
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,031
It was eye-opening.

636
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,107
I didn't think your eyes
could be any wider.

637
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,607
That's clever.

638
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,608
I guess I'll go to the cart.
You want something?

639
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,286
What?

640
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,512
The office is gonna
empty out any second.

641
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,386
We can push the couch
in front of the door.

642
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,517
Paul.

643
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,892
Do you belong to someone else?

644
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,557
Shit.

645
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,635
I don't even like to sit in Don's chair.

646
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,760
I think we've
misunderstood each other.

647
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,541
But there is someone else, right?

648
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:54,702
Yes.

649
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,630
I hope you know that covering
your typewriter

650
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,135
is office code for "I'm done for the day. "

651
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,569
I'm not feeling so swell.

652
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,130
Neither am I. Look at these letters
you typed after lunch.

653
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:30,510
Terre Haute, Indiana,
has two Rs and an A and an E at the end.

654
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,344
I think either you missed
home row by a hand,

655
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,680
or you were out drinking
with the junior account boys again.

656
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,683
I wasn't drinking.

657
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,515
I don't like your tone.

658
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,990
I'll redo these right away.

659
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,356
Look at you, all in a snit.

660
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,389
Are you gonna watch me?

661
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,725
What is wrong with you?

662
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,093
Honestly, why is it that every time

663
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,228
a man takes you
out to lunch around here,

664
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,169
you're... you're the dessert?

665
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,400
That's terrible.

666
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,408
It's constant from every corner.

667
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,035
I'm from Bay Ridge. We have manners.

668
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,773
Why can't they just leave it alone?

669
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,145
Because men always
bother you all the time.

670
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,650
They follow you down the street.

671
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,277
Well, not exactly.

672
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,084
Look, dear, I don't know you that well,

673
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,953
but you're the new girl,
and you're not much,

674
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,357
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

675
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,361
Of course.

676
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,691
Don't be that way.

677
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,766
I'm just offering some perspective, that's all.

678
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,196
Thank you, Joan.

679
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,703
I'll save my thank-yous

680
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,636
till you correct that correspondence.

681
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,585
I don't know why I'm here.

682
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,454
I'm... I mean, I do.

683
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,430
I'm... nervous, I guess.

684
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,364
Anxious.

685
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,900
I don't sleep that well.

686
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,599
And my hands...

687
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,539
Well, they're fine now.

688
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,749
It's like when you have
a problem with your car

689
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,309
and you go to the mechanic
and it's not doing it anymore.

690
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,783
Not that you are a mechanic.

691
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,994
I guess a lot of people must come here
worried about the bomb.

692
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,468
Is that true?

693
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,709
It's a common nightmare, people say.

694
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,779
I read it in a magazine.

695
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:01,489
My mother always told me
that it wasn't polite to talk about yourself.

696
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,157
She passed away recently.

697
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,361
I guess I already said that.

698
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,802
Can I smoke in here?

699
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,069
We're all so lucky to be here.

700
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,568
It's 7:30.

701
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,542
I have to go to Roy's reading.

702
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,582
I have to be there to act surprised
when Jack Kerouac doesn't show.

703
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,717
Lock the door when you leave.

704
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,755
If you're gonna go home,
take a shower.

705
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,229
You stink.

706
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,527
It's because I'm a man.

707
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,660
You seem to forget that sometimes.

708
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,203
I'm lucky they aren't all like you.

709
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,932
I'll take that as a compliment.

710
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,343
What do women want?

711
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,882
Well, one of the things has to be
not being asked something like that.

712
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,543
"What do women want?

713
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,780
You know better than to ask. "

714
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,059
Give me a pen.

715
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,560
Jesus.

716
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,363
"What do women want?"

717
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,435
"Any excuse to get closer. "

718
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,944
Thank God.

719
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,080
There's that ego people pay to see.

720
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,523
I'll have the filet of sole.

721
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,821
Excellent.

722
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,260
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?

723
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,262
Spinach.

724
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,662
Fried potatoes or au gratin?

725
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,166
Au gratin. With tomato juice to start.

726
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,395
I'll have a goulash.

727
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:27,993
Very good, sir.

728
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,607
Vodka gimlet.

729
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,110
Old-fashioned.

730
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,711
How was your day?

731
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:48,618
Fine.

732
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,694
You know, I work with doctors.

733
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,386
They'll say anything you pay them to.

734
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,726
Of course, dear.

735
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,800
Dinner in the city.

736
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,458
I'm glad I'm hungry.

737
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,532
<i>I saw an interesting thing
in the Journal American.</i>

738
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,698
Apparently, the phone company

739
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,937
wants to start charging people
for unlisted numbers.

740
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,603
That doesn't seem fair.

741
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:10,805
Some people agree with you,

742
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,381
and they're giving aliases to Ma Bell.

743
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,950
They call it the nom-de-phone.

744
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,315
Isn't that smart?

745
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,116
Of course, most of them
are pornographic.

746
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,419
The best one?

747
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,493
Pat McGroin.

748
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,494
Oh, my God.

749
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,961
Hard to believe they could print that

750
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,861
<i>in the Journal American,
let alone a phone book.</i>

751
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,535
This is nice.

752
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,395
I'll be right up.

753
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,312
Hello.

754
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,546
Sorry to bother you so late.

755
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,644
It's Don Draper.

756
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,246
Oh, hello, Mr. Draper.

757
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,484
No, no. It's not too late at all.

758
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,458
Glad to hear that.

759
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,086
Well?

760
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:37,896
Well, I had a very interesting hour
with your wife this afternoon.

761
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,835
She's a very anxious young woman.

762
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,907
I think you're doing the right thing.
