1
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,972
I like this for the powder room,
but definitely not the bedroom.

2
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,132
It's a little busy.

3
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,573
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,144
It's not the curtains
I'm worried about, but the cabinets.

5
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,806
Nixon didn't stand a chance.

6
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,147
The Browns trounced
the Redskins, 31-10.

7
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,880
The result of that last home game

8
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,446
has correctly predicted
the last six elections.

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,425
I wish someone would have told me that.

10
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,487
Of course, it's really
a 50/50 chance of being right.

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,269
I want to treat you like a son because...
I feel that way towards you.

12
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,468
Okay.

13
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,842
Trudy told us that you
were up for a promotion

14
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,972
and you didn't get it or something.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,550
I wish she hadn't.

16
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,313
Now, she loves you.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,910
And honestly,

18
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,889
I think you need
to take a little focus off your work.

19
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,154
This from one of the top
salesmen at Vicks Chemical.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,558
When you started talking

21
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,790
about that Clearasil
company you bought...

22
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,559
Now, that was kind of
worth bragging about.

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,135
Did you know that there's a surge
in adolescence right now?

24
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,263
I'll tell you, Sterling Cooper
and yours truly

25
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,898
would love to help you
deliver that message.

26
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,136
See? Now that's what I'm talking about.

27
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,042
The only family and business
you should be mixing

28
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,615
is the production of a child.

29
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,809
And what did Trudy say about that?

30
00:01:58,918 --> 00:01:59,942
About what?

31
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,784
Tom, loose lips sink ships.

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,824
I was just saying that work
isn't everything, you know.

33
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,383
It's like that song says:
Um, tend your own garden.

34
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,157
What song is that, Daddy?

35
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,196
Uh, I don't know.

36
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,265
People say it. It's true.

37
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,333
It is true.

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,662
Yeah. Tend to your own garden.

39
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,932
That means... you know,
start growing things.

40
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,404
Daddy!

41
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,736
You're embarrassing us.

42
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,072
It'll be the best Christmas present
this one ever had.

43
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,907
And hell, Thanksgiving's Thursday.

44
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:37,850
Oh, and I guess I should go to Keppler Farm
to get some acorn squash.

45
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,255
What am I doing?
They have squash there.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,260
Ery good squash, actually.

47
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,431
I wish you would come.

48
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,163
Birdie, I'm a partner.

49
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,865
80% of my business
rolls out next week.

50
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,065
It just seems silly for me

51
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,303
to go down there
for a 12-hour Thanksgiving.

52
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,576
What about... Sally and Bobby's
childhood memories?

53
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,443
There was no reason
you couldn't have it up here.

54
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,455
You know my brother's
children are animals.

55
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,854
They can't make the trip up here,

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,483
and I don't want my dad to be alone.

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:20,633
I'll take a cab to the train,
and William will pick us up,

58
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,963
probably in some new car.

59
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,775
You know what? L...

60
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,304
I don't think you want to go.

61
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,275
I'm sorry. Was I unclear about that?

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,387
I don't understand

63
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,084
why you can't make
my family your family.

64
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,293
Ken is perfectly happy to have me here.

65
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,703
What do you think it's like?
He's a bachelor. It's dirty.

66
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,642
I'm not complaining.

67
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't think it's a good idea
to spend money on a hotel right now.

68
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,554
If you're so worried about my well-being,
let me come home.

69
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,049
That's not what I meant.

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,090
I mean, I know how it sounded.

71
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,193
Jennifer.

72
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,008
Yes.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,880
I'll quit if you let me come home.

74
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,948
I miss you...

75
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,923
so much.

76
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,209
Those the legendary
secret files of Bert Cooper?

77
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,437
No.

78
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,605
I got a call from Abraham Menken.

79
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,706
I'm sure you know
that his daughter will be unavailable

80
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,148
for the next three months,

81
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:24,383
taking some sort of ocean voyage
to Paris and whatnot.

82
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,287
I hadn't heard that.

83
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,256
But otherwise?

84
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,388
There is no otherwise.

85
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,935
Why is this man calling me?

86
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,937
I don't know. Is he unhappy?

87
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,338
As a partner, I do not expect
your personal preferences

88
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,411
to interfere with our business.

89
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,308
Who says they have?

90
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,040
It was the tone of his voice.

91
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,445
He's her father.

92
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
That's it, cowboy.

93
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,393
Francine.

94
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,464
I'm coming in. I'm freezing.

95
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,359
You're in your slippers.

96
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,198
I've been outside
waiting for you to come home,

97
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,068
just sitting in the car
hoping no one would see me.

98
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,606
What's going on?

99
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,039
Are your kids home?

100
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,407
No. What happened?

101
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,442
I'm so stupid.

102
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,481
So damn stupid.

103
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,486
You're not, Francine.

104
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,558
Whatever happened, you're not stupid.

105
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,253
My mind hasn't been so sharp
since I had the baby.

106
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,852
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,

107
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,455
and honestly I think I just threw it away.

108
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,261
And four days later,
the phone was cut off,

109
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:47,237
so I had to go to the phone company
and pay it, or, you know, he'd have a fit.

110
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,036
And I had to do all this
without him knowing.

111
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,633
How perfect.

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,208
I don't understand.

113
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,749
They gave me the bill.

114
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,246
It was close to $18.

115
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,326
There were all these calls:

116
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,328
Long distance, MH.

117
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,830
MH? Manhattan?

118
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,462
So I called one.

119
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,205
A woman answered.

120
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,606
I had just...

121
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,510
I said, "I'm calling
from Carlton Hanson's office. "

122
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,275
She said, "Really?"

123
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,444
I said, "He wants to have dinner
tonight at the usual place. "

124
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,385
What made you say that?

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,723
What woman would he
be calling in Manhattan

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,324
who answers her own phone?

127
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,862
Married women.

128
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,373
Lots of women answer
their own phones.

129
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,673
So he's calling some married woman
from my house

130
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,907
while I'm upstairs sleeping?

131
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,313
Maybe it's a caterer.

132
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,080
Maybe he's throwing you
a surprise party.

133
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,192
Do you know he spends
two nights a week at the Waldorf?

134
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,289
I'm so stupid.

135
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,163
Assuming the worst...

136
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,040
The worst is that I'll poison him.

137
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,904
He's so stupid, he'd drink anything.

138
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,144
I'm going to have
a house full of people.

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,877
I'll poison them all:

140
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,445
His parents, my parents...

141
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,716
my kids.

142
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,223
Stop it.

143
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,589
Stop that, Francine.

144
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,260
You're emotional. It doesn't mean...

145
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,562
Damn it, Betty. I know everything.

146
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,397
What am I going to do?

147
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,698
I've been sitting outside in the car.

148
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,365
What do I do? I thought
you'd know what to do.

149
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,009
Me? L... Why?

150
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,374
I don't know.

151
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,924
I'm s...

152
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,328
so embarrassed.

153
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,360
He doesn't know you know.

154
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,801
I know that.

155
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,764
Go on upstairs.

156
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,275
I should go.

157
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,811
Come on, Bobby,
let's go play in my room.

158
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,938
No. Don't.

159
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,074
It'll be okay.

160
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,880
Mrs. Draper, sorry I'm late.

161
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,979
Oh. It's okay, Carla. You can go.

162
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,557
You want me to unpack the groceries?

163
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,956
I'll do it. Just go.

164
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,858
Good-bye.

165
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,473
First things first.

166
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,946
When I call a meeting,

167
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,574
if you arrive after me, you are late.

168
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,012
Boys, the stock in our stable:

169
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,614
Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Maytag.

170
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,183
No automobile, airline,
pharmaceuticals.

171
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,889
Tobacco is on that list.

172
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,556
You're Cosgrove, right?

173
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,569
The powerhouse
behind the Rejuvenator?

174
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,198
Actually, it's called
the Relax-a-Cizor now.

175
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,638
What the hell is it?

176
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,337
It's a weight loss device
with a female pleasure payload.

177
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,606
Really?

178
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,475
I'm offering a hundred-dollar bonus

179
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,543
to the first man who brings me
a meeting with a decision maker.

180
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,455
Gentlemen, here's a list of people
you should be having lunch with.

181
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,585
I want you to run into people,
go through old yearbooks.

182
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,665
This means everybody. Writers, too.

183
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,164
Bringing in business is the key

184
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,929
to your salary, your status,
and your self-worth.

185
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,628
I went to the Athletic Club today,

186
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,536
and I sat in the steam
for an hour and a half.

187
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,199
In that time, I lost 4 pounds

188
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,038
and learned that Kodak still isn't happy

189
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,044
with the campaign
for the new slide projector.

190
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,410
Is any of this sinking in?

191
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,545
"It's true that while simply relaxing,

192
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,420
"I can get all the benefits
of calisthenics.

193
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,926
"A simple regimen of three
20-minute sessions per week,

194
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,826
"combined with a sensible diet,

195
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,058
"will restore your youthful glow.

196
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,930
"I love the way it makes me feel.

197
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,469
"The Relax-a-Cizor.

198
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,664
It's my little secret. "

199
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,404
Thank you, Annie.

200
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,173
Uh, one more time... Rita.

201
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,416
"I never thought it would happen to me,

202
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,384
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

203
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,250
- Just ask my husband. "
- Todd?

204
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,380
I think we're both going
to agree on Annie.

205
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,822
Which one is Annie?

206
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,486
Believe it or not, I like Rita.

207
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,225
She's got that voice:
Randy and knowing,

208
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,732
like the Relax-a-Cizor.

209
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,326
Annie belongs on TV
with Rita's voice dubbed in.

210
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,031
Norma, thank you.

211
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,166
You can go.

212
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,840
Whatever the...

213
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,313
special properties
of the Relax-a-Cizor are,

214
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,750
what we are selling is confidence,
a better you.

215
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,515
That woman isn't a better anything.

216
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:16,084
Annie is a confident, beautiful woman,
and you can hear it in her voice.

217
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,663
I can't believe I'm in this argument.

218
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,493
Sorry about that, Rita.

219
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,590
Hi, Annie. We'll do this tomorrow.

220
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,100
Check with Peggy here
for your session.

221
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,530
If I get a hard time about this,

222
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm telling people it was your idea.

223
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,007
It was my idea.

224
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,118
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

225
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,998
Do you have to?

226
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,728
Peter.

227
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,238
That's risky business.

228
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,501
It is, isn't it?

229
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,175
What, honey?

230
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,409
You can say anything to me.

231
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,996
I can't provide for a child
on what I make.

232
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,430
Don't worry about that.

233
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,471
How could I not?

234
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,302
You can't.

235
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,869
Really?

236
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,573
You can't worry about that.

237
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,392
So stay here.

238
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,736
Oh... Peter.

239
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,555
Hi, Birdie.

240
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,460
It's 9:30. Why didn't you
just stay in the city?

241
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,090
Oh, I have work to do here as well.

242
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,465
Do you know where
the slide projector is?

243
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,834
So you're not going
to see us for four days,

244
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,703
and you're not going to see us now.

245
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,537
Bets, right when I walk in the door?

246
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,410
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,142
I'm sorry. I just... I had a terrible day.

248
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,417
Sit with me.

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,258
What happened?

250
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,565
Francine told me

251
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,504
Carlton has been having an affair.

252
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,571
Really?

253
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,705
She was in pieces, Don.

254
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,010
I didn't know what to say to her.

255
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,052
Well, what could you say?

256
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,711
I'm surprised she told you.

257
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,585
Why?

258
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,817
She's like a sister to me.

259
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,087
Of course she is.

260
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,594
I never liked Carlton.

261
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,762
He was never my favorite.

262
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,272
She should poison him.

263
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,003
Now you think she should kill him?

264
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,013
How could someone do that
to the person that they love?

265
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,312
That they have children with?

266
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,945
Doesn't this all mean anything?

267
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,755
Who knows why people
do what they do?

268
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
Come on.

269
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,899
Bring the wine.

270
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,354
It's actually a hell of a gadget.

271
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,426
It's continuous, doesn't jam.

272
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,927
They call it the Doughnut or the Wheel.

273
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,293
They're expecting something
along those lines.

274
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,865
Kodak reinvented the wheel.

275
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,558
They're going to hear that ten times.

276
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,798
They want you to use the words Research
and Development in the ads.

277
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,000
But if you could find a way
to put the Wheel and the Future

278
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,371
into something with some legs,

279
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,911
you could make me look good
my first month here.

280
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,524
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

281
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,925
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

282
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,827
"Just ask my husband.

283
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,335
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met.

284
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,267
"It's true that while simply relaxing

285
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,804

286
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,669
I'm sorry. We have to get a level here.

287
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,436
No, we don't.

288
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,035
She doesn't sound very confident.

289
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,115
She just started.

290
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,843
Give her a direction.

291
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,620
Okay, Annie.

292
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,985
Confidence.

293
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,660
Okay.

294
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,524
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

295
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,997
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

296
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,590
"Just ask my husband.

297
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,331
I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met. "

298
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,531
Annie.

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,607
Yes?

300
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,732
Are you married?

301
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,332
No.

302
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,968
I could have told you that.

303
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:12,610
Well, try and imagine
you're you, Annie,

304
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,015
and now you have everything.

305
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,882
You're beautiful, you're slim,

306
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,424
you're the beloved prize
of a handsome man,

307
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,086
and you have everything when
you use the Relax-a-Cizor.

308
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,355
Okay.

309
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,432
It's too bad your voice is so annoying.

310
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,764
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

311
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,236
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

312
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,966
Just ask my husband. "

313
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,166
Hold on, Annie.

314
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,574
We have a problem
with the tape recorder.

315
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,371
Say something to her.

316
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,916
Make her feel beautiful.

317
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,883
You know, the confidence
that comes with beauty.

318
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,716
Pegs, a woman who looks like that
will never sound confident

319
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,289
because she never is confident.

320
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,517
Baloney.

321
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,320
Honey, it's God's gift to bachelors.

322
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,895
The juiciest gazelle
is the easiest to catch.

323
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,261
Can I... I have a bit of a cold in my throat.

324
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,357
Can I get some pineapple juice?

325
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,698
There's a glass of water in the corner.

326
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,362
It's great for your throat.

327
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,032
I didn't believe that, either.

328
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,138
Let's try it again, Annie.

329
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,613
Happy, confident, beautiful.

330
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,349
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

331
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,581
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

332
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,317
"Just ask my husband.

I swear, he looks at me
like the night we"...

334
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,549
Annie.

335
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,420
You're married.

336
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,398
Maybe you put on a few pounds,

337
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,627
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,

338
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:42,173
and you're back to being you, right now.

339
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,040
I don't know that I understand.

340
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,874
Annie, what don't you understand?

341
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,944
I am being me.

342
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,345
Just give me a second.

343
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,286
I'll get it the way you want it.

344
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,462
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

345
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,766
"I never thought this
would happen to me, but... "

346
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,268
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"...

347
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,105
Look, Pegs, you dangled her
in front of me,

348
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,373
and now you're ruining it.

349
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,573
Don't do that to me.

350
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,150
Kenny, be professional, would you?

351
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,377
This is not working out.

352
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,284
We're going to have to let you go.

353
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,684
You could have gone
in there and said that.

354
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,362
In this order,

355
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,460
I want you to go after her
and console her.

356
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,632
And after you make plans
or whatever you need to do,

357
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,834
call Rita.

358
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,638
The older lady you liked?

359
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,975
She's probably home
with the Relax-a-Cizor right now.

360
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,168
Can you get me the, uh...

361
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,003
the Brighton Hotel, Times Square?

362
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,305
Brighton.

363
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,279
<i>Yes. Uh, sorry to bother you so late.</i>

364
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,544
<i>I'm looking for someone.</i>

365
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,017
A tenant of yours

366
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,782
some... some months back.

367
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,787
A guest.

368
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,221
<i>Yes. Uh,</i>

369
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,919
I'd love to know if he left
a forwarding address.

370
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,585
His name is...

371
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,822
Adam Whitman.

372
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,660
Right. Can I ask what you want?

373
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,200
Just a forwarding address.

374
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,360
I'm trying to contact him.

375
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,904
He has red hair...

376
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,473
over 6 feet.

377
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,634
<i>Now listen. I know
who you're talking about.</i>

378
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:38,175
Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this,

379
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,511
but he hung himself.

380
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,045
What?

381
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,348
<i>Yeah.</i>

382
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,188
Adam Whitman.

383
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,725
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

384
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,852
Left the building a bunch of money.

385
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,088
The city took it.

386
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,824
<i>It was in the Post.</i>

387
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,763
Oh.

388
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,891
<i>Well,</i>

389
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,493
I hate to be the one to give that news.

390
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,204
Okay.

391
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,108
<i>Hello.</i>

392
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,980
Yes. Hello.

393
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,050
<i>Who is this?</i>

394
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,554
Who is this?

395
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,149
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.

396
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,032
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you,
this is inappropriate.

397
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,300
Are we on fire?

398
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,866
Don.

399
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:54,544
No. I, uh... dropped a cigarette
in my waste basket.

400
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,342
Harry, come here. I want to talk to you.

401
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,241
Okay.

402
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,400
Harry, I want to talk to you.

403
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,338
I can explain.

404
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,834
What is the benefit of that thing?

405
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,147
It sells projectors to people
who already have them.

406
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,619
Yeah, the wheel.

407
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,088
Stacks, you store your slides in it,

408
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,659
and it's ready to go.

409
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,729
I took pictures for the paper at Wisconsin.

410
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,195
The machinery is definitely
part of the fun.

411
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,322
It's mechanical.

412
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,230
What did you take pictures of?

413
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,428
Girls, mostly.

414
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
You could go up and ask them
their names afterwards

415
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,367
like you were going to put it in the paper.

416
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,966
And some other stuff.

417
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,103
Artsy-craftsy stuff.

418
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,612
They gave me hell about it.

419
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,909
Artsy, like what?

420
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,282
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?

421
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,752
Uh, worse.

422
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:16,452
I did a whole series
that was just handprints on glass.

423
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,390
You know, the way
it fogs up around your heat.

424
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,932
Take it off, take a picture.

425
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,126
Black and white, I suppose.

426
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,327
Of course.

427
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,398
I was always fascinated
by the cave paintings of Lascaux.

428
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,409
They're, like, 17,000 years old.

429
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,105
The bison get all the attention,

430
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,672
but there are also
all of these handprints,

431
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,581
tiny by today's standards,

432
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,382
with paint blown all around them.

433
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,821
Signature of the artist.

434
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:52,391
But I thought it was like someone...

435
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,900
reaching through the stone
and right to us.

436
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,563
"I was here. "

437
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,176
Are you okay?

438
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,511
That'll be all.

439
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:15,037
Glen?

440
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,178
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

441
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,348
Who says... Who said that?

442
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,889
My mother and my father.

443
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,319
I don't care.

444
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,087
My mother's going to come out.

445
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,068
I don't care.

446
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,398
Glen...

447
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,343
I can't talk to anyone.

448
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,443
It's so horrible.

449
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,420
I'm so sad.

450
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,073
Don't cry.

451
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,670
Please...

452
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,416
Please tell me I'll be okay.

453
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,656
I don't know.

454
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,794
I wish I was older.

455
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,364
Oh, adults don't know anything, Glen.

456
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,466
I don't really know
how long 20 minutes is.

457
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,275
Of course, dear.

458
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,180
Don, I hope I'm not bothering you.

459
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:12,957
I just wanted to let you know
I took Duck's talk very seriously.

460
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,760
And without having to crack
my Deerfield yearbook,

461
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,926
I've brought in an account.

462
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,368
Good for you.

463
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,939
It's a piece of Vicks Chemical Company.

464
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,008
Clearasil.

465
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,303
Better potential

466
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,276
than any traditional
pharmaceutical, I believe.

467
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,007
That's a real account, Campbell.

468
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,912
How'd that happen?

469
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,416
I'm not embarrassed to say

470
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,488
my father-in-law's a former salesman,
now executive there.

471
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,351
That's generous.

472
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,949
He's interested in my future.

473
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,119
Congratulations.

474
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm sure, with a little bit of lawyering,
you're entitled to that bonus.

475
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,493
I got the bonus.

476
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,160
And Cooper gave me
some book by Ayn Rand.

477
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,103
He seemed assured, as I hope you are,

478
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,800
that I have a significant
investment in this company.

479
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,242
Well, you do now, don't you?

480
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,550
It matters to me that you're impressed.

481
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,920
I am.

482
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,982
Self-worth and status.

483
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,026
You said it.

484
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,801
Thanksgiving.

485
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,603
It's very n-nerve-wracking,

486
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,877
having to deal with getting
the family together.

487
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,181
My m... My mother didn't...

488
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,417
cook last year
because she was so sick.

489
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,790
And now I'm going
to have to deal with Gloria.

490
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,796
But it is Thanksgiving, and...

491
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,236
I'm grateful for things.

492
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,974
Like this.

493
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,310
This has helped.

494
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,475
Don doesn't think so, but it has.

495
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,021
Being able to talk.

496
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,324
Just... Just me and you
and your little pad.

497
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,930
It has helped.

498
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,761
Still, I...

499
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:12,571
I can't help but think
that I would be happy

500
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,908
if my husband was faithful to me.

501
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,150
My brother's children are
very badly behaved, and...

502
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,661
he spanks them.

503
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,630
Don has never laid a hand on the kids.

504
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,065
He's kind inside.

505
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,198
But outside, it...

506
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,043
it's all there in my face every day.

507
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,306
The hotel rooms.

508
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,379
Sometimes perfume...

509
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,282
or worse.

510
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,626
He doesn't know what family is.

511
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,192
He doesn't even have one.

512
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,403
It makes me sorry for him...

513
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,937
when in fact I...

514
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,810
I should be angry...

515
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,441
very angry, you know?

516
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:33,989
But I put up with it, like some ostrich.

517
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,655
It's interesting, isn't it?

518
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,491
The way he m...

519
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,584
he makes love...

520
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,028
sometimes it's what I want.

521
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,430
But sometimes it's obviously
what someone else wants.

522
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,825
I suppose it means I'm not enough.

523
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,865
But maybe it...

524
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,303
it's just him.

525
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,846
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,

526
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,582
this is Joe Harriman and Lynn Taylor.

527
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,055
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.

528
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,489
They're all back in the lab.

529
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,790
It's a wonderful facility,
but they don't take vacations.

530
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,921
What do they show,
slides of them working?

531
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,768
So have you figured out a way
to work the wheel into it?

532
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:27,997
We know it's hard

533
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,539
because wheels aren't really seen
as exciting technology,

534
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,040
even though they are the original.

535
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:38,013
Well, technology is a glittering lure,

536
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,310
but there's the rare occasion

537
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,819
when the public can be engaged
on the level beyond flash,

538
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:48,756
if they have a sentimental
bond with the product.

539
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,091
My first job,
I was in house at a fur company

540
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,928
with this old pro copyrighter,
a Greek named Teddy.

541
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:02,973
And Teddy told me the most
important idea in advertising is "new. "

542
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,736
Creates an itch.

543
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,538
You simply put your product in there

544
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,079
as a kind of... calamine lotion.

545
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:16,514
He also talked about a deeper bond
with the product.

546
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,952
Nostalgia.

547
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,219
It's delicate...

548
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,453
but potent.

549
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,927
Sweetheart.

550
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,006
Teddy told me that in Greek,

551
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:44,605
nostalgia literally means
the pain from an old wound.

552
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,781
It's a twinge in your heart

553
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,290
far more powerful than memory alone.

554
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,559
This device...

555
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,689
isn't a space ship.

556
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,064
It's a time machine.

557
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,073
It goes backwards, forwards.

558
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:22,416
It takes us to a place
where we ache to go again.

559
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,357
It's not called the Wheel.

560
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,159
It's called the Carousel.

561
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,936
It lets us travel the way a child travels.

562
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,138
Around and around
and back home again...

563
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,781
to a place where we know
we are loved.

564
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,183
Good luck at your next meeting.

565
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,190
Don, I have to warn you, I'm not alone.

566
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,730
It was beautiful.

567
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,357
<i>Congratulations, mein Kommandant.</i>

568
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,765
They called from the lobby.

569
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,600
They cancelled their other meetings,
including DDB.

570
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,037
Not just a victory for us.

571
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,266
It's a victory for civilization.

572
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,673
There's also more celebrating.

573
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,678
Mr. Campbell, here,
your father-in-law called.

574
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,611
He'll be in before Christmas.

575
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,547
I've got to get married.

576
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,047
No, thank you. I'm good.

577
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,224
Here's how.

578
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

579
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,796
You know what, Pete?

580
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,530
I've got a way for you
to turn this account into a home run.

581
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,970
He's on a roll.

582
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,438
Clearasil.

583
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,567
You know who buys that?

584
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,406
Young girls.

585
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,640
What a difference it makes in their lives
to be blemish-free.

586
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,546
I believe it does.

587
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:37,018
We have the perfect writer for that.

588
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,588
Peggy Olsen.

589
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,685
That's funny.

590
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:45,228
Freddy Rumsen and I were both
very impressed with her insight.

591
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,193
Freddy Rumsen.

592
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,628
- If I can weigh in...
- No.

593
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,198
Come on. That Belle Jolie thing.

594
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,325
Plus you should have seen her
in that booth yesterday.

595
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,027
She was like Kinsey but with balls.

596
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,728
Stop joking already, will you, Don?

597
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,136
Excuse me?

598
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,732
This is my father-in-law.

599
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,538
He's expecting the very best.

600
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,045
I'm expecting the very best,

601
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,777
not some little girl who'll walk away.

602
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,184
You'll have to give back
that copy of Ayn Rand.

603
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,313
Do you know how hard I worked
to get this account?

604
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,516
Who the hell is she?

605
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,456
Peggy is not even a copywriter.

606
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,618
She's a... a secretary.

607
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,695
Peggy!

608
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,457
Yes, Mr. Draper?

609
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:24,625
Miss Olsen, you are now a junior copywriter.

610
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:29,297
Your first account will be delivering
Clearasil to the spotted masses.

611
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,532
What?

612
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,302
Don't act surprised.

613
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,809
Is this really happening?

614
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,840
Yes, it is.

615
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,647
My goodness.

616
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,821
I will do my sincere best.

617
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,652
Good to hear.

618
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,491
Mr. Campbell, here,
will brief you after the holiday.

619
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,763
Of course.

620
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,462
That'll be all.

621
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,336
Thank you, Mr. Draper.

622
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,847
I said congratulations, didn't I?

623
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,645
Although sometimes when
people get what they want,

624
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,947
they realize how limited
their goals were.

625
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,352
So I guess I'll put you
in with Victor Manning.

626
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,356
David Steuben got fired.

627
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,720
Fired?

628
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,293
People hated his work.

629
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,893
Will I get business cards?

630
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,257
Please make all your
requests through Bridget.

631
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,300
Of course.

632
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,961
Peggy, I know you a little.

633
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,665
Remember, just because
you now have a door,

634
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,969
don't forget that once you didn't.

635
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,840
Think of the other girls,
or they won't think of you.

636
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,705
Vic Manning, I'd like you
to meet Peggy Olsen.

637
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,148
She'll be taking Mr. Steuben's desk.

638
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,651
Nice to meet you.

639
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,288
I don't feel so swell.

640
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,982
I think I should go home.

641
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,959
I have to stop eating off the cart.

642
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,030
If you're trying to find
a way to go out and celebrate,

643
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,597
you should ask your secretary
to cover for you.

644
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,927
Very funny.

645
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,063
Happy Thanksgiving.

646
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,159
You, too, Joan.

647
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,535
David and I had a deal.

648
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,232
No meetings in here, okay?

649
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,399
And no music.

650
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,684
What can we do for you today?

651
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,454
My stomach hurts really bad.

652
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,258
I think I had a bad sandwich.

653
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,229
Let's take a look.

654
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,108
Oh, my God.

655
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,647
Honey, you didn't mention
that you were expecting.

656
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,443
What?

657
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,278
You're going to be a mother.

658
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,317
That's impossible.

659
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,950
You want us to call your husband
or your boyfriend?

660
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,589
I don't understand.

661
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,130
Stop talking.

662
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,096
Now listen, we're going
to get you up to Maternity.

663
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,605
No. No, that's not possible.

664
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,114
Do you feel that?

665
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,688
My God!

666
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,095
We need a wheelchair.

667
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,598
It hurts!

668
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,565
It's going to be okay, all right?

669
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,227
We just want you to calm down.

670
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,235
You don't understand.

671
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,169
We need a wheelchair!

672
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,310
Call Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry.

673
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,381
Oh.

674
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,153
Hello, darling.

675
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,560
Oh, were they having
a party at the office?

676
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,692
Yes.

677
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,237
I think I should...

678
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,772
lie down.

679
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,434
That's a good idea.

680
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,602
Sure. Rest up.

681
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,805
But make sure you're awake later.

682
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,541
Daddy!

683
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,776
Would you like to try to feed him?

684
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,649
Don't you want
to hold him, sweetheart?

685
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,091
Hello?

686
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,031
Don?

687
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,809
What are you doing here?

688
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,277
Daddy! Are you coming with us?

689
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,781
No, he isn't. Daddy has to work.

690
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,749
But you can drive us
to the station.

691
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,217
I haven't called the taxi yet.

692
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,788
I'm coming with you.

693
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,055
Really?

694
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,025
You are?

695
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,652
I'll pack the car.

696
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,355
We'll be there before midnight.

697
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,761
Daddy's coming with you.

698
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:37,771
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

699
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,369
Oh, my goodness.

700
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:51,946
Hello?

701
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,687
Hello.
