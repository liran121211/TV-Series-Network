1
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
running in the house.

2
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,045
Grandpa's here! And Aunt Gloria!

3
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,247
If I leave, can you
keep your mouth shut?

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,155
Elizabeth, are you hiding
your sugar bowl from me?

5
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,925
Gene, I think I have some packets
from Howard Johnson's.

6
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,192
No, no.

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,929
Daddy, have a saccharine or nothing.

8
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,834
Where is your sugar bowl?

9
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,340
Do you want to wake up
with a cold leg like Grandpa Herman?

10
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,139
Diabetics don't live long,
and sometimes they lose their legs.

11
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,240
Grandpa!

12
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,544
Good morning.

13
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,176
Good to see you, Gene.

14
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,255
Don.

15
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,016
This is my friend Gloria.

16
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,557
I heard you might be joining us.

17
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,787
It's good to have another woman around,
give Betty a break.

18
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,328
Oh, I live to serve.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,057
Hey, you heard that, right?

20
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,359
I have a witness.

21
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,095
She's a hell of a sport.

22
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,637
Don, will you help me with the suitcase?

23
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,729
We're only going for the weekend.

24
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,004
I can't get it out of the closet.

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,705
Honestly, it's unseemly.

26
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,280
I can imagine everyone at the club.

27
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,941
"Was she waiting at the funeral
unbuttoning her top button

28
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,882
like for some Sadie Hawkins dance?"

29
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,181
She seems like a perfectly nice lady.

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,985
What am I supposed
to do with this, fill it with hay?

31
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,423
How far do you want to go with this?

32
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,859
Oh, I'll say you talked me out of it.

33
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,397
She's a vulture.

34
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,694
Her husband was a failure.

35
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,328
When he died, they found out
he'd cheated on his income taxes.

36
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,406
And her kids...
Louise never married.

37
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,102
Two more years and she'll be
hanging out at funerals, too.

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,644
Huntley... he was my brother's age.

39
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,974
He was always "funny. "

40
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:32,074
Birdie, your father
was married, what, 40 years?

41
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,586
The man can hardly fix himself a cup of tea,
let alone do laundry.

42
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,553
All he needs is a housekeeper.

43
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,090
A housekeeper goes home at night.

44
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,318
Don.

45
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,087
Let him have it.

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,290
And that fake smile.

47
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,730
You've been looking
forward to the beach.

48
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,960
Let her cook.

49
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,093
Let your father
put some stones by that wall

50
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,798
so we stop getting water
underneath the deck.

51
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,000
I guess I won't have to
worry about talking to her.

52
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,236
She never stops.

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,312
Just get through today.

54
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,904
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

55
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,916
We'll go to that place
with the lobster rolls.

56
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,248
Just come now.

57
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,813
You hate the way I drive...
but my father taught me.

58
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,450
Half the office is cleared out.

59
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,826
<i>It's Kennedy, Kennedy,
Kennedy, Kennedy</i>

60
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,370
<i>Kennedy, Kennedy, Ken-nedy for me</i>

61
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,133
<i>Do you like a man
who has some spritz?</i>

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,141
<i>A man who's always fair</i>

63
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,473
<i>We'll wager him against the others</i>

64
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,638
<i>And when you compare</i>

65
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,578
It looks like a Maypo ad.

66
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,378
It's incredible.

67
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,951
Happy days are here again.

68
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,953
I'm just wild about Harry.

69
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,455
It's light, it's fun,

70
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,357
it doesn't cloud the mind with,
I don't know, issues?

71
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,519
And it's catchy.

72
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,096
It's catchy like it gets in your head

73
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,188
and makes you want
to blow your brains out.

74
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,131
The president is a product, don't forget that.

75
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,773
<i>I would like to talk to you for a moment
about dollars and cents.</i>

76
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,779
<i>Your dollars and cents.</i>

77
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,611
<i>Now, my opponents want to increase
federal expenditures</i>

78
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,186
<i>as much as $18 billion a year.</i>

79
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,778
<i>How will they pay for it?</i>

80
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,652
<i>There are only two ways.</i>

81
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,385
<i>One is to raise your taxes.</i>

82
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,755
Turn it off.

83
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,123
<i>The other...</i>

84
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,129
An ad made by
a public relations team.

85
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,260
Message received and forgotten.

86
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,898
We should give this
to Franz for some music.

87
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,205
Nixon's campaign song in the key of E.

88
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,007
Ethel, go get the ice pick

89
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,216
That Nixon guy is on TV again

90
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,650
Should have never been this close.

91
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,485
I'd say we could run them again,
but I don't think you want to see them.

92
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,559
Oh, I've seen them.

93
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,458
Which reminds me, you people are not
watching enough television.

94
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,360
It is your job. The shows and the ads.

95
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,489
I was just wondering,

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,263
there must be any number of people
harvesting mud on Johnny Kennedy right now.

97
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,564
Have we heard anything?

98
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,139
We hear things. Nothing useful.

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,138
He's a womanizer.

100
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,640
That's not going to hurt him.

101
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,869
Women find out about that,
it'll push him over the top.

102
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,946
Nixon is still ahead in the polls.

103
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,914
Should have never been this close.

104
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,918
Why do we need to attack
when there is a story to tell?

105
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,216
Kennedy: Nouveau riche,

106
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,792
recent immigrant who bought his way
into Harvard.

107
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,589
And now he's well-bred? Great.

108
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,631
Nixon is from nothing.

109
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,860
A self-made man,
the Abe Lincoln of California,

110
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,595
who was Vice President of the United States

111
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,434
six years after getting out of the Navy.

112
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,269
Kennedy? I see a silver spoon.

113
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,004
Nixon? I see myself.

114
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,240
If we were to run a critical ad,
there are obvious benefits.

115
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,976
When you run an ad that's positive,

116
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,745
you're only convincing people
who are already voting for you.

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,012
But when you run an ad that's critical,

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,553
you get a shot
at the people on the fence.

119
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,714
There are a lot of people
on the fence.

120
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,884
Gentlemen, whether the Nixon campaign
wants it or not,

121
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,362
we have to produce a spot
that aims a Howitzer at Kennedy's balls.

122
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,660
I want to hear ideas.

123
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,098
After the long weekend.

124
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,797
I agree. Let's go down swinging.

125
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,275
If we can switch to a conversation
about paying clients,

126
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,538
Menken's is coming in today
to sign off on the roll out.

127
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,805
Father and daughter.

128
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,680
I get the feeling old Abe Schmenken
can kill this whole thing.

129
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,446
Of course, the checks
have cleared already,

130
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,489
but... Don, I want you to go in
and ride bare-back over Paul here.

131
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,990
Done.

132
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,026
And, uh, Don, I want you
on your best behavior.

133
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,031
Excuse me?

134
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,193
I know she bothers you.

135
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,050
Miss Holloway, may I?

136
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,984
I really need to get to the bottom of that.

137
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,387
Yes, I would like to get a look at those.

138
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,065
Margaret and Mona are off
to Block Island for Labor Day.

139
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,166
Gone for the weekend
along with every other wife in town.

140
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,505
We can go anywhere tonight.

141
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,169
We can see a Broadway show,

142
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,545
then sit at any table at The Colony
with our clothes off if we want to.

143
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,914
How about a movie?

144
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,509
<i>Have you seen The Apartment?</i>

145
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,679
I went last week
with Mona and Margaret.

146
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,620
I heard Shirley MacLaine is good.

147
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,691
Oh, please.

148
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,657
A white elevator operator?

149
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,092
And a girl at that?

150
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,925
I want to work at that place.

151
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,623
Oh, I bet you do.

152
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,359
The way those men treated that poor girl,

153
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,436
handing her around
like a tray of canapes.

154
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,970
She tried to commit suicide.

155
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,869
So you saw it, huh?

156
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,543
Ah, Red, that's not how it is.

157
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,542
Look, it was crude.

158
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,340
That's the way pictures are now.

159
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,143
<i>You see that ridiculous Psycho?</i>

160
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,411
Hollywood isn't happy
unless things are extreme.

161
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,453
It didn't seem that extreme to me.

162
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,579
Are we actually going
to get in a fight over a movie?

163
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,456
You know, Mona had a dream once
where I hit the dog with the car.

164
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,529
She was mad at me all day,
and I never hit the dog.

165
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,996
We don't even have a dog.

166
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,763
Why don't I call you later?

167
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,633
Uh, Joannie...

168
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,968
Call me soon,
because we can go anywhere.

169
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,635
The new atrium will make the store
brighter and more vibrant.

170
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,972
The aisles will be wider,

171
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,843
spotlighting these
new chrome display cases.

172
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,939
Over here will be a new restaurant...

173
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,278
An elegant tea room.

174
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,115
Modern classic signs
and champagne linens.

175
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:46,749
A tea room is nice,
but 30% of my ground floor

176
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,589
is devoted to the restaurant business?

177
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,153
Lunch and Shopping: A day of indulgence.
It's what ladies like.

178
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,030
Yes, I saw that in the chapter here.

179
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,433
It's much longer than the little schedule

180
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,907
that says we have to close our doors
while it's getting nailed together.

181
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,136
Three months of construction,

182
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:09,180
during which time
we build enormous anticipation.

183
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,045
Like a movie premier.

184
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,811
The New Menken's.

185
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,012
You will have a line that first day.

186
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,988
Even if you have to pay
people to stand in it.

187
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,182
We'll do whatever it takes.

188
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,489
Mr. Draper, my daughter's presence here

189
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,063
should let you know that
I am not against change.

190
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,359
And let us assume that this is the most

191
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,266
amazing idea in retail
since "buy one get one free. "

192
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,667
I still don't understand

193
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,402
why we have to throw out
the baby with the water.

194
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,707
Can't I keep what I have
and just build on it?

195
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:47,981
Well, honestly, the unpleasant truth
is you don't have anything.

196
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,853
Your customers cannot
be depended on anymore.

197
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,925
Their lives have changed.

198
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,459
They're prosperous.

199
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:00,396
Over the years,
they've developed new tastes.

200
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,694
They're like your daughter:

201
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,203
Educated, sophisticated.

202
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:11,333
They know full well what they deserve,
and they're willing to pay for it.

203
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,505
Why would I want to own a store
that I wouldn't want to shop in?

204
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,482
Mr. Menken, I don't know if that's true.

205
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,042
You had no problem abandoning
that second-floor hosiery store

206
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,951
on 7th Avenue
for your present location.

207
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,253
And that's a story you'll be proud
to tell your grandchildren.

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,261
The only problem is they won't care.

209
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,163
As much as Grandpa
likes that marble palace,

210
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,063
I can promise you, they won't.

211
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,500
They'll look at it and they'll say,

212
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,471
"Grandpa, it must have been hard
back in the olden days. "

213
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,508
And it was.

214
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,408
Everybody's jumping to forget it.

215
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,711
Excuse me, but this is not
some phony story

216
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,183
you people print in your
Fourth of July circulars.

217
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,414
My father actually started with nothing,

218
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,185
and he made it into everything
we're talking about.

219
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,352
Who here can say that?

220
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,191
I meant no disrespect, sir.

221
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,889
None taken.

222
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,595
This is the plan, Daddy.

223
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,898
As you can see,
it wasn't just thrown together.

224
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,496
It does seem very well thought out.

225
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,508
It is.

226
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,407
Pleasure to finally meet you.

227
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,815
I hope you two know
what you're doing.

228
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,287
Looks like we both get to keep our jobs
a little while longer.

229
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,723
Don't screw this up.

230
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,988
I think he likes me.

231
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,623
I guarantee you there is nothing
about you he likes.

232
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,496
What about you?

233
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,039
Daddy, can we?

234
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,901
This place reminds me
of a Czarist Ministry.

235
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,447
No matter what the decision,
you don't feel it was yours.

236
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,678
Fortunately, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

237
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,219
He's very good. Persuasive.

238
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,686
Yes.

239
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,850
A little... dashing for my taste.

240
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,003
Carol, it's 10:30.

241
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,131
Did we have lunch,
because even I can't leave this early.

242
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,106
No, I needed to talk to you.

243
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,940
Why aren't you at work?

244
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,172
Don't tell me you're late again.

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,645
Do you need to see Dr. Emerson?

246
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,239
No. Good grief, Joan.

247
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,248
Then what?

248
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,046
You walked 12 blocks in a heat wave.

249
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,781
And I see you didn't take my advice
about the dress shields.

250
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,585
You know how Mr. Aldridge
has had me reading the slush pile?

251
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,184
Yes, writing the rejection letters.

252
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,320
You told me. It was depressing.

253
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,298
I'm so stupid!

254
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,528
This morning
in the submissions meeting,

255
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,936
the editorial director
asks why we haven't responded

256
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,531
to this poet from Yale, Marlon Rice.

257
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,806
Mr. Aldridge tells him we never saw it.

258
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,179
The the director asks me,
and I cover for Mr. Aldridge.

259
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,481
I said that I had read it and rejected it.

260
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,556
Then they made Mr. Aldridge fire me.

261
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,147
Oh, honey, that's awful.

262
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,886
He was really sorry about it.

263
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,554
- Of course. That SOB.
- I know.

264
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,826
I'm going to have to ask
my dad for more money again.

265
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,094
- It's humiliating.
- Stop it.

266
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,137
You shouldn't be embarrassed.
There's never enough money.

267
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,706
You always seem to manage.

268
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,797
These men.

269
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,002
We're constantly building them up.

270
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,373
And for what?

271
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,003
Dinner, jewelry.

272
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,672
Who cares?

273
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,613
We need to go out
and shake all this gloominess.

274
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,483
All I want to do is sit
in the movies and cry.

275
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,055
No movies.

276
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,386
Let's look for some actual bachelors.

277
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,050
Empty their wallets.

278
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,525
I hate Manhattan sometimes.

279
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,493
Don't say that.

280
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,565
This city is everything.

281
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,565
Where's Howdy Dowdy at?

282
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,106
What can I do for you?

283
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,699
I just got off the phone with Brett Rowley
at Dr. Scholl's.

284
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,541
Don't tell me they're coming in again
about the exercise sandals.

285
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,739
Did you tell them summer's over?

286
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,409
They're not coming in. Ever.

287
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,507
They're going to Leo Burnett.

288
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,519
What? Why didn't he call me?

289
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,590
Probably because they were
disappointed with the creative.

290
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,249
Rowley called it dull and humorless.

291
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,850
- And what did you say?
- What could I say?

292
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,259
I've never lost an account before.

293
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,331
Especially one that was here before I got here.

294
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,059
So you really put up a fight?

295
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,727
He had very strong feelings.

296
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,394
Said some unpleasant things.

297
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,371
Which you don't remember
or I'm sure you'd tell me.

298
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,637
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them.

299
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,179
Are you going to tell
Sterling or should I?

300
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,552
Unless you think it can wait
until after the weekend.

301
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,386
I'll take care of it.

302
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,130
Were you buzzing me?

303
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,571
My intercom was making
a funny sound.

304
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,136
Leave it.

305
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,473
Do you wear Dr. Scholl's inserts?

306
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,777
I thought we all had to.

307
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,476
Take them out.

308
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,253
Get rid of this, please.

309
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,066
We lost Dr. Scholl's.

310
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,261
Where?

311
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,268
Leo Burnett.

312
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:43,899
Campbell enjoyed telling me
it was something to do with creative.

313
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,033
I thought I should tell you.

314
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,611
Make sure the ink is dry on that raise.

315
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,078
That fat piece of shit.

316
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,739
He's a cigarette ash.

317
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,113
Chicago. What a joke.

318
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,947
Small time.

319
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,318
Sorry, maybe you're from there.

320
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,915
<i>Well, I know I didn't drop the ball on this.</i>

321
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,220
Sales were steady.

322
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,765
It probably didn't help that our billings
crept up for no apparent reason.

323
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:11,029
Eventually, an accountant
is going to read the mail.

324
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,036
If you're trying to cheer me up,
it's working.

325
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,266
The day you sign a client
is the day you start losing them.

326
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,501
You don't really believe that.

327
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,042
You know what my father
used to say?

328
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,840
Being with a client
is like being in a marriage.

329
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,608
Sometimes you get into it
for the wrong reasons

330
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,149
and eventually,
they hit you in the face.

331
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,515
Damn it.

332
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,954
Are we supposed to cry about this?

333
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,992
So we lost an account.

334
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,755
That means we'll just have to cut back.

335
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,193
Let's go fire somebody.

336
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,193
It's Labor Day weekend.

337
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,500
Between now and Monday
we have to fall in love a dozen times.

338
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,040
Betty's at the shore.
I'm headed down tomorrow.

339
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,939
What do we work so hard for?

340
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,274
To have enough money
to buy fabulous vacations

341
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,177
for our families so we can live it up here.

342
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,579
Give me tonight. You owe me that.

343
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,244
I can use you as bait.

344
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,413
There's a casting call at 4:00.

345
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,548
Double-sided aluminum.

346
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,818
If Freddie Rumsen's brain works

347
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,019
the way I think it works,
slow and obvious,

348
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,030
I think we should go down to casting
and see who's on the couch.

349
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,657
Remember, Don,
when God closes a door,

350
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,429
he opens a dress.

351
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,937
What do you have there?
Precious cargo?

352
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,707
Mr. Rumsen has me trafficking
the Belle Jolie pouch.

353
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,873
Aren't you a busy beaver?

354
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,510
Hey, I'm talking to you.

355
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,583
If you want to see the proofs,

356
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,452
you'll have to check with Mr. Cosgrove.

357
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,547
It's his account.

358
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,992
Look at you. Minister of Protocol.

359
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,087
So has Draper talked to Sterling yet?

360
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,529
You'll have to ask him.

361
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,622
I'm asking you.

362
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,100
You should talk to him.

363
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,500
What's wrong with you?

364
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,697
Excuse me?

365
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,776
I'm just trying to do my job
and you're making it very difficult.

366
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,843
Peggy, dear.

367
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,605
I think I understand what this is about.

368
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,442
But you're not being professional right now.

369
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,881
I cannot believe
I am in this conversation.

370
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,953
You think this is easy for me?

371
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,079
I don't know.

372
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,422
I don't know if you like me
or if you don't like me.

373
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,688
I'm just trying to get along here.

374
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:24,395
And every time walk by, I wonder,
are you going to be nice to me?

375
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,165
- Or cruel.
- Cruel?

376
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,433
What am I supposed to say?

377
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,566
I'm married.

378
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,008
Yes, I know.

379
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,809
And I heard all about
how confusing that can be.

380
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,715
Maybe you need me to lay on your couch
to clear that up for you again?

381
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,655
That's some imagination you've got.

382
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,917
Good thing you're a writer now.

383
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,585
What do you need me for?

384
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,264
It's incredible.

385
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,202
I mean, we're just hanging out
in the art department

386
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,671
and you two wander in.

387
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,832
We thought it was casting.

388
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,910
I wish it was.

389
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,501
I'd definitely pick you two.

390
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,911
I mean, you have
such an exquisite look.

391
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,913
The bones of your face.

392
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,951
And your sister, my goodness.

393
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,488
You two look very different
when you pay attention.

394
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,057
I have an older brother.

395
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,854
My neighbors growing up had a dairy,

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,292
and one of the cows
gave birth to two calves

397
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,658
that were attached at the back.

398
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,231
Then they cut them apart,

399
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,324
but they always wanted
to be together.

400
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,925
Is that what happened to you two?

401
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,566
Do you like Ukrainian food?

402
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,506
Let me ask you something, Draper.

403
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,339
Do any of these men
have anything else to do?

404
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,642
Just wanted to make sure
the girls were, you know...

405
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,376
Matching?

406
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,247
Exactly.

407
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,953
Well, there you have it, Draper...

408
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,996
double-sided aluminum
as envisioned by Sterling Cooper.

409
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,333
Look at you.

410
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,906
Roger Sterling.

411
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,441
Eleanor. Eleanor Ames.

412
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,471
What a great God that made two of you.

413
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,315
Oh, what a sweet thing to say.

414
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,817
Um, Mirabelle.

415
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,318
This is Donald Draper.

416
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,820
He's our creative director here.

417
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,289
What a pleasure to meet you.

418
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,225
Well, honestly...

419
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,354
I think we're going to send
everyone else home

420
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,796
and use our authority to say that you two

421
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,926
are the new faces of Cartwright
Double-Sided Aluminum.

422
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,027
Oh, my God. Thank you.

423
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,299
I think this calls for a celebration.

424
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,772
Come on upstairs with us.

425
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,400
One drink could be fun.

426
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,603
One last question.

427
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,203
How many birthdays have you had?

428
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,282
20.

429
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,281
How about her?

430
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,854
You're coming, aren't you, Don?

431
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,534
Aren't you two a pair of bookends.

432
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,199
What do you say, Draper?

433
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,539
Shall we cast them in bronze
and mount them on the credenza?

434
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,873
Oh, my.

435
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,504
Everything he says
means something else, too.

436
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,476
It did get warm in here.

437
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,018
They shut the air off at 5:00.

438
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,180
Oh, Rochester, get her
an extra ice cube or something.

439
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,496
So... Mirabelle,
what's your special talent?

440
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,761
Singing, dancing, baton twirling?

441
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,495
I ride. Mostly dressage.

442
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,868
She has a wall full of blue ribbons
back home in Winchester.

443
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,373
Huh. You know, I have
a few awards myself.

444
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,811
Look at your skin. It's translucent.

445
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,644
That's "see-through. "

446
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,445
Can I touch it?

447
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,882
I don't see why not.

448
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,219
After all, I do work here now.

449
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,692
That tickles.

450
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,324
Soft as a lamb's ear.

451
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,960
Mm, you've got to feel this.

452
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,902
I'm talking to you, Eleanor.

453
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,881
Do you love your sister?

454
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,917
Of course.

455
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,350
Why don't you show her how much?

456
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,716
Give her a kiss.

457
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,585
Right now.

458
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,488
Why do people always ask us that?

459
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,566
My God, because
it's a beautiful thing.

460
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,136
Well... I should be heading home.

461
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,571
<i>Wunderbar. Have a great night.</i>

462
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,540
You know what?
I think we should go, too.

463
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,575
Oh, come on.

464
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,078
Nobody's going anywhere.

465
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,807
Do you want to dance?

466
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,610
That's nice.

467
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,116
Dance for us.

468
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,351
I don't dance.

469
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,487
Sure you do. Look at that.

470
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,830
I feel like I'm stuck
somewhere between Doris Day

471
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,834
<i>in Pillow Talk and Midnight Lace,</i>

472
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,962
when what I need to be is Kim Novak
in just about anything.

473
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,405
You're prettier than Kim Novak.

474
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,737
What a rut.

475
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,937
1960, I am so over you.

476
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,013
Zip?

477
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,584
Shalimar?

478
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,848
Too much?

479
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,050
You never say die, do you?

480
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,218
What's the point?

481
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,427
Oh, Carol, sweetie, it's not that bad.

482
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,297
Tomorrow is another day.

483
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,563
I know.

484
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,968
I'm okay, actually.

485
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,039
Good.

486
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,131
No waterworks. Mascara.

487
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,301
I'm just so happy right now.

488
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,208
Okay, are you on the Gilbey's already?

489
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,646
No. I just love this, you know?

490
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,240
Being with you.

491
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,081
We do know how to have fun, don't we?

492
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,453
Joan...

493
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,384
I love you.

494
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,259
I really do.

495
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,558
You.

496
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,000
That first week in college,

497
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,471
I saw you walking on the commons,

498
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:41,672
and I thought, "Who is she?"

499
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:47,407
Then college was over
and you came here...

500
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,713
and I followed you.

501
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,187
You needed a roommate.

502
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,055
I moved in.

503
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,691
Just to be near you.

504
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,769
I did everything I could to be near you.

505
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,169
All with the hope

506
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:13,575
that one day... you would notice me.

507
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,050
Joannie...

508
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,747
just think of me as a boy.

509
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,858
You've had a hard day.

510
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,461
Let's go out and try
to forget about it, okay?

511
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,536
Of course.

512
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:50,308
Good, because I'm starving.

513
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,657
They seem to be having a lot of fun.

514
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,413
Do you have any gum?

515
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,984
No. No, I don't.

516
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,289
Listen, I should get going.

517
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,987
Over to the left there. There ya go.

518
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,723
Don't make me use my spurs on ya.

519
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,264
Easy.

520
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,334
Right over there by the trough.

521
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,742
I really should go.

522
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,548
Eleanor.

523
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,519
I'll be right outside.

524
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,283
Let her go.

525
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,787
Listen... let me call you a car.

526
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,527
I should wait for my sister.

527
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,163
I mean, I've been around
the block a few times,

528
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,070
but her...

529
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,201
Now all you're thinking about
is going around the block, huh?

530
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,408
I don't even think I can
get out of the driveway.

531
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,681
Please, just wait with me?

532
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,754
I like your office. It's really fancy.

533
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,388
Mirabelle. Love that name.

534
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,996
Listen to that.

535
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,161
I haven't heard Margaret laugh
since she was 7.

536
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,863
Who's Margaret?

537
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,498
My daughter.

538
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,510
Yeah, I think I like Mirabelle
better than Margaret.

539
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,342
I wanted to name her
Margaux, like the wine.

540
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,177
Lost that battle.

541
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:10,118
I'm sure she would have hated Margaux
almost as much as she hates Margaret.

542
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,951
Why is she so angry?

543
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,787
You're only a little older than her.

544
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:15,985
You're not angry.

545
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,390
Don't be sad.

546
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,093
I just wish I could talk to her
without her rolling her eyes.

547
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,694
Of course, she's right.

548
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,103
I have nothing to say to her.

549
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,266
I'm sure that's not so.

550
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,401
Girls love their fathers.

551
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,173
You have such beautiful skin.

552
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,442
My God, I just want to eat it.

553
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,245
I want to suck your blood like Dracula.

554
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,805
Aren't you two the sweetest
for walking us up?

555
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,507
You should be roommates.

556
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,710
He seems to be a delightful young man.

557
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,719
Ralph, you don't teach at Fordham also?

558
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,982
No, we were just sitting
next to each other at the bar.

559
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,990
And it seemed to be working.

560
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,322
Carol, you know what we need? Ice.

561
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,591
Now where is that gin hiding?

562
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,895
Just so we're clear about what's what...
the redhead is mine.

563
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,595
So, Franklin, you're into language.

564
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,831
Yes, well, it's kind of a hobby of mine.

565
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,271
I do carpentry. I'm building a dry sink.

566
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,740
I love language.

567
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,778
Words and their ways.

568
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,075
Well, this is just bad speech.

569
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,740
I collect it.

570
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,785
There's this Polish janitor
in our building.

571
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,321
His name is Stash or Stanislaus.

572
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,256
He's locked me out of my office
on more than one occasion.

573
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,266
One time, he described his bride
as "not speaking real good English. "

574
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,933
I cherish that gift.

575
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,303
Put that in a book and sell it.

576
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,467
Well, this is a party, isn't it?

577
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,510
I was wondering if I could
impose on the professor

578
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,107
for one more teeny favor.

579
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,586
I never say "no" to a beautiful girl.

580
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,589
The light fixture in my room is out.

581
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,818
Could you change it for me?

582
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,122
I'm up to that task.

583
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,327
We don't have a lot of men around here.

584
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:42,603
Oh, it's not that dark.

585
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,913
Well... what are we going to do?

586
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,324
Whatever you want.

587
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,157
You're married, aren't you?

588
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,429
Yes. Yes, I am.

589
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,596
Yeah, you kiss like a married man.

590
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,140
Your own way, no talking you out of it.

591
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,073
Is that good or bad?

592
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,305
Oh, it's good.

593
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,076
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

594
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:33,613
Maybe it's this office,
but... you are selling too hard.

595
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,793
Eleanor! Hello?

596
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,955
Ellie, where are you? Something's wrong!

597
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,503
Your friend... Something's wrong.

598
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,970
I knew I shouldn't have asked him
to do it a second time.

599
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,735
Jesus.

600
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,438
L... I feel like
there's a tank on my chest.

601
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,746
Just call an ambulance, and then leave.

602
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,318
Is he okay?

603
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,246
Leave.

604
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,515
Right there!

605
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,430
Mirabelle...

606
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,235
Oh, Mirabelle.

607
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,208
Mona.

608
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,080
Your wife's name is Mona.

609
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,813
How you doing?

610
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,418
All these years I thought
it would be the ulcer.

611
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,495
I did everything they told me.

612
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,896
Drank the cream, ate the butter,

613
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,992
then I get hit with a coronary.

614
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,733
Son of a bitch, it hurts.

615
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,813
Well, you're talking. That's good.

616
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,177
That's not what the doctors think.

617
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,682
Don...

618
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,120
do you believe in energy?

619
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,248
What do you mean?

620
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,660
Like the thing that
gives you get up and go?

621
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,460
No.

622
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,626
Like a human energy.

623
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,997
I don't know, a...

624
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,904
A soul?

625
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,107
What do you want to hear?

626
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,249
Jesus.

627
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,517
I've been living the last 20 years
like I'm on shore leave.

628
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,886
What the hell is that about?

629
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,721
It's living.

630
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,089
Just like you said.

631
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,057
God.

632
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,235
I wish I was going somewhere.

633
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,382
He's doing great.

634
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,075
Mona.

635
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,819
I love you so much, Mona.

636
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,260
Oh, God, I love you so much.

637
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,161
I know. Sweetheart, I know.

638
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:19,649
Listen to me, darling.

639
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,843
Margaret is outside.

640
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,318
- She needs to see you.
- No. No. No.

641
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,889
I can't let her see me like this.

642
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,392
Roger...

643
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,523
I'm getting her.

644
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,600
My goodness.

645
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:15,297
All this from selling toilet paper.

646
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,408
Mr. Cooper, where is everyone?

647
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,739
My roommate just
gave me the message.

648
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,971
Out.

649
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,808
It's the middle of the night.

650
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,576
I'm not leaving you here.

651
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,378
You should go.

652
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,918
Thank you.

653
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,880
Suit yourself.

654
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,224
Miss Holloway, Roger Sterling
has suffered a heart attack.

655
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,422
What?

656
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,365
He survived it, and is currently
being hospitalized.

657
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,266
Now we need to immediately
send a telegram

658
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,271
to every one of our clients

659
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,604
assuring them that business will not
be interrupted.

660
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,836
Of course.

661
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,437
This is the master client list...
names, addresses.

662
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:03,748
I'll read them out and you compose
the telegram, huh?

663
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,585
Carl McElroy.

664
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,718
President, Alpine Real Estate.

665
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,532
It's me, Bets.

666
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,830
Were you sleeping?

667
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,302
<i>Not really.</i>

668
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,203
The kids are in bed with me.

669
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,209
Gloria and my father
made such a big deal

670
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,905
about having separate bedrooms.

671
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,608
Listen, Roger had a heart attack.

672
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,743
What?

673
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:36,911
Don, that's terrible.

674
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,216
<i>Is he going to be okay?</i>

675
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,486
The doctors basically
say they don't know.

676
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,458
Mona's with him.

677
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,223
<i>She must be a wreck.</i>

678
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,798
It's good that you're there.

679
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,335
<i>- About tomorrow...
- No, I understand.</i>

680
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,132
Well, what happened?

681
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,300
He was at work.

682
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,071
He just keeled over.

683
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,669
<i>It was awful, actually.</i>

684
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,339
If the kids wouldn't be so heartbroken,

685
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,280
I'd come home now.

686
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,285
I don't want to be here.

687
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,756
You should have seen the two of them
in the kitchen tonight.

688
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,260
She was making some
pot roast with ketchup

689
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:22,890
<i>and my father started hovering
behind her, watching,</i>

690
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,128
<i>like he used to with my mother.</i>

691
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,762
How can he pretend
that she never existed?

692
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,637
I still pick up the phone sometimes to call her.

693
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,471
<i>I don't know, Bets.</i>

694
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,772
I know people say life goes on,

695
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,183
and it does.

696
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,619
But no one tells you
that's not a good thing.

697
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,284
<i>Why is that?</i>

698
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,851
I don't know.

699
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,090
Stop thinking about that.

700
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,963
I can't.

701
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,593
I try.

702
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,600
<i>Do you want me to come up there?</i>

703
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,870
No. There's nothing you can do.

704
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,040
<i>Okay. Give Mona my love.</i>

705
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,344
<i>And, Don...</i>

706
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,615
make sure you eat something.

707
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,788
How's he doing?

708
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:25,827
Not great.

709
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,329
What happened?

710
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,567
I don't know.

711
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,433
<i>Every Republican politician
wants you to believe</i>

712
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,269
<i>that Richard Nixon is, quote, experienced.</i>

713
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,708
<i>They even want you to believe
that he has actually</i>

714
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,711
<i>been making decisions
in the White House.</i>

715
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,281
<i>But listen to the man
who should know better:</i>

716
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,374
<i>The President of the United States...</i>

717
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,282
<i>I just wondered if you
could give us an example</i>

718
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:54,552
<i>of a major idea of his that you had adopted
in that role as the decider.</i>

719
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,387
<i>If you give me a week,
I might think of one.</i>

720
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,756
<i>I don't remember.</i>

721
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,831
<i>At the same press conference,
President Eisenhower said:</i>

722
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,866
<i>No one can make
a decision except me.</i>

723
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,095
<i>For real leadership in the '60s,</i>

724
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,468
<i>help elect Senator
John F. Kennedy president.</i>

725
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,881
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

726
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,820
I got the telegram.

727
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,886
Let me in.

728
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,156
Are you okay?

729
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,062
No.

730
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,640
You look terrible.

731
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,971
Can I get a drink?

732
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,476
Of course.

733
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,379
Are you happy with the doctors?

734
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,754
I can have my father make a call.

735
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,054
I don't know. He's rich.

736
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,153
They seem to be taking care of him.

737
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,027
Is he okay?

738
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,533
You can tell me.
I'm not moving the account.

739
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,573
He's gray and weak.

740
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,578
His skin looks like paper.

741
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,981
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,952
He's your friend, isn't he?

743
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,317
What's the difference?

744
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,482
You don't want to lose him.

745
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,157
Don, don't.

746
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,630
What good is that going to do?

747
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,463
Is this, like, some solar eclipse?

748
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,367
The end of the world?
Just do whatever you want?

749
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,337
- I don't know.
- You do.

750
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,965
You're exhausted.

751
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,543
You need to sleep, that's all.

752
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,238
I just need to sit down.

753
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,720
Sit with me.

754
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:06,790
Why?

755
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,519
Because I feel like you're looking
right through me over there.

756
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,686
I'm not.

757
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,801
I don't like feeling like this.

758
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,845
No one does.

759
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:38,245
I remember the first time
I was a pall bearer.

760
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,790
I'd seen dead bodies before.

761
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,360
I must have been 15. My aunt.

762
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,955
I remember thinking...

763
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,058
They're letting me carry the box.

764
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,103
They're letting me be this close to it.

765
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:58,470
No one is hiding
anything from me now.

766
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:03,878
And I looked over,
and I saw all the old people

767
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,178
waiting together by the grave.

768
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,411
I remember thinking, I've...

769
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,723
I've just moved up a notch.

770
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,393
I've never heard you
talk that much before.

771
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,398
- Rachel...
- What do you want from me?

772
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,732
You know. I know you do.

773
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
You know everything about me.

774
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,606
I don't.

775
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,708
You don't want to do this.

776
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,750
You have a wife. You should go to her.

777
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,785
Jesus, Rachel.

778
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,116
This is it.

779
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,248
This is all there is,
and I feel like it's slipping

780
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,089
through my fingers
like a handful of sand.

781
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,123
This is it.

782
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,325
This is all there is.

783
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:02,167
That's just an excuse for bad behavior.

784
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,672
You don't really believe that.

785
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,187
No.

786
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,598
Not unless you tell me you want this.

787
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,567
Yes, please.

788
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:03,766
Miss Holloway, I know
it's none of my business,

789
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,768
but you could do a lot better.

790
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,394
He's just a friend.

791
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,065
That's not what I'm
talking about, my dear.

792
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,702
Don't waste your youth on age.

793
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,748
Could you? Lobby.

794
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,236
Do you want one?

795
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,202
No.

796
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,311
You told me
your mother died in childbirth.

797
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,082
Mine did, too.

798
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,087
She was a prostitute.

799
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,030
I don't know what my father paid her,

800
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,229
but when she died, they...

801
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,637
brought me to him and his wife.

802
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:25,242
And when I was 10 years old, he died.

803
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:32,951
He was a drunk
who got kicked in the face by a horse.

804
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:41,558
She buried him and took up
with some other man, and...

805
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:49,428
I was raised
by those two sorry people.
