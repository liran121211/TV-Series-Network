1
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,873
Listen, can you mail this for me today?

2
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,741
Sure, Whitman.

3
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,043
It's going to be at least 40 cents.

4
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,555
Thank you.

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,718
Mama, Mrs. Winter is a busybody.

6
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,554
You're threatening me.

7
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,586
I'm glad he wants to see me,

8
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,359
but I... I don't want to see him.

9
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,561
I'm working a lot right now.
I don't have a lot of time.

10
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,637
I have to go.

11
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,142
Were you listening to my phone call?

12
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,508
You mean your personal phone call?

13
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,782
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

14
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,908
Peggy, will you get me
a glass of ice water?

15
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,849
Someone hasn't told
the sun it's October.

16
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,615
- Miss Holloway.
- Mr. Draper,

17
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,155
it's the Clients' Luncheon.

18
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,781
Mr. Cooper said
you were responsible

19
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,553
while Mr. Sterling is out.

20
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,288
Didn't you handle most of Mr. Sterling's
catering questions?

21
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,590
Continue doing that.

22
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,188
How is he? Have you visited?

23
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,166
I have. He's less sickly.

24
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,330
I hope he knows
how concerned we all are.

25
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,442
- Good morning, chief.
- Don.

26
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,737
Joan's been a bitch lately.

27
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,178
Anyone else notice that?

28
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,214
Oh, absolutely.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,840
- I like it.
- Oh, do you?

30
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,723
This got kicked over
from Ed Baltz at Compton.

31
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,557
We sent them Firestone last month
because of our conflict with Goodyear.

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,392
This is how they repaid the favor.

33
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,760
Look at that.

34
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,959
I think it's a modified Lionel transformer.

35
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,094
Well, I never thought I'd say this,
but what does the research say?

36
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,366
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.

37
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,500
No, it isn't. It's "before"
and "after" pictures

38
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,373
since the dawn of time.

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,710
Mr. Martin Buckwald, its inventor,
he calls it the P.E.R.,

40
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,783
or Passive Exercise Regime.

41
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,648
So it needs a name.

42
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,256
The Electrocizer.

43
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,953
For a slimmer, better you.

44
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,620
That helps a little.

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,129
Regarding slimmer,

46
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,200
Buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials,

47
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,168
but unfortunately
none you can take a picture of.

48
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,135
We tried to get our own testimonials.

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,173
Some of the fellas brought
it home to their wives.

50
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,332
And?

51
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,967
It's tricky. I, uh, gave it to Jennifer.

52
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,443
She took it the wrong way.

53
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,036
She told me to wear it.

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,244
Violet has it.

55
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,319
She says the scales are the same,

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,878
but she hasn't given up on it
like she does with diets after a week.

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,890
Mitch and some of the other guys...

58
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,482
We had eight belts.

59
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,459
Again, there's been no weight loss yet.

60
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,961
Who cares if it works?

61
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,395
They're offering us
commission on media,

62
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,262
plus a bounty on every unit
upside of last year's comps.

63
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,165
But fake weight loss claims?

64
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,609
Thank you.

65
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,943
What about her?

66
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,748
She's obviously losing
some kind of battle.

67
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,483
You may have to let it out a little.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,422
Maybe you should
put her on your regimen

69
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,051
of sprinting out the door
every day at 5 to 5.

70
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,427
What I'm saying is she did
a heck of a job on Belle Jolie.

71
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,466
Maybe lightning will strike twice.

72
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,900
I don't think Peggy's the answer.

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,536
I promised Buckwald
we'd go with our big guns.

74
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,236
Our big guns have been silent.

75
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,333
Peggy!

76
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,776
Did you need more water?

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,584
This device is a new product.

78
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,555
I would like you
to give us your thoughts on it.

79
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,421
Right now?

80
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,493
No.

81
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,662
It's a weight loss belt, it says.

82
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:03,668
It, uh, stimulates the muscles,
imitating calisthenics.

83
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,362
You'd be perfect for it.

84
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,462
Why?

85
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,666
Because you're a woman.

86
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,040
And we'd like your point of view.

87
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,713
I'm getting another account?

88
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,978
It's an assignment, not an account.

89
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,619
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Take it for a spin.

90
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,662
Uh, am I allowed to change the name?

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,499
Yes.

92
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

93
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,504
That'll be all.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,609
I need 3.59 for the phone bill.

95
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,341
I told you I never use it.

96
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,782
But you do use the saltines
and the Velveeta and the liverwurst.

97
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,045
I never even got any.

98
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,051
I had some people over

99
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,554
while you were out drinking on Tuesday.

100
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,023
3.59. That's your half of the phone.

101
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,821
You should use it more.

102
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,657
I have work to do.

103
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,391
I don't know why you do that.

104
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,126
When I leave the office, I'm done.

105
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,202
Do you have to go home?

106
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,006
No.

107
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,172
Good. I don't want you to.

108
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,881
I don't want to.

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,293
This is hard for me.

110
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,731
Mostly because I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you.

111
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,130
I don't think about it.

112
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean, I try not to.

113
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:34,342
Must be a powerful mind you have there,
because I can't control mine.

114
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,550
I keep thinking about us being together.

115
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,881
We are together.

116
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,785
I know, but...

117
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,222
I don't know if I understand
how this works,

118
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,059
where it goes.

119
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm worried it's a fantasy.

120
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,368
It's not.

121
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:07,070
I told you, I'm right
where I'm supposed to be.

122
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,284
I just haven't figured out
what to do yet.

123
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,306
I'm sorry. Would you
like me to wait outside?

124
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,607
It's up to you.

125
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,172
I, um, I did the work
on the weight loss belt,

126
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,376
like you asked.

127
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,543
That was fast.

128
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,621
You asked me to.

129
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,952
And what is your unique point of view?

130
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,083
I wrote it down.

131
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,394
Summarize.

132
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,090
It's one day. I don't know
if I lost any weight.

133
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,564
Do you feel different?

134
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,761
I wrote it down.

135
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,005
Peggy, you're saying
even less in here than you are now.

136
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,646
It's hard to put into words.

137
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,719
Then you have failed.

138
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,049
You definitely feel something

139
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,355
that I think some women...
would like to feel.

140
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,821
Where is that here?

141
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,626
It vibrates.

142
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,002
And that coincides
with how you wear it.

143
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh. I see that here:

144
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,516
"A sensation. "

145
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,948
Yes.

146
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,350
It explains its success.

147
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,183
And it basically made me think

148
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,884
it was probably...
unrelated to weight loss.

149
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,188
We now have a benefit.

150
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,354
And we just have to figure out
how to put it into words.

151
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,795
Have another go at it.

152
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,628
I will work on that, Mr. Draper.

153
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,572
Peggy, just think about it deeply.

154
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,266
Then forget it,

155
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,744
and an idea will... jump up in your face.

156
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,081
Thank you.

157
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,919
Excuse me, ma'am.

158
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,325
I hate to bother you.

159
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,421
I'm from the Frederick
Air Conditioning Company,

160
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,124
and I'd like to talk to you

161
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,360
about an opportunity
to live in frozen comfort.

162
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,164
I'm not interested.

163
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,001
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?

164
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,200
It's a scorcher out here.

165
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,510
L...

166
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,705
Of course.

167
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,305
Thank you.

168
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,039
Thank you.

169
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:33,312
You know, we have many units
in all price ranges.

170
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,613
What?

171
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,821
I'm married to a salesman.

172
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,587
And I'm sure my husband and I
can brave another week

173
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,220
or however long
this Indian summer's going to be.

174
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,492
Can I come back when he is here?

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,434
I mean, a unit here
or in your living room...

176
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,368
We wouldn't
even have to alter your window.

177
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,531
We could just cut a hole right above it.

178
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,700
You see this gap?

179
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,370
That's where your cool air,
whatever there is of it,

180
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,707
is escaping.

181
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,304
From that little space?

182
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,112
Yes. And there's a science
to how heat patterns work.

183
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,450
Now, what you need is
a unit here downstairs

184
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,716
and one in your bedroom.

185
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,021
That's if you have the right construction.

186
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,561
That would be nice.

187
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,154
I could take down some numbers,

188
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,699
you know, measure everything.

189
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,735
Write up an estimate...

190
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,633
something you could
discuss with your husband

191
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,467
when he comes home.

192
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,939
I guess that would be okay.

193
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,255
You know...

194
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,989
my husband...

195
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,565
I think he would rather go to Sears.

196
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,732
If that's what you want.

197
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,566
You should go.

198
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,665
I can just guess what this would cost
and put it on your door for your husband.

199
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,141
Please go.

200
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,693
Fernando, we are pleased to hear
that case sales have more than doubled.

201
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,767
We still believe that most of the credit
goes to your rum.

202
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,836
Say hello from me.

203
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,531
Bert Cooper says it is a unique pleasure
working with you.

204
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,373
I just finished trying
to talk Lucky Strike off a ledge.

205
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,775
Junior or Senior?

206
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,711
Senior. He's coming for lunch tomorrow

207
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,249
to see if Roger is still involved.

208
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,717
And they're having this lunch
bedside, I suppose?

209
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,914
I invited him here to see for himself.

210
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,890
He called my bluff.

211
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,359
Clear tomorrow.

212
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,953
I need you to, uh,

213
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,532
draw focus from our guest of honor.

214
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,404
...was number 2 in his class
at Columbia Law School.

215
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,098
He works with Morgenthau,

216
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,700
and having been captivated by him
at more than one cocktail party,

217
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,210
he is a charmer.

218
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,144
I can see he does something for you,

219
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,546
but I don't know if this is the right time.

220
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,676
Because you're getting
so much younger every day?

221
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,277
Because I don't know
if my heart would be in it.

222
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,085
Are you seeing that goy?

223
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,520
A little bit.

224
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,995
Well, I told you
I wouldn't let that stop me.

225
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,157
What if he were, um...

226
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,996
You're mumbling.

227
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,872
What if he were married?

228
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,464
My goodness.

229
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,201
Jesus.

230
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,371
Nothing's happened.

231
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,708
Good.

232
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,475
But I have been thinking about it.

233
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,713
The two of us together.

234
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,816
It feels so natural. I feel so close to him.

235
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,588
Really?

236
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,062
He's married, but I don't think he's happy.

237
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,655
Obviously.

238
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,131
What does it matter?
Nothing's going to happen.

239
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,137
All I know is what I see in the movies.

240
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,970
It's magical, and then they start talking
about him leaving his wife,

241
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,510
and then he doesn't.

242
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,806
I saw this one where the husband
gets the woman pregnant

243
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,074
so he kills her.

244
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,706
You don't want to be that woman.

245
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,518
Go ahead.

246
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,022
Oh, please. Whatever it says
is going to seem related to this.

247
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,224
"You are your own worst enemy. "

248
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,924
That's yours.

249
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,845
You look tired.

250
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,611
I am.

251
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,247
You're working too much.

252
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,519
No, it's just...

253
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,487
Maybe.

254
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,767
It's too hot in here anyway.

255
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,810
You know, we're losing a lot of our cool air
through the windows in the dining room?

256
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,888
What?

257
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,824
Nothing. It's just something
the salesman said.

258
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,954
What was he doing
in the dining room?

259
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,760
What are you talking about?

260
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,370
You let a stranger in my house?

261
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,495
Don't raise your voice.

262
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,368
I damn well will raise my voice.

263
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,669
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

264
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,142
I could have bought an air conditioner.

265
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,872
It's hot.

266
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,710
Salesmen go into people's
homes every day.

267
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,218
It's like when you
turn on a television set

268
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,447
and then you turn it off, it...

269
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,387
Look, you didn't want
to spend the money...

270
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,788
Good night, Betty.

271
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,013
I feel like I should make a speech.

272
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,307
Get back to work.

273
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,448
Welcome back. You look good.

274
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,387
Honey.

275
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,790
One hour. That's all you get.

276
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,792
You be a good boy.

277
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,834
I shall be both dog and pony.

278
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,903
Come on.

279
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,707
He looks like death.

280
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,837
I know. His hair and his skin
are the same color.

281
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,539
Not really.

282
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,752
That's the spot...
exactly where it happened.

283
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,586
I can still feel it.

284
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,570
Miss Holloway, we brought you here
because of your discretion.

285
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,869
Can you help us with this? His color?

286
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,434
Hey, honey.

287
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,941
Well, you know,
we don't need Miami Beach,

288
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,949
but, uh, just do what you can do.

289
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,725
Can I kiss you?

290
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,299
I don't know if I could handle it.

291
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:23,411
We should have done this
for Nixon before the debates.

292
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,956
Oh, the arrogance of that campaign.

293
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,958
It's infuriating.

294
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,891
Being the incumbent is even harder.

295
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,589
You can't just sit on your ass
and look presidential.

296
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,131
You probably shouldn't get so upset.

297
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,860
It's not good for you.

298
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,368
I missed you.

299
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,903
You know that, right?

300
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,071
I missed you, too.

301
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:48,135
Oh, Joannie, Joannie,
look at that mouth.

302
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,812
You're not doing my lips.

303
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,942
My rouge is too dark,

304
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,680
but I have this light lipstick.

305
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,723
You'll draw freckles on me, too,
like Raggedy Andy?

306
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,829
Look, I want to tell you something

307
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,694
because you're very dear to me,

308
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,097
and I hope you understand
it comes from the bottom

309
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,103
of my... damaged, damaged heart.

310
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,713
You are the finest piece of ass I ever had,

311
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,782
and I don't care who knows it.

312
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,375
I am so glad I got to roam those hillsides.

313
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,454
Stop it.

314
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,181
I mean it.

315
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,689
I've had a lot of time

316
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,420
to think about the things I've done
and been sorry about,

317
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,496
and being with you is not one of them.

318
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,161
Oh, Red.

319
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,001
That's not what I wanted.

320
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,010
You look better.

321
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,762
I should have come over.

322
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,632
That's a silly idea.

323
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,000
Damn it.

324
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,542
Soon the milk stains
are going to meet the sweat stains.

325
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,872
Should we get out of here and let her sleep?

326
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,917
I'd love to, but the door's
noisier than our talking.

327
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,544
She's actually
a good sleeper, thank God,

328
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,021
even with the heat rash.

329
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,523
Poor thing.

330
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,321
And it actually gets hotter at night.

331
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,896
Did you think about
buying an air conditioner

332
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,522
from that pushy young man yesterday?

333
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,101
Is that what he was selling?

334
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,163
He looked like one
of Carlton's squash buddies.

335
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,174
Made me sorry I answered the door.

336
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,836
He was very pushy.

337
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,074
He came in and started measuring things.

338
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,150
Don was not happy about that.

339
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,218
Don was there?

340
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,581
No.

341
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,559
Carlton would break my arm.

342
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,795
It was foolish letting him in.

343
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,630
Why would you tell him?

344
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,373
It just came up.

345
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,973
I wasn't thinking.

346
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,380
What did he do?

347
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,042
What do you think?

348
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,950
He lost his temper.

349
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,848
He's very protective.

350
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,093
Just as you requested,
a little of our local color:

351
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,464
Pastrami, cole slaw, sour pickles.

352
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,968
I like it.

353
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,595
It's Yankee barbecue.

354
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,372
Yeah.

355
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,313
They're all ours.

356
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,750
Here they are now.

357
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,320
- Roger.
- Hello, Lee.

358
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,252
- Hello, Don.
- Lee.

359
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,757
Jimmy, Preston, how do you do?

360
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,655
It's wonderful to see you.

361
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,287
Well, from what I hear,

362
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,593
you boys had all but
given me up for dead.

363
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,792
I don't think it's wrong

364
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,268
for us to express our concern
for your well-being.

365
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:37,603
Well, I know how much
you love your delicatessen.

366
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,940
But I know
there's also something else

367
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,638
you want to discuss.

368
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,181
You're worried about losing the lawsuit?

369
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,080
There were no damages.

370
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,447
But we lost.

371
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,645
But there were no damages.

372
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,348
Blame is one thing, malice is another.

373
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:56,257
I worked my way inside
and out of the FTC.

374
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,990
Bought a lot of dinners in Washington.

375
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,827
You can't fight them.

376
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,833
That's what lawyers are for.

377
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,871
Lawyers? I've seen
a girl fight harder on her first date

378
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,941
than these DC shuttlecocks.

379
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,303
Listen, I'm a stockholder,

380
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,846
so I called Chester Conrad
in the Surgeon General's office,

381
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,382
and he assured me it would
be at least three years

382
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,746
before they could compile a report.

383
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,820
But legislation is in progress.

384
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,752
We hear another year or two beyond that.

385
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,381
They speculate they're going to put
warning signs on the packages.

386
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,256
There's still plenty of time
before we have to worry about that,

387
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,388
during which we wait
to see if share drops off

388
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,296
before we run for the hills
looking for a new campaign.

389
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,794
Is that true?

390
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,737
Well, it must be. He just said it.

391
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,766
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with my wife.

392
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,471
I'm glad we came by.

393
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,948
I missed you all.

394
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,780
You New Yorkers.

395
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,955
To New Yorkers.

396
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,354
May they always...

397
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,157
Oh, Jesus. Not again.

398
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,560
Are you okay?

399
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,963
Just give him some air.
Give him some air.

400
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,227
Give him air.

401
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,868
- I'm okay.
- Don't talk.

402
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,445
This was stupid. I'll get the elevator.

403
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,810
No, they're holding the elevator.

404
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,483
I'm very sorry.

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,826
Mona, sweetheart, this was a mistake.

406
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,922
I tried to talk him
out of it, but you people.

407
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,627
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.

408
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,900
I used to think you couldn't
put a value on a human life,

409
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,134
but I never asked Bert Cooper, did I?

410
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,368
Sweetheart...

411
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,876
Go to hell, Bert.

412
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,885
I don't need to tell you that Don
has everything under control.

413
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,754
I don't know.

414
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,656
Without Sterling...

415
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,626
I may have a family business,

416
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,527
but I'm not an autocrat.

417
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,896
I have a board,

418
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:21,200
and my son wants to be the executive
of an aluminum company.

419
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:27,040
Ah, still, your board
should give credit where credit is due.

420
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,840
Share?

421
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,973
We all like Don Draper,

422
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,052
but if I was you,
I'd find some way to show him

423
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,986
that you all do, too.

424
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,353
He's a dead man, you know,
even if he survives.

425
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,550
What are you talking about?

426
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,151
Most clients will put up
with one coronary from a partner.

427
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,025
Cost of doing business. Two?

428
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,723
Are we going down?

429
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,699
I wrote, prepared,
and sent out my resume this afternoon,

430
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,736
at company expense.

431
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,601
Look, it doesn't take a genius
to see what's going to happen.

432
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,004
They'll bump Draper up to partner.

433
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,200
Everyone will fall in line.

434
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,435
Draper.

435
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,375
It would have happened a long time ago

436
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,571
if they weren't so greedy.

437
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,239
They're already paying him
his weight in gold.

438
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,907
Half the accounts
at this agency came for Draper.

439
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,383
Frank Birmingham brings in
a lot of accounts.

440
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,317
Come on. You sit
in that conference room.

441
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,684
Frank Birmingham brings them in,

442
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,314
and while they're dozing off,

443
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,790
Don goes through their wallets.

444
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,350
What about Mitch Sullivan in Media?

445
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,953
He's fat, bald, and charmless.

446
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,863
You think Draper likes me?

447
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,696
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.

448
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,236
It's hard to tell with him.

449
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,361
He likes you.

450
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,598
I work at it.

451
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,799
I work at it, too.

452
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,000
I can tell you do.

453
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,667
You never know when he's doing it.

454
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,770
There's not a man in this room

455
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,711
who's not holding Don Draper
on their shoulders

456
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,249
so that he can reach partner.

457
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,375
He's not going to fire you.

458
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,919
Who said anything about that?

459
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,420
No one. It's just...

460
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,547
You don't think he deserves it, do you?

461
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,627
Campbell, don't you
know anything about business,

462
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,286
cleaning out the old guys?

463
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,830
It's good for us. It opens up spots.

464
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,265
My ma, she wouldn't shut up about you.

465
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,099
I told her I remembered you.

466
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,140
Isn't that nice?

467
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,608
You smoke.

468
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,804
All the time.

469
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,905
It's practically mandatory in our office.

470
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,314
Thank you.

471
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:27,196
<i>Brandy Alexander for La Donna,
and a Rheingold.</i>

472
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,363
What, you don't like it? I'll send it back.

473
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,532
Well, my friend Joan
always orders them for me.

474
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,303
They're usually sweeter.

475
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,379
She's a scream.

476
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,916
She lives in the city.

477
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,053
There's a bar in Manhattan
where the glasses are chilled.

478
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,827
What's in that?

479
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,293
I don't know.

480
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,862
So you drive a truck.

481
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,165
Yes.

482
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,241
But I bought my own route.

483
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,500
Wise potato chips.

484
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,134
Really?

485
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,610
Yeah.

486
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,876
I have an area that's just mine.

487
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,976
The route was expensive,
but the hard part was learning that truck.

488
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,782
Special license.

489
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,550
We have a potato chip account:

490
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,750
Utz.

491
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,793
You get free ones? I do.

492
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,987
I don't know. I don't like potato chips.

493
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,089
You live out here, right?

494
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,998
Prospect Park.
I have my own apartment.

495
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,935
Well, I share it
with my roommate Marjorie.

496
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,666
She's a character.

497
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,346
My sister's a secretary
for Bulova in Flushing.

498
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,815
I just got a new account the other day.

499
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,515
I already wrote copy
for Belle Jolie lipsticks.

500
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,683
It's going to be in a bunch of magazines.

501
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,919
Which ones?

502
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,358
I don't think you read them.

503
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,656
They're about high fashion.

504
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,630
Advertising doesn't work on me.

505
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,966
It's just a lot of people screaming at you
from the walls and the TV.

506
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,973
If advertising is good,
people never think it works.

507
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,406
How do they know it does?

508
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,942
Did they ever prove that?

509
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,643
Why are you insulting what I do?

510
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,844
"So you drive a truck. "

511
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,846
You do.

512
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,649
I'm my own boss, you know?

513
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,054
You get off the train
every day at Grand Central,

514
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,489
and they spray you with gold?

515
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,654
Let me tell you,
you can act like you're from Manhattan,

516
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,062
but you don't look like those girls.

517
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,600
Hey, hold on.

518
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,508
That wasn't nice.

519
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,807
I feel sorry for you.

520
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,212
I said I'm sorry.

521
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,013
Those people? In Manhattan?

522
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,785
They are better than us,

523
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,486
because they want things
they haven't seen.

524
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,732
<i>The Danny Thomas Show</i>

525
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:20,429
<i>was brought to you
tonight by Post cereals.</i>

526
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,666
<i>All fine products of General Foods.</i>

527
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,333
<i>Post cereals.</i>

528
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,308
<i>And now...</i>

529
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,146
I'll be up.
I want to check on Roger.

530
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,947
Okay.

531
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,656
<i>Hello.</i>

532
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,255
Hello. It's Don Draper.

533
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,301
What can I do for you?

534
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,336
I don't know
what you do for anybody.

535
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,906
Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.

536
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,304
<i>After hundreds of dollars,</i>

537
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,377
all you've managed to do
is make her more unhappy.

538
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,709
I understand this is frustrating for you.

539
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,409
This has nothing to do with me. It's her.

540
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,815
You took a woman
with a bad case of nerves,

541
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,218
and you made her weaker, not stronger.

542
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,386
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

543
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,361
All I can say is that it's a process,
and time is part of it.

544
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,795
If you'd like to expedite things,

545
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,388
we can put her in psychoanalysis.

546
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,797
What are you doing now?

547
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,926
<i>Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.</i>

548
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:30,940
<i>Psychoanalysis would mean a minimum
of three sessions a week and optimally five.</i>

549
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,234
Thank you.

550
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,210
I'll think about that.

551
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,889
Over there.

552
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,393
There's no chair.

553
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,529
I really wish I could have
come in and prepared first.

554
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,608
Sorry. This is the way it works.

555
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,267
Of course.

556
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,612
I only have one and a carbon.

557
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,116
That's all I had time to do.
You'll have to share.

558
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,186
Come on. Just give it to one of the girls.

559
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,020
Ready when you are.

560
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,531
Women lose weight so they'll
feel good about themselves:

561
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,662
Healthier, more attractive.

562
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,239
Rejuvenate has a Latin root

563
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,503
which literally means "the return of youth. "

564
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,740
The Rejuvenator
gives you the flush and glow

565
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,874
not only that you might have
after hours of exercise

566
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,384
but certainly as a young girl.

567
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:54,390
Isn't it nice to feel that way
whenever you want?

568
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,960
Combined with a sensible diet,

569
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,052
The Rejuvenator.

570
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,654
You'll love the way it makes you feel.

571
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,433
Look, I'm not going to wait
to see how Don lands on this.

572
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,099
I'm going to tell you it's good.

573
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,678
Nice end run around the weight loss.

574
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,646
I think it's good, too.
But what does it do?

575
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,353
From what I understand,

576
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:29,187
it provides the pleasure of a man
without the man.

577
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,588
We've been replaced?

578
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,063
That's why Mitch's wife
didn't want to take it off.

579
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,397
Oh, I'd love to see her in that.

580
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,233
Oof, she's already so hot to trot.

581
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,398
4th of July, that gingham halter

582
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,839
with the knot at the bottom?

583
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,273
She was falling out of it.

584
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,776
Jayne Mansfield.

585
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,342
Mitch's wife is very attractive.

586
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,883
Oh, I... I don't know her.

587
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,078
First of all, no Latin.

588
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,882
You sound like a valedictorian.

589
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,253
And the name still isn't right.

590
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,193
Lastly, you still might need to give us
a hint at what it does.

591
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,956
I could be more explicit.

592
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:13,332
I was thinking of calling it stimulating.

593
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,200
I think you need, like, a code word,

594
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,173
uh, like... I don't know.

595
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,573
Like refreshing.

596
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,372
I'll think about that.

597
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,039
Oh, my God. Freddie,
doesn't your wife have one?

598
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,343
What's your point, Ken?

599
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,010
My point is, didn't you say she loved it?

600
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,747
That's funny.

601
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,786
Freddie, Sal,
you know what to do here.

603
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,260
I'll get arrested just doing the layouts.

604
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,323
Now...

605
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,060
that wasn't so bad.

606
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,237
Looks like everybody liked it.

607
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,937
I can tell.

608
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,449
Uh, Freddie's wife does not look like Mitch's,

609
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,211
you know.

610
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,445
Good work, Pegs.

611
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,683
Come in.

612
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,621
Mr. Draper, I don't want to seem ungrateful,

613
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,998
but I think I could serve Sterling Cooper
and you better as a copywriter

614
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,400
if I had my own desk.

615
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,096
You have a desk.

616
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,072
But now I have radio spots.

617
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:11,114
Peggy, the conversation of a raise
is not inappropriate at this moment,

618
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,682
but do not be timid.

619
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,514
You presented like a man.
Now act like one.

620
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,680
I want $5.00 a week more.

621
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,315
Jesus, what do you make?

622
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,587
$35 a week.

623
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,789
Well, that's a 15% kick.

624
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,193
Don, a word.

625
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,871
Cooper and Draper just
went into Sterling's office.

626
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,449
Tell me when they
come out of there, will you?

627
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,451
Sure. I'll just sit here and watch the door.

628
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,884
That's all I'll do.

629
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,819
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

630
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,564
Is he dead?

631
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,134
No. Quite the opposite.

632
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,295
They let him go home to convalesce.

633
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,997
And?

634
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,333
I want to make you a partner.

635
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,782
As a symbolic gesture,
I think telling me that in here is in bad taste.

636
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,444
That's the way it works.
Roger knows that.

637
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,748
I'm not adding your name
to the masthead.

638
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,722
I'm restoring faith to our clients.

639
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,123
I accept.

640
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,956
I'll start you at 12%

641
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,893
and see how both you and Roger do.

642
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,932
Of course you'll remain creative director,

643
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:40,094
and to fill the position
of head of account services,

644
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,002
you are the only member
of the blue ribbon committee.

645
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,735
Do I hire from inside or outside?

646
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:50,143
I just made you partner.
Do I have to do everything?

647
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,010
No contract.

648
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,817
Of course you'd say that.

649
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,652
Beware the nonconformist.

650
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:08,364
I'm going to introduce you
to Miss Ayn Rand.

651
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,400
I think she'll salivate.

652
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,209
Is he dead?

653
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:28,707
No.

654
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,411
So when's he coming back?

655
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,049
You know, I think this office
is too big for me.

656
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,924
I might need it if I'm going
to lure in Marty Brennen

657
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,223
as head of account services.

658
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,300
Then it's true. Congratulations.

659
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,197
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

660
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,534
You know I admire your work.

661
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,162
I believe you.

662
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,968
I hope you do.

663
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,841
And I don't think it can be denied
that we make a very good team.

664
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,540
You know what?

665
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,647
I do like this office.

666
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,812
I think Roger would want me to have it.

667
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,186
That way he'll always know
he can have it back.

668
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,556
I hope you're aware that I'd love
to throw my hat in the ring.

669
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,892
I am now.

670
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,946
Peggy, we have both had very good days.

671
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,915
You may leave your post.

672
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,351
It's 4:30.

673
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,786
I'm sorry. That's the best
I can do at this point.

674
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,222
I have work to do.

675
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,860
You can have your raise.

676
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,727
And I'll talk to Miss Holloway
about getting somebody on your desk

677
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,493
while you attend to your assignment.

678
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,367
Can I tell her?

679
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,869
Sure.

680
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,236
In the meantime, go with your friends.

681
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,467
Celebrate.

682
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,908
Good night, Mr. Draper.

683
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,219
Good night.

684
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,310
Mr. Draper?

685
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,145
Good night.

686
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,814
Back away from the set.

687
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,716
Come on. You'll burn your eyes out.

688
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,413
Hi, Daddy.

689
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,116
Uh, I would have made you dinner,

690
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,423
but I called the office,
and no one answered.

691
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,054
Should I fix something?

692
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,690
No. I was supposed to have
a meeting with a client,

693
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,166
but it got cancelled.

694
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,376
I got made partner.

695
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,746
Oh, my God. Don, that's wonderful.

696
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,290
Don, you were right
about letting people in the house.

697
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,860
I'm so sorry.

698
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,156
I don't want to talk about that.

699
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,939
The heat's supposed to break tomorrow.

700
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,947
It'll probably be snowing in two weeks.
