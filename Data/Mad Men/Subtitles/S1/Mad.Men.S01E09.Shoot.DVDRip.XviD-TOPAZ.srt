1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,955
Mommy, look at that!

2
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,555
Hello.

3
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,632
Don Draper. How are you?

4
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:44,066
<i>Probably about like you:
Enduring the splendor of Fiorellol</i>

5
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,628
You know we got
that Israeli tourism thing, right?

6
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,332
Mazel tov.

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,468
I ran into Jim Jordan from BBDO
at the Athletic Club

8
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,208
with, uh, Frank from Y&R.

9
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,307
Your name came up.

10
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,579
Three millionaires
in towels in a steam room.

11
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,416
I don't know how to take that.

12
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,114
Take it as a compliment,

13
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,387
a sign that you're
destined for greater things.

14
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,759
I think "Jesus Over Rio"
was the best tourist campaign

15
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,354
I've seen in over 20 years.

16
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,456
Wasn't good enough
to land the Israelis.

17
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,761
Ah, that's not you.

18
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,497
That's the tiny store you work in.

19
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,540
Now, if you were with me at McCann,

20
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,939
you'd have over 500 people
at your disposal...

21
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,806
and that's just in New York.

22
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,743
We can get a lot of things done.

23
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,543
Can you get me out
of the second half of this show?

24
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,142
All I'm saying is you've done your time
in the farm leagues.

25
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,518
Yankee Stadium is on the line.

26
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,591
I changed my mind.

27
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,091
I decided you deserve a visit to the bar.

28
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,321
Adele, this is Donald Draper.

29
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,557
If we're being introduced,
I assume that you're in advertising.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,896
Would you both like
to talk about that some more?

31
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,900
Betty.

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,129
My wife.

33
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,261
Jim and Adele Hobart.

34
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,465
Hello. Betty Draper.

35
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,563
A pleasure.

36
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,609
Your husband here was about to prove

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,679
that he can speak about things
other than advertising.

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,509
Oh, he's very interesting.

39
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,708
Well, then, come with me.

40
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,284
Let's get those drinks.

41
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,444
We'll be back.

42
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,612
Champagne?

43
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,930
Besides getting the handsome prince,
are you an actress or something?

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,233
No, I'm a housewife.

45
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:31,242
I did do some modeling...
a lifetime ago.

46
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,107
I'm not surprised.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,511
That is some face you've got there.

48
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,914
Anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?

49
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,713
They used to.

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,755
You know what?

51
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,290
Coca-Cola's deep into this, uh,

52
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,088
international campaign right now.

53
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,358
A European face like yours,
like Grace Kelly's,

54
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,797
might be a road we could go down.

55
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,029
Uh, we could put a call out
for a Grace Kelly type,

56
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,732
but, uh, I don't think we'd come this close.

57
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,706
You say you've modeled?

58
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,471
I'm retired.

59
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,239
This is silly.

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,441
Think about it.

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,542
Your coloring with a green bottle
and an Irish setter...

62
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, drink up.

63
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,484
It's back to Tammany Hall.

64
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,025
I like the show.

65
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,526
Very gay songs.

66
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,493
Well, we'd better get back in there or leave.

67
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,567
Come on.

68
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,432
Uh, it was very nice
meeting both of you.

69
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,885
Why didn't you want
to go to dinner with Jim and Adele?

70
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,657
People like Jim Hobart
always talk business

71
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,825
because they have
nothing else to say.

72
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,336
I can see that.

73
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,996
You know, he gave me his card.

74
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,403
Really?

75
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,942
Did he tell you to put it
under my pillow of something?

76
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:16,004
No. Actually, he was talking to me
about modeling.

77
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,582
Was he?

78
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,911
I don't think it was like that.

79
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,424
He said something about Grace Kelly
and Coca-Cola.

80
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,897
Well, then, there's no need
to doubt his interest, then.

81
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,933
I did model, Don.

82
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,798
Am I that wrong for Coca-Cola?

83
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,776
You're not wrong for anything.

84
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,139
So are you going to go there?

85
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,360
<i>How was Fiorello exclamation point?</i>

86
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:07,161
Lt'll be six months before I can get Don
back into a Broadway theater.

87
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,968
Oh, we ran into this agency head.

88
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,063
Apparently he's courting Don.

89
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,835
He gave me his card.

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,002
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling.

91
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,842
That's a heck of a line.
What did Don say?

92
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,382
He basically said the man was trying
to sleep with one of us

93
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,714
and that he didn't like the idea of either.

94
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,790
I did do some modeling, you know.

95
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,155
I did not know, but I'm not surprised.

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,558
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.

97
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,722
I was a model when I met Don.

98
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,493
A model in Manhattan?

99
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,693
Yes.

100
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,861
It was exciting.

101
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,565
But when I got started...

102
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,005
the summer after college, in Italy.

103
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,201
Italy?

104
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,179
There was this Italian designer: Giovanni.

105
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,307
He wanted to be called Johnny.

106
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,386
That's how much he loved Americans.

107
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,647
Well, he loved American girls.

108
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,521
It was more of an artist/muse relationship.

109
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,594
Okay.

110
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,168
So... he made you all this,
and it was platonic?

111
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,367
No petting, nothing?

112
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,740
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

113
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,611
And put my hair up like this.

114
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,856
And Salvatore said he has
the Menken's artwork,

115
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,323
and to meet him in the art department

116
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,121
because you're going
to need a red pencil.

117
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,752
Any other good news?

118
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,492
I think the mail boy
dropped that off for you last night.

119
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,125
Peggy, can you get me
an outside line?

120
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,922
<i>Right away.</i>

121
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,586
Don Draper.

122
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,165
Now, why would you
call me out of the blue?

123
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,530
I appreciate the gesture.

124
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,036
It's not a gesture, Don,
it's an overture.

125
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,164
Let me tell you, you're
a hard man to run into.

126
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,674
I don't know what to say.

127
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,004
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

128
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,238
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.

129
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,507
The Algonquin?

130
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,378
<i>There's a small hotel.</i>

131
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,212
<i>Isn't that the song?</i>

132
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,887
I don't know. I'm...

133
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,480
I'm not ready to wave the flag just yet.

134
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,650
What about the details?

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,296
I'd rather do this face-to-face.

136
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,025
But you already know
what you're going to say.

137
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,404
I don't have to tell you

138
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,168
the obvious limitations of Sterling Cooper.

139
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,766
But you're going to.

140
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,435
<i>Do I need to be careful here?</i>

141
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,570
<i>It's a mom-and-pop.</i>

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,808
McCann Erickson
is an international company.

143
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,784
We have a network that extends
far beyond Madison Avenue:

144
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,650
<i>Europe, South America.</i>

145
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,589
<i>We're publicly traded.
We issue dividends.</i>

146
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,886
Small is bad.

147
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:21,925
<i>Don,</i>

148
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,588
do you know the kind
of clients we attract?

149
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,096
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,

150
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,222
<i>Esso.</i>

151
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,664
<i>Can you imagine the lifestyle</i>

152
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,565
that goes with handling Pan Am?

153
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,365
It's a panty-dropper.

154
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,699
<i>Television?</i>

155
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,535
<i>You could be in that in a bigger way.</i>

156
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,630
<i>You know that.</i>

157
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,039
<i>What, you want to sell corn?</i>

158
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,441
<i>We do a show about Indians.</i>

159
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,343
Imagine yourself
in a three-year contract.

160
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,315
35 per annum, security set in stone.

161
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,511
<i>Sterling probably hasn't
let you break 30 yet.</i>

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,451
No comment.

163
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,853
<i>I really don't like
doing this over the phone.</i>

164
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,689
All I can say is
eventually you come up here,

165
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,729
or you die wondering.

166
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,667
He gave me his card right in front of Don.

167
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,402
Well, not right in front of him, I guess.

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,138
Well, I told Don about it.

169
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,616
I was a model, you know?

170
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,246
In fact, I met Don on a photo shoot.

171
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,759
I was wearing this Russian blue fox coat.

172
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,096
He was just a copywriter at the fur company.

173
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,597
I remember

174
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,795
he saw that I didn't like
giving the coat back.

175
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,929
It's always the hardest part.

176
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,639
He asked me out.

177
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,476
He wasn't shy. I liked that.

178
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,709
I said no.

179
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,284
Then three weeks later,

180
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,286
the coat arrived at my apartment.

181
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,450
Who knows what kind
of Indian trading

182
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,219
he had to do to get it?

183
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:06,424
I think I only had
two more jobs, maybe three,

184
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,727
before we got engaged.

185
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,500
And then I got pregnant.

186
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,733
It's always a nightmare
raising children in Manhattan,

187
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,073
so we moved to Ossining.

188
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,375
Suddenly I...

189
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,351
really felt so old.

190
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,922
Tell me more about that.

191
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,619
My mother was very concerned
about looks and weight.

192
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,988
And I've always eaten a lot.

193
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,365
And I like hot dogs.

194
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,840
Mother used to say,
"You're going to get stout. "

195
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:58,474
And then I became a model,
and she hated it,

196
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,247
even though Suzy Parker
made $100,000 that year.

197
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,257
My mother hated it.

198
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,349
Manhattan.

199
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,128
She called me a prostitute.

200
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,259
You're angry at your mother.

201
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,530
What?

202
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,163
Are you going to talk now?

203
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,265
You are angry at your mother.

204
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,209
Of all the things I've said in here.

205
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,747
You're sitting up.

206
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,376
You don't listen to me.

207
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,147
You don't listen to what I say,

208
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,222
and then out of nowhere you provoke me.

209
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,653
Tell me more about that.

210
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,901
I miss her.

211
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,237
I understand that.

212
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,742
It's good and bad.

213
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,049
She wanted me to be beautiful
so I could find a man.

214
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,851
There's nothing wrong with that.

215
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,361
But then what?

216
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:28,133
Just sit and... smoke and...

217
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,902
let it go till you're in a box?

218
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,049
I don't care why he gave me his card.

219
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,638
Where'd you get this?

220
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,841
Kurt Teasdale over at Gil Bascom.

221
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,009
It's already on the air.

222
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,551
They wanted to do it
before she had the baby.

223
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,178
Am I alone? I don't understand it.

224
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,348
Because it's in Spanish.

225
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,892
I recognize that finishing school voice.

226
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,087
You can't govern and listen to that all day.

227
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,164
I'm happy to give up
any Spanish speakers

228
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,698
and hope this goes away.

229
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,200
Cooper thinks if Kennedy creeps up
any more in the polls,

230
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,428
Nixon will panic,

231
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,834
and they'll get desperate for our efforts.

232
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,166
He wants everything in place.

233
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,831
More risk.

234
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,637
Why are we doing this again?
And out of pocket?

235
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,144
I for one don't question
the wishes of our clients.

236
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,612
Clients come and go, Campbell.

237
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,809
Sometimes it's best to rid them
of unrealistic expectations.

238
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,079
Are you trying to say that we can't win?

239
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,087
Nixon's got an 8-point lead in the polls.

240
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,247
Not much.

241
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,052
And we still haven't figured out a way

242
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,092
to make an impact about
the Nixon campaign's involvement.

243
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,560
My marching orders
were undecided states.

244
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,688
I think a plan of attack
would make Coop happy.

245
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,130
The 50/50s: Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois.

246
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,532
Now, it's easy to just say that, isn't it?

247
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,901
I think women will hate her.

248
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,372
It's like their better-looking sister
marries a handsome senator,

249
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,500
and she's going to live in the White House.

250
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,100
<i>I'm practically jealous.</i>

251
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,413
Hi.

252
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,785
I called.

253
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,416
I assumed you were staying in the city.

254
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,960
The girl.

255
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,759
We gave her a little extra work,
and now she's distracted.

256
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,959
Look at that.

257
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,528
It's raw, Don.

258
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,744
Don, I realized something today.

259
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,313
I miss modeling.

260
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,476
You were always
telling me you hated it.

261
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,348
Maybe the passing of time

262
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,786
has made me... feel differently.

263
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,619
Maybe it's Jim Hobart.

264
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,421
So what?

265
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,053
It's still an opportunity.

266
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,825
You want to go back to work?

267
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,127
A few days. I mean, is that so bad?

268
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,758
I get paid.

269
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,360
I can get Ethel to watch the kids.

270
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,702
She watches them half the time now.

271
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,606
That's three-, four-hour stretches.

272
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,670
I think it would be fun
to go in and be that girl again.

273
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,147
You're serious?

274
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,650
There will still be ham.

275
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,517
I promise.

276
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,754
Are you resolved?

277
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,555
Or is this even worth arguing?

278
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,961
No, it's not like that.

279
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:44,161
It's just... something I'd like to do.

280
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,437
Well, I can't stop you
from doing what you want to do.

281
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,024
You have no idea
how boring it is around here.

282
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:14,031
Really? I would think one hour
on the Sterling Cooper switchboard

283
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,225
would be a Russian novel.

284
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,801
They told me it would happen,

285
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,393
but the truth is
you really just stop listening.

286
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,995
And put ice on your wrists.

287
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,076
Peggy, do you need to go home?

288
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,309
What?

289
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,476
The sweater.

290
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,450
Are you having one of those days?

291
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,521
It's not that.

292
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,680
I'd like to go home,

293
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,223
but I just don't think I can.

294
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,791
Then what is it?

295
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,520
You're not helping your silhouette.

296
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,661
I ripped my skirt.

297
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,960
You don't have a needle and thread?

298
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,558
It's a big rip.

299
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,571
Oh, honey, I've got
a spare outfit squirreled away.

300
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,970
You can borrow it.

301
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,553
We're not exactly dressed
for that, are we?

302
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,919
I've lost men like you before.

303
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,221
It usually had to do with
my unexpressed confidence.

304
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,386
I think you're one in a million, Draper.

305
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,262
Those are nice clubs.

306
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,301
That bonus from Cooper
must have made you happy.

307
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,133
It was designed as a kind of an armor
against men like Jim Hobart.

308
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,668
How'd you hear about it?

309
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,077
I saw those clubs
going down the hallway.

310
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,174
I thought they were for me.

311
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,310
They're from Jim Hobart.

312
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,023
What did he offer?

313
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,388
Bigger.

314
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,021
The world, basically.

315
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,963
Well, it can't just be
a number on a salary,

316
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,864
because you know we're open to that.

317
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,664
Pan Am.

318
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,436
Pan Am... is not McCann Erickson.

319
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,206
Big talent attracts big clients.

320
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,576
We can try and make
that happen here.

321
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,239
- That's true.
- But don't be fooled.

322
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,147
You hear Pan Am,
you imagine London,

323
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,083
holed up at the Dorchester
with three stewardesses.

324
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,588
The truth is it's more like
a 20-hour boomerang flight

325
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,749
so you can make
a coupon sing in Spanish.

326
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,362
And when you have stockholders
like McCann does,

327
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,398
you can't fire clients.
I know you'll hate that.

328
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,771
I thought about leaving once.

329
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,139
But you know?

330
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,642
It's daunting.

331
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,737
Why entertain the prospect of failure?

332
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,247
That's a sad thought.

333
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,443
No. It made me look at this place.

334
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,282
I don't want to sound sentimental,

335
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,583
but it's not just accounts.

336
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,750
Look around here at what you have.

337
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,263
You want to start over?

338
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,498
I haven't made up my mind.

339
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,436
I'm taking this very personally.

340
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,011
Why? It's business.

341
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,876
Is it?

342
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,888
McCann Erickson is the major leagues.

343
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,388
Good. Let him go.

344
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,458
You're right. Maybe he'll take me with him.

345
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,322
Can you imagine the money?

346
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,589
I heard he's making 30 already.

347
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,961
He's not ten times better than me.

348
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,992
You love him.

349
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,660
Everybody loves him.

350
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,533
Sure. His moods and the way he talks.

351
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,903
I don't even know what he's
saying half the time.

352
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,566
Clients do.

353
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,986
I'll admit she crossed my mind once.

354
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,817
She's having a very bad
freshman year.

355
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,324
They went nuts for her writing.

356
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,825
Belle Jolie, she did that.

357
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,418
Belle Jolie was okay.

358
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,521
She obviously let it go to her head...
and other parts of her.

359
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,498
No, I don't think it's the job.

360
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,466
I think we're seeing the real her:

361
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,164
One of those girls
who slimmed down before she got here.

362
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,140
Now she's here, and there she is.

363
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,573
Who thinks about her?

364
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,508
Maybe she'll go with Draper, too.

365
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,273
It's a tragedy.

366
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:27,080
Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.

367
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,914
And no one ever got to eat it.

368
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,354
Well, I got some work to do.

369
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:37,417
Suddenly upon news of others' success,
a young man is filled with ambition.

370
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,053
Drop dead.

371
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,860
Harry, you busy?

372
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,944
Well, hello. I can't believe this.

373
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,784
I'm sorry. I, uh, overdid it.

374
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,883
You're out of the business
a few years, and things change.

375
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,054
Please, I'm overwhelmed
with the style of you.

376
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,098
Betty Draper, meet Ronnie Gittridge.

377
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,133
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.

378
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,792
He's also my brother-in-law.

379
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,234
It is a pleasure.

380
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,203
Look at her. What did I say?

381
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,671
You ready to work?

382
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,742
I'm excited.

383
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,310
It's not that complicated.

384
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,675
He's either going to tell you
to think about something else

385
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,179
or just stand there.

386
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,513
Jim thinks everyone else's job is easy.

387
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,812
Shall we?

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,285
Mrs. Draper,

389
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,322
it's just a tryout.

390
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,685
No guarantees.

391
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,316
I told you I've done this before.

392
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,124
Now, where did you get that dress?

393
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,223
So basically,

394
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,925
whereas Secor previously
spent their money

395
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,434
on local print and radio,

396
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,697
we increase the network buy to 30%.

397
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,204
More points for each dollar.

398
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,071
Secor laxatives.

399
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,337
You know, I have to talk
to those people.

400
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,844
They're not what you would expect.

401
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,110
They have absolutely
no sense of humor about their product.

402
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,380
Who knew that college
was going to get me out of the army

403
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,045
and into laxatives?

404
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,350
College was the moment, wasn't it?

405
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,790
Fun and games... and girls.

406
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,452
Were you in a frat?

407
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,723
Alpha Delta Phi.

408
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,232
Also known as cutups.

409
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,701
We were the cutups.

410
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,535
We had this stray Dalmatian.

411
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,506
Our mascot Mamie.

412
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,907
So it died,

413
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,946
and in classic fraternity manner,
we decided to throw a party.

414
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,674
Mamie's funeral.

415
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,911
One of the pledges pipes in
that our rivals, Psi U...

416
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,112
They are so gung-ho.

417
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,849
Psi U is throwing a beauty pageant parade
on Main Street

418
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,618
with the girls' school down the road.

419
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,956
Now, my friend Chip...
he's a lawyer now...

420
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,928
says "Why don't we go down there
and get a permit,

421
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,694
throw a grand funeral for Mamie,
and let the girls run away crying?"

422
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,897
That's great. Did you do it?

423
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,975
We had police barricades
and 30 brothers following that pledge,

424
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,566
who had the honor of pulling
Mamie in a Radio Flyer.

425
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,578
That's beautiful.

426
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,978
Idiots.

427
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,310
Wait a minute.

428
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,750
Nixon and Kennedy
are both buying up air time

429
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,089
in these undecided states.

430
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,594
It's an arms race.

431
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,256
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.

432
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,026
So if we can't increase
Nixon's presence,

433
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,396
we can decrease Kennedy's.

434
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,901
How do we do that?

435
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,530
We make big buys in New Jersey,
Illinois, and wherever

436
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,574
for Secor laxatives.

437
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,167
Well, hold on.

438
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,008
So Nixon's selling laxatives?

439
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,605
No. We're selling laxatives.

440
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,275
Nixon's selling Nixon.

441
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,286
And Kennedy's
watching Mamie's funeral.

442
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,185
This is scary.

443
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,252
It is.

444
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,193
Isn't it?

445
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,759
<i>Even careful mothers can't completely</i>

446
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,028
<i>protect their families
from household germs</i>

447
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,397
<i>just by cleaning alone.</i>

448
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,165
<i>That's why you need Lysol.</i>

449
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,103
<i>Lysol, added to your
regular cleaning water,</i>

450
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,868
<i>eliminates germs that cause odors</i>

451
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,603
<i>that may cause illness.</i>

452
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,542
<i>Lysol: Fastest, easiest,</i>

453
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,307
<i>most effective way
to kill household germs...</i>

454
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,438
It was for me.

455
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,847
<i>...and lingering odors.</i>

456
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,919
Who was it?

457
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,683
I'm the girl. The girl with the cola.

458
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,121
It's only a couple days' work.

459
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,823
You know, just a couple of photo shoots
and then some kind of testing.

460
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,400
But I guess you know how it works.

461
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,230
I do.

462
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,533
Don't worry.
I'm not going to ruin this.

463
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,303
I'm very happy for you.

464
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,592
I know you don't like it.

465
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,230
But I know you're
a little bit proud of me.

466
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,242
Come upstairs.

467
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,372
No.

468
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,782
Right here.

469
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,117
Okay.

470
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,817
How are these open already?

471
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,653
Well, Betty, we don't want life
to look difficult, now do we?

472
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,262
You're too much.

473
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:36,785
No! No!

474
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,423
Polly, no!

475
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,718
Let it go.

476
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,658
If I see that dog in my yard again,

477
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,928
I'm going to shoot it.

478
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,218
I see you got there and back in one piece.

479
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,946
Yes.

480
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,682
And even though I got lost,

481
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,519
I sent Ethel home at 4.

482
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,724
They went to the park,
then to visit Ernie at Francine's.

483
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,128
All in all, everyone had a nice day.

484
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,462
So how was it?

485
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,626
There was this man Ronnie.

486
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,533
I don't even know what his job is.

487
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,607
Ronnie Gittridge.
He's the art director. I've met him.

488
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,335
He is such a character.

489
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,468
He tells funny stories.

490
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,603
I brought the form home.

491
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,875
I thought you could
help me fill it out

492
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,745
so I can get paid.

493
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,318
I'd love to.

494
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,732
Sweetie pie.

495
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,065
What happened?

496
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,366
I had a bad dream.

497
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,503
Get in bed with Daddy.

498
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,242
What was your dream?

499
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,652
I don't want anyone to shoot Polly.

500
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,125
No one is going to do that, honey.

501
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,320
Yes. Mr. Brestwood said he would

502
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,398
because Polly ate one of his doves.

503
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,990
They're pigeons.

504
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,535
And he said this to you in your dream?

505
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,765
No, he said it today
when Polly ate the birdie.

506
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,207
She wasn't hurt that bad.
She could fly.

507
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,045
No one is going to hurt Polly.

508
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,418
Good night, honey.

509
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,034
Now they can't play in the yard?

510
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,496
I'm going to get my robe on

511
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,598
and go over there
and find out what happened.

512
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,903
2 in the morning.

513
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,605
He's our neighbor. You'll make it worse.

514
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,204
I'll talk to him.

515
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,376
You should have Ethel talk to him.

516
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,716
Don, they play in the yard
when I'm here, too.

517
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,084
And she didn't tell you?

518
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm sure they didn't tell her.

519
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,995
They probably wouldn't
have told me, either.

520
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,923
There'll be over at Francine's
for the next shoot anyway.

521
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,467
It's one day.

522
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,604
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

523
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,734
Maybe not.

524
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,946
She'd never slept well.

525
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,015
That's not true.

526
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,917
Did you see those big tears?

527
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,121
I really want to get a picture
of her crying one day.

528
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,732
I have to say, Don,

529
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,566
Lucky Strike, even in this lawsuit,
is stronger than ever.

530
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,469
It was a brilliant campaign,

531
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:20,032
like some supersonic jet
flying right over the market.

532
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,345
I was there.
Great work.

533
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,479
Thank you.

534
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,683
Sorry to interrupt.
Who is responsible?

535
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,190
We've made a significant commitment

536
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,992
for as-yet unproduced
Secor laxative commercials.

537
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,498
This didn't go by me.

538
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,535
No, it went by Bob Wilkins
in Media, right to me.

539
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,628
Who is responsible?

540
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,103
Mr. Cooper, sir, it was me.

541
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,338
You thought of this?

542
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,380
Well, uh...

543
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,848
I bear some of the responsibility as well.

544
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,248
What did they do?

545
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:06,517
Every commercial block on air
in the Land of Lincoln

546
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,924
is clogged up with laxative buys.

547
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,692
And a little bit of Nixon time.

548
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,532
The Kennedy people won't know
what to do with themselves.

549
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:24,597
They're going to have
to put his pretty face on the radio.

550
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,404
And with that accent.

551
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,944
Nicely done.

552
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,879
I didn't think you had it in you,
and I mean that.

553
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,574
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

554
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,175
Inspired.

555
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,855
Congratulations, boys.

556
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,159
Peggy, you want to write that down?

557
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,491
Don said congratulations.

558
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,490
Are we done here?

559
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,623
No.

560
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,398
I really thought

561
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,532
it was going to go bad for a minute.

562
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,871
I was sure it would.

563
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,639
No kidding.
You almost let me detonate

564
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,373
a thousand feet from the ground.

565
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,449
So much for camaraderie.

566
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,983
Mr. Rumsen sent this over.

567
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,646
Unopened. Very nice.

568
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,851
Hildy, stay. Have a drink. It's an order.

569
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,052
No, thank you.

570
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,493
I'm going to my parents' after work.

571
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,827
You know, when something
good happens to me,

572
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,161
it also happens to you.

573
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,894
I know that.

574
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,096
I said congratulations.

575
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,799
You should do something
with that sour puss.

576
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,204
You're very beautiful.

577
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,005
Just being honest.

578
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,275
I love watching you walk.

579
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,150
I should go.

580
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,679
You should.

581
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,139
Is he in?

582
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,778
Always nice to see you.

583
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,623
I'd give you my assurance

584
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,555
that nothing good will happen to that boy,

585
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,958
but I can't seem
to keep my word on that,

586
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,086
hard as I try.

587
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,291
I might ask you to take me with you.

588
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,391
I see no reason to leave.

589
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,271
Or maybe I see a million.

590
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,773
A million? Is that
what it's going to cost me?

591
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,867
I was thinking more like 40.

592
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,639
45 is good.

593
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,521
I'm not going to be a little girl
and ask you why you stayed.

594
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,989
I know it's not money,

595
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,890
and I hope it's not to keep
your foot on Pete Campbell.

596
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,622
I like the way you do business.

597
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,528
Well, I try to be
as civilized as you can be.

598
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:37,925
No contract.

599
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,333
45 and no security.

600
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,030
What's in it for me?

601
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:49,670
If I leave this place one day,
it will not be for more advertising.

602
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,408
What else is there?

603
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,576
I don't know. Life being lived.

604
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,753
I'd like to stop talking about it
and get back to it.

605
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,847
I've worked with a lot of men like you,

606
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:05,361
and if you had to choose a place to die,
it would be in the middle of a pitch.

607
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,589
I've done that.

608
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,793
I want to do something else.

609
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,051
Jim Hobart, McCann Erickson.

610
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,210
Of course.

611
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,184
<i>Line 1.</i>

612
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,928
<i>Don,</i>

613
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,156
incredible pictures, am I wrong?

614
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,731
<i>No, you're not.</i>

615
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,697
So, your wife's already here with us.

616
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:44,927
I know she's happy.

617
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,264
Why don't you join her?

618
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,271
I don't know about that, Jim.

619
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,772
You can do better than that.

620
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,036
You know what I'm offering here?

621
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,044
It's Yankee Stadium. I know.

622
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,377
<i>What, did Sterling come to the rescue?</i>

623
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,710
<i>If this is about money,</i>

624
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,377
<i>I have to say I might
have judged you wrong.</i>

625
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,817
It's not.

626
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,388
I'm surprised.

627
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,458
I thought your wife coming here
meant you were interested.

628
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,789
No, that was her idea.

629
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,193
Can't blame me for trying.

630
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,527
Maybe not, but, uh...

631
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,168
I can't exactly say
that was a big league move.

632
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,372
All's fair. No stone unturned, right?

633
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,270
<i>It's a pity to lose both of you.</i>

634
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,315
You're a very lucky man,
landing that woman.

635
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,393
What's going on with Mr. Draper?

636
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,092
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

637
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,498
Very good.

638
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,036
I've been meaning
to give this back to you.

639
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,662
I had it completely dry cleaned.

640
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,601
Why don't you keep it?

641
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,041
Have it taken in here and let out there.

642
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,544
It's your dress.

643
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,673
Hot tea. That's a good idea.

644
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,377
What are you talking about?

645
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:15,355
Peggy, you are falling prey
to a very common situation for new girls.

646
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,858
I'm not new anymore.

647
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,485
Well, that's just it.

648
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,121
Don't you want to do well here?

649
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:26,727
I'm the first girl to do any writing
in this office since the war.

650
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:27,997
Marge told me.

651
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,970
Writing?

652
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,405
Is that what this is about?

653
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,069
I thought you were doing that
to get close to Paul.

654
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,309
Thank you. Again.

655
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,442
I heard you were being
considered for an account

656
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,850
because a client's wife saw you

657
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,354
and thought it would be okay
if he worked with you.

658
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,084
You know, you're not a stick.

659
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,752
And yet I never wonder
what men think of me.

660
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,264
You're hiding a very attractive young girl
with too much lunch.

661
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,357
I know what men think of you:

662
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:01,336
That you're looking for a husband,
and you're fun,

663
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,634
and not in that order.

664
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,270
Peggy, this isn't China.

665
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,106
There's no money in virginity.

666
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,338
I'm not a virgin.

667
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,615
No. Of course not.

668
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,021
I just realized something.

669
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,628
You think you're being helpful.

670
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,166
Well, I am trying, dear.

671
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,835
I'm going home.

672
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,715
Did you have a good day?

673
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,911
I did. It was splendid.

674
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,581
Well, Betty, I have some good news
and some bad news.

675
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,282
There's bad news?

676
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,522
The client's moving
the international work to London.

677
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,120
Oh.

678
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,963
More Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.

679
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,058
I see.

680
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,330
As for us,

681
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,338
we're all going back to the malt shop.

682
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,035
The good news is you have two
wonderful sets of pictures

683
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,475
to start your book again.

684
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,068
That's true.

685
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,045
I really am sorry.

686
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,550
This was fun.

687
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,177
You can keep the dress
and the hairstyle.

688
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,188
I don't do that for everyone.

689
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,358
Oh, honey,

690
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,953
it has nothing to do with you.

691
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,676
Thank you.

692
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,713
What do you think, Paul?

693
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,222
Should we move this whole thing

694
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,222
down to MacDougal Street?

695
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,883
We're doing great here.

696
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,059
It's good she left.

697
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,465
It probably wasn't
going to happen for her tonight.

698
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,003
It depends how much we drink.

699
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,969
How drunk do you have to be?

700
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,709
My brother works at the Exchange.

701
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,211
They call a girl like her a lobster.

702
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,747
All the meat's in the tail.

703
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,950
Are they giving you guys a bonus?

704
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,118
Would you calm down?

705
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,761
Come on!

706
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,560
Drop you at the station?

707
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,036
Sure.

708
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,919
Campbell, you sucker-punched me.

709
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,249
What is wrong with you?

710
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,615
Come on.

711
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,821
You just had a fight,

712
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,422
and I was not part of it.

713
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,903
Either you two make up,
or I do not stand a chance tonight.

714
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,871
Perfect timing.

715
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,573
The children are down,

716
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,279
but only because they were
running around all day.

717
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,413
They fell asleep in front of the TV.

718
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,582
How did it go today?

719
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,058
Good. Fun.

720
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,426
They were talking about a whole string
of other possibilities for me.

721
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,901
But honestly,
I don't think I want to work anymore.

722
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,300
I don't like you coming home to some...
whipped-together mess

723
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,643
of whatever's left in the fridge.

724
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:09,845
And frankly, I don't like
Manhattan on my own.

725
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,346
It's harsh.

726
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,319
It can be.

727
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,124
And what am I going to do?

728
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,630
Run around the city with my book,

729
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,497
like some teenager,
making a fool of myself?

730
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,296
If that's what you want,

731
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,773
and it's my job
to give you what you want.

732
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,104
You do.

733
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,878
Look at all this.

734
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,683
I don't know what I was thinking.

735
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,922
Birdie, you know I don't care

736
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:59,265
about making my dinner
or... taking in my shirts.

737
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,894
You have a job.

738
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,634
You're mother to those two little people,

739
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,677
and you are better at it
than anyone else in the world.

740
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,581
At least in the top 500.

741
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:25,259
I would have given anything
to have had a mother like you.

742
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,592
Beautiful and kind...

743
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,692
filled with love like an angel.

744
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,704
You're sweet.

745
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,820
And this does not taste whipped-up.

746
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,417
No. It's good, isn't it?

747
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,407
Have a good day, Daddy.

748
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,408
You, too.

749
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,569
Have a good day.

750
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,580
We're going to the community center
to watch them fill the pool.

751
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,910
That sounds fun.

752
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:21,983
Have a good day.

753
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,553
I already am.

754
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,718
Mommy, I'm eating.

755
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,671
Be careful.
Don't jump off the bed.

756
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,044
Okay!

757
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,514
Mrs. Draper,
what the hell are you doing?

758
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,278
Mrs. Draper!
