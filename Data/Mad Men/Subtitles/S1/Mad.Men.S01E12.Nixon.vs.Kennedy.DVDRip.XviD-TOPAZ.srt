1
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,498
<i>America is still going
to the polls at 4:00.</i>

2
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,009
<i>With some precincts opening
as early as 12 this morning,</i>

3
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,635
<i>voters across the country are deciding</i>

4
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,237
<i>who will hold the most important
office in the fr...</i>

5
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,952
Herman Phillips, Bert Cooper.

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,823
Actually, "Herman" goes on my checks.

7
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,156
People call me Duck.

8
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,094
My research says I was not to call you Duck.

9
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,358
You should have told me that.

10
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,457
I don't know. I like when you say Herman.

11
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,734
Herman was in London with Y&R.

12
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,602
Isn't this a step down?

13
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,605
I don't know.

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,869
Moving back to the power center
of the universe, New York,

15
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,036
and the chance to put on some weight.

16
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,775
English food. I actually ate a kidney.

17
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,646
He landed American Airlines.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,845
You could make something
like that happen here.

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,819
Well, you have to
spend money to make money.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,481
So you're not promising anything.

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,058
Why would I do that?

22
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,528
My goodness, he does want this job.

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,690
I hope you play your cards
close to the vest with clients.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,563
I will keep that in mind.

25
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,432
Here's a test. Who'd you vote for?

26
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,506
If I say Nixon, you'll think
I'm buttering you.

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,802
If I say Kennedy,
you'll want to reform me.

28
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,309
So, uh, I'll say Nixon.

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,880
That's nice to see.

30
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,223
Cooper has a smoker
at The Waldorf at 6:00.

31
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,225
Marge told me.

32
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,317
23 skidoo.

33
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,160
At 6:15, we turn on the returns
and send for some ice.

34
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,858
Party at the in-laws'.

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,560
Another ending to a perfect day.

36
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,137
<i>Well, Jennifer and I were going
to get tickets to Can-Can.</i>

37
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,433
It's empty, you know.

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,168
She says apparently the phone company
is a war zone on election night.

39
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,607
That's what I'm
hoping for around here.

40
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,043
Although, You better hope that
she's sitting at her switchboard

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,910
and not doing what we're doing.

42
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,380
It's my wife.

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,714
Besides, what if Nixon loses?

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,151
Won't that put a damper
on things around here?

45
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,155
Who cares? They didn't want our help.

46
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,417
You should care.

47
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,688
I do. It matters for the nation
and for Sterling Coop.

48
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,557
But tonight, either way.

49
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,130
If Nixon wins, we win.

50
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,528
If Nixon loses...

51
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,035
let me console you.

52
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,671
That's him.

53
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,212
Duck Phillips.

54
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,576
I know his name.

55
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,206
Because it's Duck?

56
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,918
I grew up with a Tuck.

57
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,853
At least that has an air of dignity.

58
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,221
Don took him to Cooper. That's a first.

59
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,419
I heard he disintegrated in London.

60
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,123
Got involved with some woman
he met at the British Museum.

61
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,790
Her name was Rosetta.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,697
Rosetta Stone.

63
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,866
He's divorced. Lives in a hotel.

64
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,500
So what's this? His last stop?

65
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,044
No. He's a killer, but he's...
he's damaged goods.

66
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,238
They're bargain hunting.

67
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,178
He's the best one
Draper's paraded around.

68
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,581
Let's see if Cooper's
smart enough to know that.

69
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,520
Can I help you?

70
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,092
What?

71
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,922
Can I help you?

72
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,693
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.

73
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,935
<i>Send him in.</i>

74
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,662
Thank you, sweetheart.

75
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,072
So that Duck fellow,

76
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,150
I heard he fell apart in London.

77
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,878
American Airlines.

78
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,977
$7 million in billings.

79
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,556
He's not going to bring that with him.

80
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:25,562
Listen, Don, I don't feel you've taken me
seriously as a candidate.

81
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,927
Candidate for what?

82
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,469
For the head of account services.

83
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,299
We may have had our differences,

84
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,464
but Roger knows I've done everything
I could to emulate him.

85
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,405
Roger's not involved in this.

86
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,908
Anything else?

87
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,946
I have the loyalty
of our most important clients:

88
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,844
Calvin Highland, Lee Garner.

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,507
These men trust me.

90
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,346
They invite me
to their grandchildren's christenings.

91
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,420
When Walter Veidt needed a urologist,

92
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,113
he called me
for a recommendation.

93
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,592
Look, you're good at your job.
Cooper loves you.

94
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,854
What's the hurry?

95
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,259
It's been two and a half years.

96
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,058
I could have jumped
ship a hundred times.

97
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,224
Is that supposed to persuade me?

98
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,403
I have tremendous value
to this company.

99
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,030
I'm aware of that.

100
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,403
But I don't think you are.

101
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,070
I am. I just hope you realize
that, the way things stand,

102
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,204
there will continue to be
someone senior to you.

103
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,304
Why?

104
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,008
What can they offer?

105
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,953
All I'm asking is that you think about it.

106
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,459
There are men younger than me
with this job at bigger firms.

107
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,460
Cooper sign off on what's-his-name?

108
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,554
Duck?

109
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll keep you posted.

110
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,870
He's got a big lead.

111
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,039
See you at the victory
party in the morning.

112
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,047
Absolutely.

113
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,243
Well, good night, Don.

114
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,420
He's gone!

115
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,387
Olly olly oxen free!

116
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,954
- Do it.
- All rightie.

117
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,996
- Who's got the cups?
- Oh. Sorry.

118
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,862
<i>With early returns just coming in,</i>

119
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,801
<i>our NBC computer is putting
Senator Kennedy's odds for victory</i>

120
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,065
<i>at a grim-sounding 22-1.</i>

121
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,445
This is not good.

122
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,037
And liquor stores are closed tonight.

123
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,946
Draper has plenty of booze.

124
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,980
We could ask her to join us.

125
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,150
That might soften her up a bit.

126
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,319
I have a bottle of absinthe in my office.

127
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,487
Isn't that illegal?

128
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,655
It's marvelous.

129
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,699
I become incantatory.

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,267
And what does that mean?

131
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,029
It means he starts making up words.

132
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,798
Can someone freshen this?

133
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,569
We're not going to make it.

134
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,836
Really?

135
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,907
If I let you into that supply closet,
it is not going to be the sack of Rome.

136
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,043
What do we have too much of?

137
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,884
Rum, creme de menthe,

138
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,321
dog biscuits.

139
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,764
May the best man win.

140
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,324
In matters national and... local.

141
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,106
<i>...majority decision of the American...</i>

142
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,634
<i>I made my judgment long ago.</i>

143
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,213
Stop that. You're going to break it.

144
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,908
Look. They're doing math.

145
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,609
What do the numbers say?

146
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,050
Who the president is going to be.

147
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,517
Hello.

148
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,958
Daddy! Hi!

149
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,030
I wasn't expecting you.

150
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,625
I thought you were going to be
watching returns at the office.

151
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,226
What are you doing up?

152
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,135
Mommy said it was okay.

153
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,299
I'm watching the news.

154
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,036
Nixon definitely won our precinct.

155
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,475
You should have seen the line.

156
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,047
Mommy said to ask you. What's the...

157
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,241
Electoral College.

158
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,447
I don't think that's a conversation
appropriate for children.

159
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,954
Come here.

160
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,718
Do you want something to eat?

161
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,294
I'm going to fix a drink. You?

162
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,862
I'm set.

163
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,330
<i>Senator Kennedy seems
to be closing the gap</i>

164
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,266
<i>on the vice president's early lead.</i>

165
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,237
<i>State-by-state, Ohio, Illinois...</i>

166
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,200
Come here.

167
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,504
What?

168
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,410
You better run.

169
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,107
Go, Allison!

170
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,716
White!

171
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,116
Pink!

172
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,220
You can tell me, or I can find out.

173
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,626
What color panties are you wearing?

174
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,562
What? Oh, my G...

175
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,028
Blue!

176
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,731
Who had blue?

177
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,745
Can I walk you home?

178
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,882
I used to think I'd find a husband here.

179
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,548
I think I'm going to go home.

180
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,957
No, don't go. It's going to be fun.

181
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,933
What are you doing?

182
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,367
Why aren't you asleep?

183
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,699
What is that?

184
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,433
Nothing.

185
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,939
Myrna found it on the top of the closet,

186
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,705
and I didn't want to look at it.

187
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,450
My father has a box like that,

188
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,077
and I looked at it when I was a little girl,

189
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,280
and it was a mistake.

190
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,220
So you didn't open it?

191
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,316
Peter, I don't want secrets.

192
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,192
I can't sleep.

193
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,199
I know.

194
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,600
I've seen it the last few weeks.

195
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,103
You're not very quiet,

196
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,197
and every time I see
the closet door is open

197
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,105
and that box is gone,
I know you're out here.

198
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,203
And you never looked in the box?

199
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,544
It's not yours.

200
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,878
What are you doing with it?

201
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,178
I got it by mistake.

202
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,150
So give it back.

203
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,984
It's peculiar.

204
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,058
It's not yours.

205
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,188
Come to bed.

206
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,365
<i>Vice President Nixon
seems to have carried</i>

207
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,965
<i>predominantly Catholic
Hudson County, New Jersey.</i>

208
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,806
Kinsey, you're a liar.

209
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,107
I couldn't find any absinthe.

210
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,943
Who said you could go in my office?

211
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,018
We were exploring.

212
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,849
<i>But all we found was
a large collection of Mad magazines</i>

213
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,948
and this fascinating dramatic piece.

214
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,756
<i>Death is My Client... Whoa.</i>

215
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,831
A play in one act by Paul Kinsey.

216
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,990
Give it to me.

217
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,397
"Peter Tollifson"...

218
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,006
"An animal in the board room
and the bedroom. "

219
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,404
- Kenny!
- Whoa!

220
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,602
Now, remember, he's angry.

221
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,272
Why do I have to play Tollifson?

222
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,508
I wanted to be Galt.

223
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,210
Tollifson is the hero. He thinks.

224
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,388
Galt's a thug born on the wrong
side of the tracks.

225
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,185
You don't want to be Galt.

226
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,593
Go ahead.

227
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,325
I'm sorry. I don't have the pages.

228
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,963
Oh. Sorry.

229
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,801
Um, "I worked with Tollifson for four years.

230
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,102
I shared everything,
but I never knew him. "

231
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,973
"I thought I knew him.

232
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,069
He used to talk to me. "

233
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,011
"I can't control my genius.

234
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,448
I'm not some boorish natural
like that hack Cosgrove. "

235
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,820
That's crackerjack, Kinsey.

236
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,690
"Your genius be damned. "

237
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,227
"Perhaps. "

238
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,354
"You can make anyone buy anything.

239
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,955
Anyone but me. "

240
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,968
Turn the music down.

241
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,198
<i>We now have confirmation</i>

242
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:34,109
<i>that the State of Ohio has indeed gone
to Vice President Richard Nixon.</i>

243
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,650
<i>Its 25 electoral votes
will go in Mr. Nixon's purse.</i>

244
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:52,996
I'm...

245
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,157
I'm really tipsy.

246
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,842
I feel awful.

247
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,480
No, no. Uh... it was me.

248
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,559
I'm... I'm drunk.

249
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,421
I'm happy... but not myself.

250
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,600
I've never really
seen your eyes before.

251
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,775
There they are.

252
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,141
Just the two of them.

253
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,888
<i>As Vice President Nixon's
home state of California</i>

254
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,656
<i>continues to count ballots,</i>

255
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,197
<i>both candidates bid
their supporters a good night.</i>

256
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,733
<i>Vice presidential hopeful
Senator Lyndon Johnson</i>

257
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,826
<i>had these words:</i>

258
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,667
<i>I'm very proud of the manner</i>

259
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,365
<i>in which the Democratic
campaign has been conducted</i>

260
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,340
<i>and which the people have reacted,</i>

261
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,935
<i>particularly in my state,
the entire South,</i>

262
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:15,945
<i>and in many states...</i>

263
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,345
What's going on?

264
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,417
<i>- I don't know.
... feel, uh, very confident...</i>

265
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,678
It'll be all right in the morning.

266
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,718
He'll win California.

267
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,651
<i>...the counting that...</i>

268
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,745
Turn it off.

269
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,881
<i>All Americans will be proud,</i>

270
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,754
<i>and I think we have
much to be proud of.</i>

271
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,055
<i>I think this is one
of America's finest hours.</i>

272
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,667
Sit down.

273
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,503
No.

274
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,477
You can't sit down in that dress.

275
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,979
You look so different
when you're drunk.

276
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,522
You're not going to call me
Orson Welles again.

277
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,784
You loved that.

278
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,757
Who wouldn't like that?

279
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,962
What did I do wrong?

280
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,701
You have a big mouth.

281
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,932
Joan, I never said...

282
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,598
You have a big mouth.

283
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,909
I do.

284
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,676
I'm not proud of it.

285
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,082
Did you like the play?

286
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,482
No.

287
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,327
The meaner you are, the more I like you.

288
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,988
I know.

289
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,370
Just like that?

290
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,037
I thought we could dance.

291
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,989
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

292
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,350
Hildy, wake up.

293
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,146
Mm, it's cold in here.

294
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,585
It is. You have to get dressed.

295
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,666
I can't find my glasses.

296
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,502
That's too bad.

297
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,442
Tremendous.

298
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,621
Harry?

299
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,350
Yes?

300
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,321
I hope I didn't step on them.

301
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,663
Damn it.

302
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,305
There's an optometrist on Lexington.

303
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,940
Great. Of course.

304
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,563
I don't want you to be worried.

305
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,258
It didn't mean anything, okay?

306
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,411
You're not drinking for taste.

307
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,039
Don't be such babies.

308
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,949
Oh, God.

309
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,853
It's definitely not helping.

310
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,392
I'm sorry. Does it offend you?

311
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,432
My shirt. And my mad money.
Who did this?

312
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,664
I stole your blouse.

313
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,832
I'm not joking. I had $3.00 in here.

314
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,139
If I give you $3.00,
will you keep your voice down?

315
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,406
You're animals.

316
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,142
I'm reporting it to building security.

317
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,777
Striking resemblance
to Broderick Crawford.

318
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,617
Peggy Olsen, Highway Patrol.

319
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,263
I've read three different newspapers
with three different results.

320
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,929
I'm sure you know something I don't.

321
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,033
Well, I just spent the night literally
in a smoke-filled room at The Waldorf

322
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:50,843
with every Republican luminary
save MacArthur and Jesus.

323
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,814
There's been widespread fraud.

324
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:59,221
Daley gave Joe Kennedy
every corpse in Cook County.

325
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,758
Otherwise, Nixon wins.

326
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,987
It shouldn't have been that close.

327
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,087
But it is. It always is.

328
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,928
Those jingles.

329
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,468
When they got Frank Sinatra,

330
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,128
I knew they would close the gap.

331
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,763
So what does he do now?

332
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,171
Walk away? Concede?

333
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,235
A recount in Illinois alone
means 30 days without a president.

334
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,938
You don't want to win like that.

335
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,175
But you want to win.

336
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,650
He got 50% of the vote, maybe more.

337
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,584
This way he lives to see another day.

338
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,781
So... what happens?

339
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,351
Neil from P&G said if Kennedy
is willing to buy an election,

340
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,125
he's probably willing to play ball with us.

341
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,428
Ah, the optimism
of the American corporation.

342
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,366
It's a football game to them.

343
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,664
Doesn't seem fair.

344
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,739
Fair?

345
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,100
Very good.

346
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,248
Where do you think you're going?

347
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,513
If I were you,

348
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,248
I would be very,
very careful from now on

349
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,221
about the way you speak to me.

350
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,724
Can I help you?

351
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,031
What's that?

352
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,795
It's yours.

353
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,337
It came to me by mistake.

354
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,633
Well, thanks.

355
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,972
Have you reconsidered
my qualifications

356
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,942
for the head of account services?

357
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,481
Would it disappoint you
if I told you it hadn't crossed my mind?

358
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,694
I feel strange having
to talk to you in this way.

359
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,331
Spit it out, Campbell.

360
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,772
I know that your name
is not Donald Draper.

361
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,277
It's Dick Whitman.

362
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,051
I don't know who Donald Draper is,

363
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,420
but according to my friend Russ
at the Department of Defense,

364
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,925
Dick Whitman died in Korea in 1950,

365
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,325
and Donald Draper dropped off the map.

366
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,863
Although he's 43 years old,

367
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,433
in which case
you look remarkably good.

368
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,300
That's kind of elaborate.

369
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,372
Really?

370
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,940
I wish I knew more.

371
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,668
I bet a lot of people do.

372
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,042
Pete...

373
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,375
get out.

374
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,914
You're making a fool of yourself.

375
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,849
You can deny it.

376
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,419
But I know it's true.

377
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,818
I can see from your face.

378
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,748
You should leave.

379
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,952
Don...

380
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,928
you should think about
how Bert Cooper will react

381
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,430
when he hears this information.

382
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,465
What information?

383
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,434
You're not who you say you are,

384
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,301
and there's obviously a reason.

385
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,101
Come on.

386
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:08,373
I would like you
to reconsider my qualifications.

387
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,759
You said everything except "or else. "

388
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,864
Assuming this information
is true, which it isn't,

389
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,268
it sounds to me like
you're blackmailing me.

390
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,703
I'm not.

391
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:43,010
I'm hoping you'll realize
that this all can be forgotten.

392
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,981
It's not like you're a deserter, is it?

393
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,021
When you threaten someone
in this manner,

394
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,056
you should be aware of the fact

395
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,955
that if your information
is powerful enough

396
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,960
to make them do what you want...

397
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,264
what else can it make them do?

398
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,659
It's very simple.

399
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,760
And it's not a threat. It's just a job.

400
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,037
Think about it.

401
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,220
Whitman.

402
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,523
Yes, Sergeant.

403
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,926
What is this?

404
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,764
This is it.

405
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,035
One? I'm supposed to have 20.

406
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,200
This is going to take a month,
and it should take 48 hours.

407
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,835
Well, you're whining to the wrong guy, sir.

408
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,622
At ease.

409
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,026
Uh, this is for officers.

410
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,625
You can bunk next door.

411
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,705
I- I'd introduce you to the men,

412
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:51,333
but you're looking
at the complete company.

413
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,808
Where is everybody, sir?

414
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,505
They were gone when I got here.

415
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,275
I'm an engineer.

416
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,646
They're in some action
5 miles over that mountain.

417
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,514
You want to go?

418
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,952
The answer is no.

419
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,218
The locals stopped
showing up three days ago,

420
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,520
which, by the way, is not good.

421
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,062
You're going to be doing all the digging.

422
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,357
Digging what?

423
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,525
Well, this unit... that's you...

424
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,229
will be establishing a field hospital,

425
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:23,706
but first we're going to be digging
fighting positions on four sides.

426
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,205
What are you doing here?
Are you poor?

427
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,009
I volunteered.

428
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,209
You're kidding me.

429
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,309
Well, they got me with college.

430
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,686
But I'm three years,
six months nearly a civilian.

431
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,990
I'm supposed to be building
swimming pools, not latrines.

432
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,757
You any good with that rifle?

433
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,231
I wouldn't want you
to mistake me for Chinese.

434
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,064
As much practice as I've had, yes.

435
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,999
What misconception
traveled down the road

436
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,667
and made you want to be here?

437
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,676
A movie?

438
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,179
No. I just wanted to leave.

439
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,876
I'll bet you're reconsidering
if this was a step up.

440
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,344
<i>Miss Menken,</i>

441
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,046
<i>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

442
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,752
Please hold my calls.

443
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,429
Did you run over? You're flushed.

444
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,247
Let's go away.

445
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,117
Really? Where?

446
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,554
Anywhere.

447
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,249
Warmer weather?

448
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,486
Sure.

449
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,926
How about Los Angeles?

450
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,224
Mexico? I have money.

451
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,096
I have money, but I have a store to run.

452
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,570
Don, are you well?

453
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,141
No, I'm not.

454
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,542
Did something else happen to Roger?

455
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,580
No.

456
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,582
Something happened, and...

457
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,845
I want to go, and I want you
to come with me,

458
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,012
and I don't want to come back.

459
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,180
What happened?

460
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,259
What does it matter?
Isn't this what you want?

461
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,522
Of course. I've thought about it.

462
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,157
My God, we've talked about it.

463
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,565
I just...

464
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,297
I just didn't think it would happen...

465
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,566
I mean, especially this way.

466
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,273
I just... don't want to be without you,

467
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,746
and I don't want to be here.

468
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,783
I can't just leave.

469
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,320
Maybe this weekend...

470
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,391
Rachel.

471
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,760
No. This isn't how
I thought it would be.

472
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,235
What is the difference?

473
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,363
We'll go somewhere else.

474
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,407
We'll start over like Adam and Eve.

475
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
What, are you 15 years old?

476
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,874
My father...

477
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,572
Can't we be together here?

478
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,979
There's nothing here.

479
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,143
What about your children?

480
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,017
I'll provide for them.

481
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,283
And live in Los Angeles?

482
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:05,019
My God, you haven't
thought this through.

483
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,687
I feel sick.

484
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,425
You're wrong. I know exactly what I want.

485
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,933
You want your children
to go on without a father?

486
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,366
You know how that felt.

487
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,461
Are you having an attack
of conscience after all this?

488
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,040
No. I'm watching you talk

489
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,041
because I feel I don't know you.

490
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,806
You know more about me
than anyone.

491
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,475
You won't even tell me what happened.

492
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,854
Why are you doing this to me?

493
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,689
What kind of man are you?

494
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,822
Go away, drop everything, leave your life?

495
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,696
People do it every day.

496
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,966
- This was a dalliance, a cheap affair.
- Rachel, don't.

497
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,507
You don't want to run away with me.

498
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,577
You just want to run away.

499
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,680
You're a coward.

500
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,482
Please go now.

501
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,246
Get out.

502
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,458
Peggy, this is my office.

503
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,790
Does this door mean nothing to you?

504
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,489
I'm sorry, Mr. Draper.

505
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,225
I didn't know you were coming back. I just...

506
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,030
I just...

507
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,036
Calm down.

508
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,613
Stop it.

509
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,315
I didn't mean to yell at you.

510
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,051
Got to be some semblance
of privacy left here.

511
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,486
I had to get away from them all
for a minute.

512
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,398
Drink this.

513
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:39,275
Sonny from the elevator
and some janitor... I don't know his name...

514
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,113
they got fired.

515
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,244
That's why you're crying?

516
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,822
It was my fault.

517
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,720
I called security.

518
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,421
They weren't even here last night.

519
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,224
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.

520
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,063
I know.

521
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,533
I know.

522
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,007
I don't understand.

523
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,579
I try to do my job.

524
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,739
I follow the rules,

525
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,511
and people hate me.

526
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,020
Innocent people get hurt, and...

527
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,556
and other people...

528
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,456
people who are not good...

529
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,257
get to walk around
doing whatever they want.

530
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,632
It's not fair.

531
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,894
Finish it.

532
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,076
I've thought about what you said.

533
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,414
Glad to hear it.

534
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,317
And then I thought about you

535
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,822
and what a deep lack
of character you have.

536
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,531
I can understand your frustration, Don.

537
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,657
Believe me, I'm not enjoying this
any more than you are.

538
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,428
I'm hiring Duck Phillips.

539
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,368
Don...

540
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,838
don't make me go to Cooper.

541
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,772
I'm not making you do anything.

542
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,777
You haven't thought this through.

543
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,437
- I have.
- Really?

544
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,744
You're just going to go up to the office
and tell Bert Cooper.

545
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,909
If I have to. I don't want to.

546
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,486
Let me ask you.

547
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:00,318
How do you think he'll react
when you tell him this story of yours?

548
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,484
You expect him to promote you
after the way you've behaved?

549
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,221
I think he'll appreciate the loyalty.

550
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,923
You haven't thought this through.

551
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,595
I don't know.

552
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,365
But I'm pretty sure
you won't be working here anymore.

553
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,847
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

554
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,854
I'm going to take care of this right now.

555
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,446
Is this like in the movies
where I have a gun

556
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,957
and you don't think
I'm going to shoot you?

557
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,287
I will shoot you.

558
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,055
I won't let you hold this over my head.

559
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,995
So you'd rather blow yourself up
than make me head of accounts.

560
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,637
Why can't you give me what I want?

561
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,041
I've earned this job. I deserve it.

562
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,841
Why? Because your parents are rich?

563
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,577
Because you went to prep school
and have a $5.00 haircut?

564
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,913
You've been given everything.

565
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,919
You've never worked
for anything in your life.

566
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,115
For gosh sakes, don't you realize
you're going to lose everything?

567
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,056
I'm giving you a way out.

568
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,491
Would it be so bad?

569
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,688
Why is this so hard for you?

570
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,667
You're really going to do this?

571
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,811
More bad news?

572
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,978
If you came here
to drown your sorrows,

573
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,056
I'm not really much of a drinker.

574
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,953
No. I just wanted to say...

575
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,351
I'm pulling the trigger
on Duck Phillips

576
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,952
as new head of account services.

577
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,499
Oh, good. Well done.

578
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,711
What?

579
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:06,444
I have to bring this up to you.

580
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,041
Only because I believe
if I kept it from you

581
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,485
in the end it would be
damaging to Sterling Cooper.

582
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,557
It has come to my attention,
completely by accident,

583
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,527
that Donald Draper here
is not who he says he is.

584
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,723
His real name is Dick Whitman,

585
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,893
but... Dick Whitman
died in Korea ten years ago.

586
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:31,703
It stands to reason
that he is a deserter at the very least

587
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,242
and who knows what else.

588
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,032
Mr. Campbell, who cares?

589
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,640
What?

590
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,299
Who cares?

591
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,242
Mr. Cooper, he's a fraud and a liar.

592
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,404
A criminal, even.

593
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,179
Even if this were true, who cares?

594
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,947
This country was built and run
by men with worse stories

595
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,215
than whatever you've imagined here.

596
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,553
I'm not imagining anything.

597
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,523
The Japanese have a saying:

598
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,430
A man is whatever room he is in,

599
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:36,097
and right now Donald Draper
is in this room.

600
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,573
I assure you,

601
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,612
there's more profit in forgetting this.

602
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,443
I'd put your energy
into bringing in accounts.

603
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,991
Don,

604
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,552
fire him if you want.

605
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,156
But I'd keep an eye on him.

606
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,863
One never knows how loyalty is born.

607
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,462
Shit!

608
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,392
Sir, what do we do?

609
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,432
Keep your head.

610
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,433
Don't shoot at anything

611
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,901
unless it shoots at you first.

612
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,464
What? What? What?

613
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,066
Shut up! Just stay down!

614
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,338
Shit!

615
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,038
Don't they know this is a hospital?

616
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,547
We're nuts if they know that.

617
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,094
Is it over?

618
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,457
I don't know.

619
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,608
- You think they'll be back?
- I don't know.

620
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,681
We didn't shoot back. That helps.

621
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,345
You pissed yourself.

622
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,652
What?

623
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,055
Did I?

624
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,660
Crap.

625
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,719
How are we doing, Lieutenant Draper?

626
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,432
On behalf of the President
of the United States

627
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,405
and the citizens
of the United States of America...

628
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:30,274
I present you with
this Purple Heart medal.

629
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,076
The concussion was minor.

630
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,412
You'll feel like yourself in a week.

631
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,659
The colonel here
has some good news for you.

632
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,729
We're releasing you to the Reserves
for your last 80 days.

633
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,729
You're going home.

634
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,099
That's good news.
You're going to be okay.

635
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,773
Lieutenant Draper,

636
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,714
Private Whitman.

637
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,912
You were the last person who knew him
in his chain of command.

638
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,319
We'd like you to take him home.

639
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,093
I think it would mean something.

640
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,135
Lieutenant Nelson, how you doing?

641
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,565
On behalf of the President
of the United States

642
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,701
and the citizens of
the United States of America...

643
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,848
Bunbury.

644
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,285
This is us, Lieutenant.

645
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,345
Lieutenant Draper?

646
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,486
Just go.

647
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,886
I can't.

648
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,862
Okay.

649
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,770
There he is! I see him!

650
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,143
Who?

651
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,682
Dick. He's on the train.

652
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,682
I see him.

653
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,480
No, he's right here.

654
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,110
But I saw him.

655
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,245
I saw him in the window over there.

656
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,348
Stop it. No more of that.

657
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,986
It must be hard for you.

658
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,358
Did you know him?

659
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,325
A little.

660
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,029
You got your whole life ahead of you.

661
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,729
Forget that boy in the box.

662
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,209
Look at you.

663
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,980
Let me buy a soldier a drink.

664
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,853
Dick!

665
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:23,438
<i>With that, I want to say again</i>

666
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,415
<i>my deep thanks
to all of you who are here</i>

667
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:31,010
<i>and those who have listened
on television and radio,</i>

668
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:35,148
<i>and again my congratulations
to Senator Kennedy</i>

669
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,092
<i>for his fine race in this campaign,</i>

670
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,686
<i>and to all of you...</i>

671
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,192
<i>I am sure...</i>

672
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,529
<i>I am sure his supporters</i>

673
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,399
<i>are just as enthusiastic
as you are for me,</i>

674
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,369
<i>and I thank you for that.</i>
