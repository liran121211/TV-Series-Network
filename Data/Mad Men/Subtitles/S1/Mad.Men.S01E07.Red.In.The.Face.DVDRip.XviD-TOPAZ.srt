1
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:44,236
I know you said to call at night,
but, uh, I haven't been alone.

2
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,440
<i>I understand. I have a moment.</i>

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,072
So how is she?

4
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,743
Well, it's only been a short period
in therapeutic time.

5
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,080
<i>But she's making progress?</i>

6
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,645
<i>She's not particularly forthcoming yet.</i>

7
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,452
What has she been talking about?

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,687
Mostly, she seems consumed
with petty jealousies

9
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,424
and overwhelmed
with everyday activities.

10
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,966
Basically, we're dealing with
the emotions of a child here.

11
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,763
She wasn't always like this.

12
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,432
Well, we're finding that this kind of anxiety
is not uncommon in housewives.

13
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:20,002
<i>And let's not forget, the death of a parent
is extremely destabilizing.</i>

14
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,410
So that's it.

15
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,607
<i>Well, that's the beginning, certainly.</i>

16
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,616
As she becomes more
forthcoming, we may be able

17
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,482
to shed some light on the deeper issues
as she talks more.

18
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,421
<i>- There are deeper issues?
- Usually.</i>

19
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,960
These are not groundbreaking
revelations, Mr. Draper.

20
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,926
I'm concerned, obviously.

21
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,794
Of course. We both are.

22
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,629
Time and talk. That's what I
recommend right now.

23
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,635
And again, evenings are better for me.

24
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,762
Well, I appreciate your time.

25
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,306
Mona, I am drinking my milk right now.

26
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:01,610
Go to Mim's. Bring the heiress.

27
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,451
The Montclair air might
wipe the scowl off her face.

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,181
Knock, knock.

29
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,654
Call me from there.

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,297
I'll try to make it out by Sunday afternoon.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,300
I just got off the phone with UFC,

32
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:20,065
and they're having the Nixon boys
stop by at the end of the week.

33
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,936
- With Nixon?
- No, thank God.

34
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,501
Otherwise, I'd have to move the piano
out of my office.

35
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,949
Hopefully, he'll decide he needs us.

36
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,576
Well, the ones with the best product
make the worst clients.

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,053
Stop smoking so much.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,648
It's a sign of weakness.

39
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,454
You know how Hitler
got Neville Chamberlain

40
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,722
to give him everything at Munich?

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,324
He held the conference
at an old palace that forbid smoking.

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,301
And after an hour and a half
of not smoking,

43
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:56,205
Neville Chamberlain would have given Hitler
his mother as a dance partner.

44
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:00,245
All I can get from this story
is that Hitler didn't smoke.

45
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,644
And I do.

46
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,684
Good night, peanut.

47
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,363
Last one to Chumley's gets
to wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,

48
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,630
published author, home in a baby carriage.

49
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,281
- Hello there.
- Good news.

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,587
Mona and Margaret are going out of town
for the weekend.

51
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,526
Mona's mother fell down the steps.

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,326
- You're really blessed.
- Come on over.

53
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,697
I'll put on my whites.
We'll pretend it's V.J. Day.

54
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,605
What goes in there, an aspirin?

55
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,540
I suppose I could have taken a suitcase
anywhere this weekend.

56
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,440
And I don't mean your apartment.

57
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,537
I got us a couple of sandwiches,
and filled a thermos for the train.

58
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,776
Mr. Sterling, this is Carol, my roommate.

59
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,284
Nice to meet you, Carol.

60
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,685
Miss Holloway, I have
an accounting question.

61
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:26,124
We will go away. Not tonight,
but some weekend coming up.

62
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,995
Puerto Rico?

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,161
I don't care if it's Cuba.
I need a little notice.

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,001
You've got a lot of rules, Red.

65
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,811
Be good, girls.

66
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,709
I don't mind you staying
late, just as long as you're not trying

67
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,306
- to milk us for the dinner money.
- It's work.

68
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,715
Just because tomorrow's Friday
doesn't mean I expect

69
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,980
to be pulling your head
off the keys in the morning.

70
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,056
What are you doing tonight?

71
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,489
Uh, working and going home.

72
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:59,463
I'll let you enjoy that one, honey,
but I was talking to Donald here.

73
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,858
- I'm on the 5:31.
- Reservations at home.

74
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,437
I've had those. Easiest ones to break.

75
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,564
Besides, they love it when
you keep them guessing. It adds spice.

76
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,937
Trying to get me in trouble?
Betty's cooking.

77
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,908
One drink. You owe me that.

78
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,347
- Did I miss something?
- No.

79
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,109
Don and I talk all the time
when you're not around.

80
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,706
In fact, we're gonna do it right now.

81
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,251
Don? Shall we?

82
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,685
- Well, good night, boys.
- Good night, Paul.

83
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,154
I love doing that.

84
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,592
You seem like a busy little girl.

85
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,392
Draper pushing you around enough?

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,726
What does that mean?

87
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,529
Burning the midnight oil
is not good for your skin.

88
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,570
Oh, no, it's...

89
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,832
It's for something else.
I'm working on copy.

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,669
On your own?

91
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,575
Mr. Rumsen liked what I did
in the brainstorming thingy.

92
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,476
Sanitary napkins?

93
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,674
- No. Lipstick.
- What did I say?

94
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,274
It's the Belle Jolie account.

95
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,219
Mr. Campbell, your wife
called from the Four Seasons.

96
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,984
- They've been seated.
- Thank you, Hildy.

97
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,461
Want me to take a look at it?
I do it for a lot of the fellows.

98
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,395
Really?

99
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,966
Yeah. Really.

100
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,160
That would be super.

101
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,260
Well, we're all in it together.

102
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,173
Two!

103
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,748
So they fired all the guys in the middle
and moved up their mail room staff,

104
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,351
right before all the salaries got expensive.

105
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,827
Smart.

106
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,898
Is that what we're gonna do?

107
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,969
We're not going to do anything.

108
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,640
At a certain age, they lose that.

109
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,178
What?

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,681
That glow of pure youth.

111
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,309
It's like they hit 30,
and somebody puts out a light.

112
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,385
I don't think those two
have 30 years between them.

113
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,585
Polka dots looks like a lot of fun.

114
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,895
Yeah, you'll have to let me know.

115
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,531
Jesus, you must be starving.

116
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,968
I know I am. What's Betty making?

117
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,437
I don't know.

118
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,977
Mona hasn't cooked since
Margaret stopped eating.

119
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,705
They're fighting it out.
I'm the one that gets hurt.

120
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,147
I'll call Betty. Tell her we'll be three.

121
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,621
No!

122
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,522
- You sure?
- Are you kidding?

123
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,390
She'll be thrilled.

124
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,691
When's the last time she saw you?

125
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,789
We'll take my car.
Save you train fare.

126
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,412
- My eyes are burning.
- That's impossible.

127
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,819
That better not be Daddy
saying he's going to be late.

128
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,685
Don't do gymnastics in the house.

129
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,193
<i>Draper residence.</i>

130
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,994
<i>You are coming home, right?</i>

131
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,535
Yes. I'm coming home.

132
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,970
Unfortunately, Roger has decided
he needs a home-cooked meal.

133
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,099
You're kidding.

134
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,972
I don't know if I have enough food.

135
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,239
Birdie, what do you put in
that freezer I bought you?

136
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,909
Frozen food.

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,041
What do you want me to say?

138
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,163
Betty, this steak...

139
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,327
You sure you don't want some?

140
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,234
No, thank you, Roger.

141
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,534
I'm a vegetarian sometimes.

142
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,906
Mona has a little calorie book
she keeps on the refrigerator.

143
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,639
Always has her nose in there.

144
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,408
Maybe she wants
to look good for you.

145
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,075
Isn't that a nice thought?

146
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,244
I was pudgy as a girl, if you can believe it.

147
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,878
I came into Home Ec in the 8th grade

148
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,388
with a pattern for big girl pajamas.

149
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,392
The teacher asked who I was
making the pajamas for.

150
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,725
I didn't realize how much
weight I'd lost that summer.

151
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,889
Swim camp, I guess.

152
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,024
I went from Tadpole to Polliwog that year.

153
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,603
Sounds like a lateral move.

154
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,797
When I was little, in the summer
we used to swim at night.

155
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,101
In a pool, not the ocean.

156
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,197
Warm air,

157
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,278
light dancing in the blue...

158
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,575
Night swimming. It's divine.

159
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,513
Sometimes naked.

160
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,451
Believe me, on those nights,
it was very difficult to go to sleep.

161
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,146
You ever experienced that, Don?

162
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,656
Trouble sleeping? Never.

163
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,817
Your husband's a funny son of a bitch,
you know that, Betty?

164
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,588
Yeah.

165
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,323
We used to swim in a quarry.

166
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,396
By the way you drop your G's
every once in a while,

167
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,765
I always thought
you were raised on a farm.

168
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,997
Someplace with a swimmin' hole.

169
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,975
What do you say we go
to a commercial break...

170
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,208
brought to you by more liquor?

171
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,883
You two.

172
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,253
Oh. Jesus, don't tell me
it's your anniversary.

173
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,885
- No.
- Don't worry.

174
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,521
Sally got this frosting machine.

175
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,600
Oh. "Mommy and Daddy. "

176
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,497
Simple, to the point, colloquial.

177
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,832
She writes like her father.

178
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,603
I'll get hers. You get your own.

179
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,113
Three on a match.

180
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,316
Never understood that.

181
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,752
Is that like three on a horse?

182
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,416
Trench war. First war.

183
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,427
They used to say,
"First man lights up, they notice you.

184
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,860
"Second man, Jerry takes aim.

185
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,989
<i>Third one... Auf wiedersehen. "</i>

186
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,499
But the professional wisdom
says that one of our guys

187
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,467
came up with that,
as a way to sell matches.

188
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,038
You tell your kids there's no Santa Claus?

189
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,370
He'd never do that.

190
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,773
Tell us another story.
A true one, though.

191
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:27,276
Well, my father was in the trenches.

192
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,115
With a bayonet.

193
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,114
Think about that.

194
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,193
Poking a man to death
three feet away from you.

195
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,597
What does that sound like?

196
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,462
Don never talks about the war.

197
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,762
The war? His war, you mean.

198
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,531
Not much to say.

199
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,539
You boys used up all the glory.

200
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,041
We did, didn't we?

201
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,705
'Course, my old man will always
have one on me with that bayonet.

202
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,181
My biggest hit came
when we were running oil

203
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,252
down to the islands
in the South China Sea.

204
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,116
The Pacific was all about gasoline.

205
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,985
People forget that.

206
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,151
You know what?
I don't like to talk about it, either.

207
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,592
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

208
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,598
Not much.

209
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,602
Now you have to tell us.

210
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,539
Well, the third day we picked up
a Dinah circling the convoy.

211
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,612
A recon plane.

212
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,682
They were mapping us for the Nip suicide
submarines up ahead...

213
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:35,243
<i>kaitens... basically, warheads with motors.</i>

214
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,822
Made us feel good to know we had
such a dedicated enemy.

215
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,550
That's one way of thinking about it.

216
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,820
Maybe I was bored, but I thought,
We should get that little plane.

217
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,761
Bored? What about scared?

218
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,458
That never comes in to these stories.

219
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,694
You're making me look bad
in front of the lady.

220
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,966
That's impossible. Finish your story.

221
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,266
Well, we gave it to 'em.

222
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,174
Right at 12:00.

223
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,110
He was going away from us,
but we hit him.

224
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,047
I watched him dive into the waves
just beyond the horizon.

225
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,144
It was strange, because
we knew it was over for him,

226
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,485
but we didn't see or hear much.

227
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,050
The next four hours,
I took us off course, just to swing by.

228
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,790
Looking for a hole
in the ocean, I guess.

229
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,664
We saw the wreckage.
No chute, no body.

230
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,505
It's incredible that something
that heavy can float.

231
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,510
Isn't that something?

232
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,841
- Bet they gave you a medal.
- They did.

233
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,278
But not for that. It was for drinking.

234
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,981
Can something be done
about this sadness?

235
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,814
Want to switch to gin?

236
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,390
Did you check the golf bag?

237
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,552
I have something out in the garage
left over from New Year's.

238
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,890
I don't care if it has ants in it.

239
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,433
Roger, please, the kids.

240
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,409
Sally will be happy
her cake was such a hit.

241
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,849
Make sure you tell her

242
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,513
I ate the "M" in "Mom. "

243
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,523
- Roger...
- I can't believe you've had two babies.

244
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,724
Don't do that.

245
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,263
You've been making eyes at me all night.

246
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,799
You can't tell me that I'm
not giving you hot pants.

247
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,161
You smell so good.

248
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,804
I can make more coffee.

249
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,207
I just want you to know
that when I go to sleep tonight,

250
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,938
I will be thinking all about you.

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,425
Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?

252
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,794
No, I ran down the street
knocking on doors.

253
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,106
Come on, you two. Come on out here
and wish me a bon voyage.

254
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,807
I was just saying
what a lucky man you are.

255
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,181
Beautiful children. Enjoy it.

256
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,714
One minute you're drinking at a bar,

257
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,585
and they come and tell you
your kid's been born,

258
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,818
next thing you know,
they're heading off to college.

259
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,733
Well, I should be on my way.

260
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,701
I'll take this for the road.

261
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,398
I'll walk you out.

262
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,283
Magical night.

263
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,658
That's my car.

264
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,196
There you go.

265
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,899
Lights!

266
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,919
- What was that?
- What?

267
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,115
That. Him.

268
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,990
Felt like someone turned the oven on
when I came back in here with that bottle.

269
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,290
- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.

270
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,092
Nothing happened, Don.

271
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,667
Other than your drunk boss
ruining our evening.

272
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,736
Can we leave it at that?

273
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,896
You seemed to be having a grand time.

274
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,741
I liked the wine.

275
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,401
You made a fool of yourself.

276
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,536
Why would you say that?

277
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,012
You were throwing yourself at him.
Giggling at his stories.

278
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,346
I was being friendly. He's your boss.

279
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,079
I don't like to be treated that way
in my own home.

280
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,047
I know what I saw.

281
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,024
You want to bounce me off the walls?

282
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,191
Would that make you feel better?

283
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,636
Sometimes I feel like
I'm living with a little girl.

284
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,384
Humps, where were you last night?

285
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:43,394
I had a dinner with my in-laws
at the Four Seasons... poolside.

286
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,725
Sounds refreshing.

287
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,061
Norman Mailer, Mayor Wagner.

288
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,692
The naked and the dead.

289
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,271
- What's in the box?
- It's a wedding present.

290
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,670
- We got two.
- But what is it?

291
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,265
- It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
- Let me see.

292
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,708
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

293
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,370
I'm might have to go
to somebody else's wedding.

294
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,947
I like to know what people are returning.

295
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,552
What?

296
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,557
I don't know what to say.
You got two of these?

297
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,150
- What is it?
- You have your fingers in your ears?

298
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,559
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.
You have your friends over.

299
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,189
You put chips on the sides
and dip in the middle.

300
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,598
- Dip?
- Yes.

301
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,500
We went to these peoples' house,
and they had one.

302
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,870
It had sour cream with these
little brown onions in it.

303
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,272
It was very good.

304
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,742
You'll have to give me
that recipe sometime.

305
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,108
Cost 22 bucks.

306
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,183
- Shit!
- So.

307
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,807
I'm going to return it.

308
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,648
Today? Freddy Rumsen's
cousin works at General Mills.

309
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,381
We're all going to Ratazzi's for lunch.

310
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,981
- Maybe dinner.
- No.

311
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,687
- I have to return this thing.
- "Today," she said, I'm sure.

312
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,491
I like doing things for her.

313
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,122
You're right. I'm sorry.

314
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,827
When you finish shopping,
come join us.

315
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,029
I hear they make a great
Grasshopper, Mildred.

316
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,608
<i>Mr. Draper? Mr. Sterling to see you.</i>

317
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,424
Send him in.

318
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,593
Something for the golf bag.

319
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,094
That's the good stuff.

320
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,901
I take it you got home in one piece.

321
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,672
I made it as far as the Knights Inn
off the Taconic.

322
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,180
I know that place.
It's got great water pressure.

323
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,877
Yeah, I slept in the car.

324
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,282
About last night.

325
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,015
What about it?

326
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,057
When a man gets to the point
when his name's on the building,

327
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,652
he can get an unnatural
sense of entitlement.

328
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,425
What does that mean, Roger?

329
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,092
You're not gonna make this easy.

330
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,261
I don't even know what this is.

331
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,540
One night, years ago,
I got very drunk.

332
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,338
I drive home to my building,

333
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,242
pull into the garage, park at my spot.

334
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,372
I get in the elevator.

335
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,881
It's late. There's no operator.

336
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,179
Go up to the 12th floor. Get out.

337
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,810
I'm walking down the hall.

338
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,082
It's pink and orange.

339
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,182
I remember how ugly it was.

340
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,761
Suddenly, my key
won't fit in the door.

341
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,728
Wasn't my building.

342
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,968
I guess what I'm saying is, uh...

343
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,007
at some point, we've all
parked in the wrong garage.

344
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,342
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.

345
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,846
And?

346
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,479
Betty's going to want that glass back.

347
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,054
Good man.

348
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,753
Maybe I should get a case of those, huh?

349
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,937
This is taking a long time.

350
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,572
Is it that complicated?

351
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,413
Ah, the blue box.
You must be a newlywed.

352
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,918
That explains it.

353
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,216
Yes, it does. Adorable.

354
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,656
My husband, he'd rather
be drinking at lunch,

355
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,421
even when we were newlyweds, I think.

356
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,825
He's in advertising.

357
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,726
I'm in advertising. Sterling Cooper.

358
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,129
He's at BBDO. Media buyer.

359
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,258
Jim Wallace.

360
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,494
Don't know him.

361
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,197
That's because you're here at lunch.

362
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,672
Next.

363
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm here to return this.

364
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,104
There's nothing wrong with it.

365
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,735
We got two.

366
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,043
That's why we suggest that people register,
to avoid duplications.

367
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,913
We did register. We got two.

368
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,645
Do you have your receipt?

369
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,017
It was a gift.

370
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,091
Rosemary, we have a bridal return.

371
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,318
Him?

372
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,088
Bridal registry.

373
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,962
It's a Chip 'n' Dip. We got two.

374
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,501
That's practically four of something.

375
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,763
Name?

376
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:20,838
Campbell.

377
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,497
I suppose you don't have a receipt.

378
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,131
Gosh, I wish I did.

379
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,506
No. It was a gift.

380
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,475
There's nothing here.

381
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,516
Perhaps your wife told you
she was registering

382
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,312
and in the end forgot
to give us her name.

383
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,511
Her name?

384
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,520
Yes. It's under the maiden name.

385
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,249
Hmm. It's Vogel.

386
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,155
Why would you do that?

387
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,385
I don't know.

388
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,822
Humps.

389
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,490
Humps the Camel Campbell.

390
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,227
Matherton. What are you doing here?

391
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,303
Getting my racquet restrung.

392
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,928
Men's room back this way?

393
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,234
Down the hall past the water fountain.

394
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,434
What are you doing here?

395
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,067
Returning a wedding gift.

396
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,941
Not mine, I hope.

397
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,107
No, it's a Chip 'n' Dip. Trudy's aunt.

398
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,584
That's Trudy Vogel. Do you mind, lovely?

399
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:09,745
Uh, what is it?

400
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,755
It's a Chip 'n' Dip.

401
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,384
You put chips on the side
and dip in the middle.

402
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,257
For entertaining.

403
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,693
It's a beaut.

404
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,355
Hell of a wedding, by the way.

405
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,400
Your cousin Bethany...
bridesmaid's bridesmaid.

406
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,264
Connecticut College for Women, indeed.

407
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,169
I think I found it.

408
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,805
That's nice.

409
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,039
Good to see you.
We should do this sometime.

410
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,809
I'm coming back for you.

411
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,411
Do you have a receipt?

412
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,752
No. I might have already said that.

413
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,121
It was a gift.

414
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,591
I can give you store credit.

415
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,888
I was expecting cash.

416
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,226
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,129
Isn't there a way we could work this out?

418
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,225
Let me by you a drink.

419
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,361
I have an expense account.

420
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,632
The best I can do is put
the store credit in your name

421
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,005
so you can spend it here.

422
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,080
I would think about spending it on you
if you gave me cash.

423
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,170
It's $22.

424
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,375
Store credit.

425
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,979
Thank you.

426
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,321
By the way, Matherton...

427
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,361
he has the clap.

428
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,067
Same price as a Chip 'n' Dip.

429
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,306
Amazing.

430
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,978
And I was going to try
to make you feel bad

431
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,944
by telling you where
Carlotta's stockings end.

432
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,709
What the hell is that for?

433
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,283
It's for me.

434
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,352
.22 caliber bolt action.

435
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,284
Use it in good health.

436
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,151
Why not?

437
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,384
Boys will be boys, right?

438
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,361
You couldn't hit the side
of St. Patrick's with that.

439
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,900
It's good for 20 yards.

440
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,816
It's your 4:30, Mr. Campbell.

441
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,930
The Nixon brain trust
is coming in tomorrow.

442
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,523
The nomination is expected as a lock.

443
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,262
All we need is an opponent.

444
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,396
Rumor is Lyndon Johnson's
going to be making a play at the Convention,

445
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,736
so we may not be going
against Kennedy at all.

446
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,241
Then we have to worry
about the South.

447
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,174
It's going to be Kennedy.

448
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,442
Boston Blackie won West Virginia.

449
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,574
Now, where does that leave us?

450
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,744
"Nixon: Experience in office,
knows foreign affairs. "

451
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,946
He probably learned that

452
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,956
when they were throwing
rocks at him in Caracas.

453
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,822
"Knows the real threat of communism,
home and abroad. "

454
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,954
He's not helping himself
keeping quiet on Castro.

455
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,395
True, but he's not a Catholic.

456
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,796
Our hands are tied there.

457
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,767
Nixon thinks hitting
the Catholic thing is a bad idea.

458
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,428
They're going to say that.

459
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,698
To us? They believe it.

460
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,865
It hasn't held up
in any of the primaries.

461
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,205
Kennedy keeps making
opponents apologize.

462
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,710
For what?

463
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,279
For being intolerant.

464
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,642
This is Dick Nixon we're talking about.

465
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,908
You may be too young to remember

466
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,077
the "pink lady" congress... woman
from California.

467
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,314
He practically shot her in the face to win.

468
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,183
If it is Kennedy,

469
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,624
Nixon will lower himself
to the occasion.

470
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,457
It's going to be Kennedy.

471
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,054
Good. Catholic son of a millionaire.

472
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,397
A boy too scared to do anything
but go on vacation.

473
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,403
I met him. He is a boy.

474
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,699
He's only four years
younger than Nixon.

475
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,275
But has he been sitting
next to the leader of the free world

476
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,274
for twice that time?

477
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,776
He's inexperienced.

478
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,402
He doesn't even wear a hat.

479
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,447
I don't know.

480
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,642
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?

481
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,945
Elvis.

482
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,646
That's what we're dealing with.

483
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,389
Remind me to stop
hiring young people.

484
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,018
America does not want
some greasy kid

485
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,121
with his finger on the button.

486
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,632
Now if the adults can weigh in?

487
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,301
"Communism, taxes, health care. "

488
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,904
Kinsey, you want to write this down,
or should I call a girl in?

489
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,494
Hi, honey. I made a roast beef.

490
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,358
Just cut the strings.

491
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,760
Oh, roast beef?

492
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,363
You know it's just me tonight, right?

493
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,044
That was a wedding gift
from my Aunt Letty!

494
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,985
And you go and get some stupid toy?

495
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,283
I can't believe you!

496
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,290
That was for us!

497
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,121
You're always telling me to grow up.

498
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,127
I can't believe you!

499
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,558
Oh, I can leave it there?

500
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,566
Thanks.

501
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,795
Great. Thank you.

502
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,658
Hollis, let me ask you something.

503
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,506
Uh, Mr. Campbell,

504
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,910
I thought I'd take you up on your offer
to look at my work.

505
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,675
But if you're in the middle of something...

506
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,380
What's that?

507
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,958
A wedding present.

508
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,692
I really appreciate it.

509
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,258
You ever been hunting, Peggy?

510
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,426
No, I don't think so.

511
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,595
You either have or you haven't.

512
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,503
I went a couple of times with my uncle.

513
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,734
New Hampshire.

514
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,306
I saw my cousin shoot a rabbit
by Coney Island.

515
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,246
It's an incredible sensation.

516
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,217
You have to be very quiet.

517
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,750
Take it down with the first shot,

518
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,350
or you scare it away.

519
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,693
And sometimes you have to go up
and finish it off.

520
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,934
Then you tie it to the bumper,
and you go home.

521
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,234
But you know what I've
always wanted to do?

522
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,605
I would pick it up...

523
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,908
throw its back legs over my shoulder,

524
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:22,316
and I would drag it through the snow
to this little cabin.

525
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,411
And there...

526
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,183
I'd hang it up...

527
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,226
between a couple of trees,

528
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,056
cut it open,

529
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,390
drain it,

530
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,159
dress it,

531
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,131
and then I'd take
my big hunting knife,

532
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,763
and I'd cut this loin
right out of the side.

533
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,638
And I'd go into the cabin,

534
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,910
and there'd be this woman
waiting for me,

535
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,611
standing by one of those old stoves

536
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,278
with a big black pipe,

537
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,980
and I'd hand it to her,

538
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,218
and she'd put it in a cast-iron skillet,

539
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,854
and then I'd sit at the table...

540
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,592
and she'd bring it to me.

541
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,230
And I'd wipe my knife on my knee...

542
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,669
and then I would eat it
while she watches.

543
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,340
That would be wonderful.

544
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,650
I'll take a look at this for you.

545
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,155
Thank you.

546
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,686
Can I get a ham sandwich?

547
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,891
You know what?
I'll take a cherry Danish.

548
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,256
The big one in the back.

549
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,965
Thank you, ma'am. There you go.

550
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,422
Helen. Hello.

551
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,691
Hi, Betty.

552
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,164
How are you?

553
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,290
I'm well.

554
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,529
And how's Glen?

555
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,370
I wasn't going to say anything.

556
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,603
I was just going to go right on by.

557
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,476
What's wrong?

558
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,244
I was going...

559
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,821
I was going through Glen's
treasure box the other day,

560
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,449
and I found a lock of blonde hair.

561
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,027
Your hair, he says.

562
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,653
Well, I don't know what he told you.

563
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,061
Glen doesn't lie, not when he's caught.

564
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,928
- I'm not saying it's a lie.
- Betty.

565
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,332
He asked me for it.

566
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,801
And you gave it to him?

567
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,667
He is 9 years old.

568
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,033
What is wrong with you?

569
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,715
He was a bold man
that first ate an oyster.

570
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,125
I believe that was Jonathan Swift.

571
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,788
Are we naming them now?

572
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,900
Look at you.

573
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,730
I had no idea you were
such a fan of the mollusk.

574
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:04,502
Never gave them a chance before,
but I'm acquiring a taste.

575
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,440
It's like eating a mermaid.

576
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:12,412
Ready for another,
or have you topped off your tank?

577
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,246
You're leading this dance.

578
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,344
Well, what the hell? It's the G.O.P.

579
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,855
They'll never smell it
over the stench of Brylcreem.

580
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,552
Another round.

581
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,560
Wait. Are you still good with these,

582
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,391
or do you prefer your beloved rye?

583
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,091
Today I'm on the Roger Sterling diet.

584
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,534
Easy on the vermouth,
another dozen of these.

585
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,538
Me, as well.

586
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,307
I've always thought you were
a man who could keep up, Don.

587
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,362
Anything else, gentlemen?

588
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,331
Did you know
they served cheesecake

589
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,459
to the Olympic athletes
in ancient Greece?

590
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,937
So what's an extra lap or two
around the steno pool for us?

591
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,302
Two cheesecakes.

592
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,343
And don't let me see
the bottom of this glass.

593
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,447
What were we talking about?

594
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,879
Oh, yes, the Russians.

595
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,349
Shooting those dogs into space.

596
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,321
I believe we branded them cat lovers
and moved on to the subject of true love.

597
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,393
Right. Desi and Lucy... please.

598
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,189
He's divorcing her again.

599
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,731
Did he wake up one morning and say
"Oh, yeah, I forgot, I hate you"?

600
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,034
What makes a man marry
the same woman twice?

601
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,935
I believe in his case,

602
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,870
it was the lure of orange hair.

603
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,102
I like redheads.

604
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:52,876
Their mouths are like a drop
of strawberry jam in a glass of milk.

605
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,182
I think I woke my ulcer up.

606
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,190
Drinking milk.

607
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,522
I never liked it.

608
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,118
I hate cows.

609
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,694
You keep matching me like this,

610
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,364
you'll have an ulcer
of your own, any day now.

611
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,176
One more?

612
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,643
Instead of coffee?

613
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,008
Sure.

614
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,843
But then we should get the check.

615
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,135
Hey, Birdie. I have the shirt.

616
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,902
What is this?

617
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,738
Bobby spilled some Concord grape juice
down the front of it.

618
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,038
I washed it.

619
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,582
Uh, this is Ernie's shirt, not Bobby's.

620
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,651
Well, what do you know?

621
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,414
Oh, did you have a party
you didn't invite me to?

622
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:08,515
I'll invite you. It's going to be a dinner party.

623
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,491
I'm just trying the wine, you know.

624
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,995
Develop my palate.

625
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,655
Do you want some? It's a split.

626
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,528
There's another glass.

627
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,226
How are you?

628
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,826
I'm good.

629
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,637
Maybe I will try some.

630
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,774
Betty,

631
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,545
Jill Sandifer was
in the market earlier today.

632
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,314
What?

633
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,321
Is it true?

634
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,890
You're my friend, Francine.

635
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,391
Are you coming over here to do recon?

636
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,983
I'm worried about you.

637
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,031
I don't know what happened.

638
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,474
I kept thinking in the car
on the way back,

639
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,877
"Did that really happen?"

640
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,778
And...

641
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,475
then I just put it out of my mind.

642
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,450
Well, what did happen?

643
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,180
Whatever you heard.

644
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,384
I mean, I don't even want to hear it.

645
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,485
I have my own version,
and it's plenty.

646
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,654
It's okay.

647
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,822
Honestly, I don't know anyone

648
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,161
who wouldn't want
to take a good poke at her.

649
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,529
She's so selfish.

650
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,102
Those long walks

651
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,969
and that pathetic job
at Benson's Jewelry.

652
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,565
Carlton went in there
to buy me some earrings.

653
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,441
I'm sure she loved that.

654
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,377
When I saw the Benson's Jewelry
wrapping paper,

655
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,415
I almost threw it in his face.

656
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,112
And that John Kennedy. I hate him.

657
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,710
Really?

658
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,351
What will people think?

659
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,689
I think they'll be glad
to know you're not a marshmallow.

660
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,423
Do people think I'm weak?

661
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,557
No. It's just you're so sweet and perfect.

662
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,964
I'm not.

663
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,866
Well, it does seem that way.

664
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,165
Look, it'll all be forgotten.

665
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,333
We don't have to include
Helen Bishop anymore.

666
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,934
Let her know
whose side we're all on.

667
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,075
Uh, my mother...

668
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,742
always said,

669
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,343
"You're painting a masterpiece.

670
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,551
Make sure to hide the brushstrokes. "

671
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,593
She was really beautiful.

672
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,892
Then I think, um...

673
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,592
"Why am I doing all this? I'm not that vain. "

674
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,760
What does Dr. Wayne say?

675
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,462
Nothing...

676
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,939
except "Tell me more about that. "

677
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,738
I'm still dying to try it.

678
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:47,409
I'm pretty sure Dr. Wayne tried
to look down my neckline the other day.

679
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,008
He sits behind me.

680
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,851
And as far as I'm concerned,
as long as men look at me that way,

681
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:56,859
I'm earning my keep.

682
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,293
Then every once in a while,

683
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,093
I think...

684
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,190
No.

685
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,737
This is something else.

686
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,272
I don't want my husband to see this.

687
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,034
I love to be looked at that way.

688
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,314
You should get out of here.

689
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,181
Nap time is about to end.

690
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,352
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.

691
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,021
We haven't gone over the Nixon plan.

692
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,599
You prepared, right?

693
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,429
In what way?

694
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,730
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

695
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,737
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Draper,
I'm waiting for service.

696
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,670
So am I. What are you talking about?

697
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,934
We're out of order.

698
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,442
Oh, crap.

699
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,604
When will they be back up?
Should we wait?

700
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,681
We've got our best man on it.

701
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,444
That's a comfort.

702
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,486
Jesus, we're already late.

703
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,077
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling.

704
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,714
It's certainly a believable excuse.

705
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,156
We could go back to lunch.

706
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,457
No. Cooper would have a seizure,
if he hasn't already.

707
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,532
So?

708
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,887
Ah, this is ridiculous. A building this big.

709
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,153
What if there was a fire?

710
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,786
We'd be walking down.

711
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,023
It would be easier.

712
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,039
Maybe we should check the elevator.

713
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,373
Maybe it's up again.

714
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,347
I think we'd hear it go on in the stairwell.

715
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,644
You think?

716
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,582
Roger, I don't know.

717
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,984
Maybe they're late, too.

718
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,852
Maybe we could get them to come down

719
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,982
and have the presentation
on the eighth floor landing.

720
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:09,991
There's plenty of seats.

721
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,254
Damned elevator.

722
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,489
What do you want to do?
We're almost there.

723
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,894
The hell we are.

724
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,435
Well, we can waste another five minutes
talking about it, if you want.

725
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,969
Let's go.

726
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,506
Get behind me with that thing.

727
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,886
Six to go.

728
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,789
I've been counting.

729
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,361
You want to rest a minute?

730
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,831
No, sir. No, I don't.

731
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,732
Keep moving.

732
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,430
I forgot. Navy man.

733
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,347
I love redheads.

734
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,915
With big breasts.

735
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,786
We'll find you one if we still have jobs.

736
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,224
Want me to run ahead?

737
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,421
Run?

738
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,760
My name's on the building.

739
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,423
They can wait for me.

740
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,967
I got to stop talking.

741
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,245
I'm fine.

742
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,325
Just lost my tie clip.

743
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,653
I'll find it. Go on.

744
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,749
You sure?

745
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,227
I said go on.

746
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,402
Found it!

747
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,461
- Where the hell were you?
- Elevator's out.

748
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,190
- That's quite a hike. Where's Sterling?
- He's coming.

749
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,895
Well, here are the troops now.

750
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,334
Lou, Michael, Charlie, uh, Don Draper.

751
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,336
Hey, Don.

752
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,202
Our creative muscle.

753
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,207
Hopefully, a little brains, too.

754
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,640
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting.

755
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,234
The elevator's out.

756
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,745
Pete Campbell, of course.

757
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,939
We've spoken on the phone.

758
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,346
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,908
He'll continue handling things for you.

760
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,750
And when I say handling,
I mean he runs everything by me.

761
00:44:55,926 --> 00:45:00,727
And, of course, uh,
my partner, Roger Sterling.

762
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,430
We heard the elevator's down.

763
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,060
Those boys over at United Fruit

764
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,935
talk about you like you
invented the damn banana.

765
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

766
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,874
You all right, Roger?

767
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,142
Get us some ice water.

768
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,649
Oysters.

769
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,743
I can see that.

770
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,687
23 floors.

771
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,382
I'm just sorry I missed this lunch.

772
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,619
We were with some Quakers.
Had cottage cheese.

773
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,788
Well, let's let Roger regroup.

774
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,829
- Okay.
- Yeah.

775
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,559
This way.

776
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,362
I'll be right in.

777
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,338
You okay?

778
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,911
Yeah.

779
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,646
Fine.

780
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,785
Good.
