1
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,295
Finished, sir?

2
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,964
Yeah. Hey, do you have a light?

3
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,144
Old Gold man, huh?

4
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,247
Lucky Strike here.

5
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,455
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

6
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,890
I'm sorry, sir.
Is Sam here bothering you?

7
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,553
He can be a little chatty.

8
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,029
No, we're actually just
having a conversation.

9
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,030
Is that okay?

10
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,795
Can I get you another drink?

11
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,962
Yeah. Do this again.
Old-fashioned, please.

12
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,969
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

13
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,307
I guess. I don't know.

14
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,812
But what is it? I mean, low-tar?

15
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:55,812
Those new filters?

16
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,348
Why... I mean... Why Old Gold?

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,645
They gave 'em to us in the service...

18
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,242
a carton a week for free.

19
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,015
So you're used to 'em,
is that it?

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,819
Yeah. They're a habit.

21
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,825
I could never get you
to try another brand...

22
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,758
say, my Luckies?

23
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,991
I love my Old Golds.

24
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,694
All right, well, let's just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comes

25
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,772
and eats every last
Old Gold on the planet.

26
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,602
That's a sad story.

27
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,506
It's a tragedy.

28
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,044
Would you just stop smoking?

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,675
I think I could find something.

30
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,147
I love smoking.

31
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,776
"I love smoking. " That's very good.

32
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,514
My wife hates it.

33
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,681
<i>Reader's Digest says it will kill you.</i>

34
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,019
Yeah, I heard about that.

35
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,728
Ladies love their magazines.

36
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,264
Yes, they do.

37
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,891
You weren't worried
about waking me, were you?

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,331
Am I interrupting anything?

39
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,663
Mmm, no.

40
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:31,576
You're lucky I'm still up working
and I'm alone.

41
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,077
How's it going?

42
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,740
They invented something called
Grandmother's Day.

43
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,752
That ought to keep me busy
drawing puppies for a few months.

44
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,754
Can I run a few ideas past you?

45
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,687
Does that mean
what I think it means?

46
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,818
Because I'm familiar
with most of your ideas.

47
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,123
I'm having a situation
with my cigarette account.

48
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,632
Wow, you really are here to talk.

49
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,635
The Trade Commission is cracking down
on all of our health claims.

50
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,796
<i>I get Reader's Digest.</i>

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,397
This is the same scare
you had five years ago.

52
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,634
You dealt with it.

53
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,144
I know I slept a lot better
knowing doctors smoke.

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,179
Well, that's just it.

55
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,409
The whole "safer cigarette"
thing is over.

56
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,485
No more doctors,
no more testimonials,

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,987
no more cough-free,
soothes your T-zone,

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,149
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,817
Nothing.

60
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,521
All I have is a crush-proof box

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,157
and "four out of five
dead people smoke your brand. "

62
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,825
Is this the part where I say,

63
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,927
"Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,

64
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,973
"and his big, strong brain will find a way

65
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,235
to lead the sheep
to the slaughterhouse"?

66
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,778
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

67
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,179
You gonna pitch to me or not?

68
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,912
Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing.

69
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,954
I am over, and they're
finally gonna know it.

70
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,113
Next time you see me,

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,713
there will be a bunch
of young executives

72
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,916
picking meat off my ribs.

73
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,256
That's a pretty picture.

74
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,992
What's your secret?

75
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,802
Nine different ways to say...

76
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,362
"I love you, Grandma. "

77
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,886
We should get married.

78
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,396
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?

79
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,898
I'm serious.

80
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,400
You have your own business.

81
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,233
You don't mind when I come over.

82
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,967
What size Cadillac do you take?

83
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,204
You know the rules.

84
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,471
I don't make plans,

85
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,911
and I don't make breakfast.

86
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:58,652
Sterling's having the tobacco people in
in nine hours, and I have nothing.

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,925
People love smoking.

88
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,088
There's nothing that you,
the Trade Commission,

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,429
<i>or Reader's Digest
can do to change that.</i>

90
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,938
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,943
looks where he's gonna put his plants.

92
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,408
Is he handsome?

93
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,801
23.

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,892
Uh, not right away.

95
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,631
Pal, could you take the long way up?

96
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,173
I am really enjoying the view here.

97
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,435
You going to Campbell's
bachelor party?

98
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,669
Yeah, I want to be there

99
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,804
before they tie an anchor around his neck
and drag him out to sea.

100
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,211
I hear she's a nice girl.

101
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,509
Eh, who wants that?

102
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,647
What did you do that for?

103
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,520
She'll probably be
assigned to one of us.

104
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,287
Then she'll know what she's in for.

105
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,453
You got to let them know
what kind of guy you are.

106
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,121
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.

107
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,098
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party soon.

108
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,466
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

109
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,970
Excuse me. Is he expecting you?

110
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,266
He's not expecting anything.

111
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,105
Oh, honey, don't worry.
I'll get home safely.

112
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,071
I have an important
appointment right now,

113
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,150
so why don't you go
shopping or something?

114
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,877
Take your mother to lunch.

115
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,316
Tell her it was my idea.

116
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,081
Wow. He's good.

117
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,249
It's just a bachelor party, dear.

118
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,918
No, I really don't know
what they have planned,

119
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,223
but judging from the creative brain power
around here,

120
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,389
<i>we'll probably end up
seeing My Fair Lady.</i>

121
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,967
I'll tell you what.

122
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,900
I'll drop by your place on my way home.

123
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,369
Your mother can check
under my fingernails.

124
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,837
Of course I love you.

125
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,004
I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?

126
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,916
What a great gal.

127
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,551
Tell ya, boys,

128
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,282
she stole my heart.

129
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,017
And her old man's loaded.

130
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,389
Now, this is the executive floor.

131
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,488
It should be organized, but it's not,

132
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,831
so you'll find account executives
and creative executives all mixed in together.

133
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,198
Please don't ask me the difference.

134
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,202
Great.

135
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,863
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,

136
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,908
you can avoid some of the mistakes
I've made here.

137
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,670
- Hello, Joan.
- Like that one.

138
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,314
So how many trains did it take you?

139
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,382
Only one, but I got up very early.

140
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,041
In a couple of years,
with the right moves,

141
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,142
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.

142
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,983
Of course, if you really make
the right moves,

143
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,147
you'll be out in the country,

144
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,021
and you won't be going to work at all.

145
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,650
You'll be here just
across the aisle from me.

146
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,229
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper
for the time being.

147
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,663
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

148
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,826
Keep a fifth of something
in your desk.

149
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,494
Mr. Draper drinks rye.

150
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,664
Also, invest in some
aspirin, Band-Aids,

151
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,708
and a needle and thread.

152
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,741
Rye is Canadian, right?

153
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,539
You better find out.

154
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,245
He may act like he wants a secretary,

155
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,576
but most of the time,

156
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,516
they're looking for something
between a mother and a waitress.

157
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,246
And the rest of the time, well...

158
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,188
Go home, take a paper bag,

159
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,853
and cut some eyeholes out of it.

160
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,692
Put it over your head, get undressed,

161
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,459
and look at yourself in the mirror.

162
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,695
Really evaluate where your strengths
and weaknesses are,

163
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,202
and be honest.

164
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,296
I always try to be honest.

165
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,136
Good for you.

166
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,103
Now, try not to be overwhelmed
by all this technology.

167
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,201
It looks complicated,

168
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,010
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

169
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,208
I sure hope so.

170
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,445
At lunch, pick up a box of chocolates,

171
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,180
a dozen carnations,
and some bath salts.

172
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,220
I'll explain later.

173
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,790
Thank you, Miss Holloway.

174
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,382
You're really wonderful
for looking out for me this way.

175
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,926
It's Joan.

176
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,825
And listen,

177
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,591
don't take this the wrong way,

178
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,566
but a girl like you,
with those darling little ankles,

179
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,465
I'd find a way to make 'em sing.

180
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,403
Also, men love scarves.

181
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,997
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

182
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,671
Oh! And Mr. Sterling. How are you?

183
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,746
Morning, girls.

184
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,517
You look like a hundred bucks.
Long night?

185
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,144
It's not this tobacco thing, is it?

186
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,687
It's been on my mind.

187
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,256
Yeah, well, I should hope so.

188
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,416
Lee Garner, his father,

189
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,425
the whole Lucky Strike family
will be here at 4.

190
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,820
You worried?

191
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,262
No.

192
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,197
If I was worried,
I'd ask you what you've got,

193
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,134
but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume
you've got something,

194
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,205
which means you should be worried.

195
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,774
So you came here because you wanted
to watch me get dressed?

196
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,435
No, I wanted to make sure
you were here.

197
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:49,446
In body. Give me about a half hour
for the rest of it.

198
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,610
How do I put this?

199
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,186
Have we ever hired any Jews?

200
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,652
Not on my watch.

201
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,623
That's very funny. It's not what I meant.

202
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,956
We've got an Italian.
Salvatore, my art director.

203
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,189
- That won't work.
- Sorry.

204
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,322
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

205
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,627
Yeah, I know.

206
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,133
Selling Jewish products to Jewish people.

207
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,464
That's very good.

208
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,731
It's just that our 11:00
is with Menken's Department Store

209
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,036
and I wish we had someone
to make them feel... comfortable.

210
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,771
You want me to run
down to the deli and grab somebody?

211
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,373
You missed a button.

212
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,688
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.

213
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,231
Still trying to fill out that bikini?

214
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,062
Summer's coming.

215
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,295
Without the medical claims,

216
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:23,398
all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.

217
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,033
My neighbor posed for that.

218
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,477
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed.

219
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,980
Of course, he doesn't smoke.

220
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,174
Had him hold a pencil.

221
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,047
If I know these guys,
you're better off with a little sex appeal.

222
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,053
Can you give me a woman
in a bathing suit,

223
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,247
put her next to your guy?

224
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,483
A sexy girl? I can do that.

225
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,219
Give you a chance
to get a real model.

226
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,625
Oh, I love my work.

227
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,219
Speaking of sexy girls,

228
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,128
are you going to Pete's bachelor party?

229
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,894
I'm not really big on those things.

230
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,401
Tell me about it. It's so embarrassing.

231
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,062
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,

232
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,163
I want to be alone so I can do something.

233
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,639
Should we drink before
the meeting or after?

234
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,077
Or both?

235
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,742
So... that's it, huh? Relax?

236
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,409
Don't be short with me.

237
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,919
You're the writer.

238
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,319
I thought it was worth a try.

239
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,152
<i>Greta Guttman is here to see you.</i>

240
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,157
Send her in.

241
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,352
Oh, great.

242
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,520
Now we get to hear from our man in research.

243
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,096
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,

244
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,602
you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected.

245
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,298
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

246
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,204
I'm doing my own research.

247
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,277
If you're planning to continue
with medical testimony,

248
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,438
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

249
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,776
We must police ourselves.

250
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,645
- There's your slogan.
- The medical thing is dead.

251
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,683
We understand that.

252
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,946
Yes, dead. An apt choice of words,

253
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,182
considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

254
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,724
If we can't insist that they're not,

255
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,420
I believe my most recent surveys
have provided a solution.

256
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,258
We can still suggest
that cigarettes are part of American life,

257
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,025
or too good to give up,

258
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,727
or, most appealing,
an assertion of independence.

259
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,066
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking.

260
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,503
We can put a skull
and crossbones on the label.

261
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,574
I love it.

262
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,302
Before the war,

263
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,207
when I studied with Adler in Vienna,

264
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,542
we postulated that what Freud called
the death wish

265
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,875
is as powerful a drive

266
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,507
as those for sexual reproduction
and physical sustenance.

267
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,643
Freud, you say?

268
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,720
What agency is he with?

269
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,484
So we're supposed to believe
that people are all living one way

270
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,719
and secretly thinking
the exact opposite?

271
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,317
That's ridiculous.

272
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,420
Let me tell you something,
Miss Guttman...

273
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,828
Doctor.

274
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,832
Dr. Guttman.

275
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,869
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

276
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,806
but it so happens that people were
buying cigarettes before Freud was born.

277
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,036
The issue here isn't
why should people smoke.

278
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,170
It's why should people
smoke Lucky Strike.

279
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,681
Suggesting that our customers have a...

280
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,513
What did you call it? A death wish?

281
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,485
I just don't see that on a billboard.

282
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,352
<i>So what if Reader's Digest
says they're dangerous?</i>

283
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,585
<i>They also said Bambi
was the book of the century.</i>

284
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,591
There's no proof.

285
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,321
There's conclusive proof

286
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,796
that none of these low-tar,
low-nicotine, or filtration systems

287
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,232
have any effect on the incidences
of lung cancer.

288
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,064
Just give me the damn report.

289
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,365
I think you'll find it very convincing.

290
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,770
I'm sure I will.

291
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,000
You're the one who found

292
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,077
all of our medical testimonials
in the first place.

293
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,371
That's true, Mr. Draper, but I...

294
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,969
Has anyone else seen this?

295
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,274
Of course not. It's your account.

296
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,644
Good.

297
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,214
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

298
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,788
I'm sorry. I just find your whole
approach perverse.

299
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,393
Good luck at the meeting.

300
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,553
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

301
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,136
Sal, I'll take that drink now.

302
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,672
Mr. Draper.

303
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,742
Excuse me.

304
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,974
Mr. Draper.

305
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,450
I'm sorry to wake you,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

306
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,280
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?

307
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,288
No, sir.

308
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,518
That's good.

309
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,524
Who are you?

310
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,027
I'm Peggy Olsen, the new girl.

311
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,196
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

312
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,139
I know it's my first day,
and I don't want to seem uncooperative,

313
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,939
but do I have to?

314
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,208
I see your point.

315
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,773
I brought you some aspirin.

316
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,783
Send him in.

317
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,386
You look like a hundred bucks.

318
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,359
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

319
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,056
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning, Pete.

320
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,530
I've never had any complaints.

321
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,567
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

322
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,397
She's the new girl.

323
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,335
You always get the new girl.

324
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,168
Management gets all the perks.

325
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,436
Where are you from, honey?

326
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,738
Miss Deaver's Secretarial School.

327
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,244
Top notch.

328
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,541
But I meant where are you from?

329
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,742
Are you Amish or something?

330
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,752
No. I'm from Brooklyn.

331
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,014
Well, you're in the city now.

332
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,090
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

333
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,716
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman.

334
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,590
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

335
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,458
Hey, I'm not done here.

336
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,622
I'm working my way up.

337
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,199
That will be all.

338
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,460
Peggy, right?

339
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,933
Yes.

340
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,527
Oh, and it's time for
your 11:00 meeting.

341
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,630
Oh, and sorry about Mr. Campbell here.

342
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,641
He left his manners
back at the fraternity house.

343
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,144
She's a little young for you, Draper.

344
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,114
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman.

345
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,207
When's the wedding again?

346
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,015
Sunday. Did Ken tell you
about the bachelor party tonight?

347
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,146
He sure did.

348
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,655
So do I get first crack at her?

349
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,283
<i>Word is she took down more sailors
than The Arizona.</i>

350
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,952
How old are you, Pete?

351
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,427
I just turned 26.

352
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,795
I bet the whole world looks like
one great big brassiere strap

353
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,060
just waiting to be snapped, huh?

354
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,500
You are good with words, Draper.

355
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,129
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

356
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,902
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

357
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,977
Advertising is a very small world,

358
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,444
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

359
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,175
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

360
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,944
you make it even smaller.

361
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:44,421
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,
you'll never run this place.

362
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,115
You'll die in that corner office,

363
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,216
a mid-level executive
with a little bit of hair

364
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,192
who women go home with out of pity.

365
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,924
Want to know why?

366
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,000
Because no one will like you.

367
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,368
Oh! Here are our miracle-workers now.

368
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,774
You know Pete Campbell, of course,

369
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,847
your account executive
if you choose to do business with us.

370
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,812
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,

371
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,076
the best creative director in New York.

372
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,311
Well, at least the building.
Pleasure to meet you.

373
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,610
Oop. Sorry about that.

374
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,781
I'm Rachel Menken.

375
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,382
Oh. Uh, sorry. I was expecting...

376
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,518
You were expecting me to be a man.

377
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,857
My father was, too.

378
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,024
And you are?

379
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,364
Why, Don, you remember David Cohen
from the art department.

380
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,099
Of course! David.

381
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,698
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

382
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,834
Well, why don't we make
ourselves comfortable?

383
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,038
And, Miss Menken, you can tell us
what you have in mind.

384
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,205
Wonderful.

385
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,683
That's very subtle.

386
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,809
Isn't that your shirt?

387
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,855
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found one.

388
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,513
So you must be Peggy Olsen.

389
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,147
Joan Holloway sent you over.

390
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,776
She's a great girl. How is Joan?

391
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,445
She sends her regards.

392
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,954
She's a lot of fun.

393
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,786
Must be a scream to work with her.

394
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
Yes, it's pretty terrific.

395
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,528
Try to make yourself comfortable.

396
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,656
Relax.

397
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:46,911
I see from your chart, and your finger,
that you're not married.

398
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,741
That's right.

399
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,645
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

400
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,243
Well, I was...

401
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,048
No reason to be nervous.

402
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,349
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you.

403
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,152
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

404
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,284
about the possibility of sexual activity.

405
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,691
Spread your knees.

406
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,460
That's good to hear.

407
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,294
Although, as a doctor,

408
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,664
I'd like to think that putting a woman
in this situation

409
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,261
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

410
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,432
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

411
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,779
I'll warn you now,

412
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,980
I will take you off this medicine if you abuse it.

413
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,716
It's for your own good, really.

414
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,590
But the fact is,
even in our modern times,

415
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,462
easy women don't find husbands.

416
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,602
I understand, Dr. Emerson.

417
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,070
I really am a very responsible person.

418
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,301
Well, I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl.

419
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,002
Now, Joan...

420
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,341
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed.

421
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,051
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid.

422
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,054
They're $11 a month,

423
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,624
but don't think you have to go out
and become the town pump

424
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,285
just to get your money's worth.

425
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,520
Excuse my French.

426
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,330
So what Don is saying
is that through a variety of media,

427
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,097
<i>including a spot during
The Danny Thomas Show,</i>

428
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,798
if you can afford it,
we could really boost awareness.

429
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,104
Then, a 10% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

430
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,144
will increase your first-time visitors.

431
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,974
Once we get them into the store,

432
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,847
the rest... is kind of up to you.

433
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,078
Mr. Draper, our store is 60 years old.

434
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,314
We share a wall with Tiffany's.

435
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,980
Honestly, a coupon?

436
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,820
Miss Menken, coupons work.

437
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,623
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

438
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,493
He might, but he's not here

439
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,193
because we just
had our lowest sales year ever.

440
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,465
So I suppose what I think
matters most right now.

441
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,240
Miss Menken, why did you come here?

442
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:02,211
There are a dozen other agencies
better suited to your... needs.

443
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,648
If I wanted some man who happened
to be from the same... village as my father

444
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,083
to manage my account,

445
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,414
I could have stayed where I was.

446
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,887
Their research favors coupons, too.

447
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,350
It's not just research, Miss Menken.

448
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,950
Housewives love coupons.

449
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,654
I'm not interested in housewives.

450
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,062
What kind of people do you want?

451
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,293
I want your kind of people, Mr. Draper:

452
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,926
People who don't care about coupons,

453
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,230
whether or not they can afford it.

454
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,738
People who are coming to the store
because it is expensive.

455
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,866
We obviously have very different ideas.

456
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,673
Yes, like the customer is always right?

457
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,739
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

458
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,614
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

459
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,915
Miss, you are way out of line.

460
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,954
Don, please.

461
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,318
Let's not get emotional here.

462
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,858
There's no reason
we can't talk this out.

463
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,722
Talk out what? This silly idea

464
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,058
that people are gonna come
to some store they've never been to

465
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,426
because it's more expensive?

466
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,829
It works for Chanel.

467
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,332
Menken's is not Chanel.

468
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,164
That's a vote of confidence.

469
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,999
What Don's saying is,

470
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,005
Chanel is a very different kind of place.

471
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,270
It's French, it's continental, it's...

472
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,140
Not just another
Jewish department store?

473
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,439
Exactly.

474
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,139
You were right, Roger.

475
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,648
This place really runs on charm.

476
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,446
- This is ridiculous.
- Don.

477
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,646
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

478
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,315
This meeting is over.
Good luck, Miss Menken.

479
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,565
Hey, Don, I don't blame you.

480
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,002
She was way out of line.

481
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,835
Adding money and education
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.

482
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,776
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you.

483
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,939
I'm not gonna pretend I don't want your job,
but you were right.

484
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,882
I'm not great with people, and you are.

485
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,453
I mean, not counting
that meeting we were just in.

486
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,785
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

487
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,916
There's plenty of room at the top.

488
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,390
Look, I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before.

489
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,798
It's just this damn tobacco thing.

490
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,995
You'll think of something.
A man like you

491
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,299
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,

492
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,805
and I wouldn't be the first.

493
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,273
Am I right, buddy?

494
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,636
Let's take it a little slower.

495
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,543
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

496
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,949
Fuck you.

497
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,121
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?

498
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,557
He seemed nice.

499
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,288
He has a place in South Hampton.

500
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,456
I'm not saying that I've seen it,
but it's beautiful.

501
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,158
Now, don't be nervous,

502
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,897
but this is the nerve center of the office.

503
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,406
You and your boss rely on the willing
and cheerful cooperation

504
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,442
of a few skilled employees.

505
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,947
Never snap, yell,
or be sarcastic with them.

506
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,176
And above all, always be a supplicant.

507
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,456
I know you girls are busy,
but we've got a new one.

508
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,051
Peggy, this is Marge, Nanette, and Ivy.

509
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,096
I brought you some things.

510
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,132
I guess a sort of
"getting to know you" gift.

511
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,400
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

512
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,369
If I know Joan, the candy's for me.

513
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,803
Joan, you're not fair.

514
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,273
You know she has to lose 8 pounds
by the Christmas party.

515
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,310
I think you look great.

516
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,346
Yeah, it's because I'm sitting down.

517
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,347
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

518
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,609
Who does she work for?

519
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,014
Don Draper.

520
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,312
They got rid of Eleanor?

521
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,944
She moved on.

522
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,955
Draper wasn't interested.

523
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,718
Well, she couldn't get a call through.

524
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,122
Rude little thing.

525
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,784
We see that you've got your hands full.

526
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,328
Don't want to be a bother.

527
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,328
Nice meeting you.

528
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,363
Hey, you have great legs.

529
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,864
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them

530
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,901
if he could see them.

531
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,197
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

532
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,404
I just don't know what we have to do
to make these government interlopers happy.

533
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,844
They tell us to make a safer cigarette,
we do it,

534
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,314
and then suddenly that's not good enough.

535
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,146
Might as well be living in Russia.

536
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,653
Damn straight.

537
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,584
You know, this morning I got a call

538
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,856
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson,

539
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,262
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

540
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,062
because of the health claims they made.

541
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,635
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,

542
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,965
but you have to realize

543
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,936
that through the manipulation
of the mass media,

544
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,302
the public is under the impression

545
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:29,142
that your cigarettes are linked to...
certain fatal diseases.

546
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,908
Manipulation of the media?

547
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,677
Hell, that's what I pay you for.

548
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,719
Our product is fine.
I smoke 'em myself.

549
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,755
My granddad smoked 'em.
He died at 95 years old.

550
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,188
He was hit by a truck.

551
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,657
I understand. But our hands are tied.

552
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,525
We're no longer allowed to advertise
that Lucky Strikes are safe.

553
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,063
So what the hell are we gonna do?

554
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,690
We've already funded
our own tobacco research center

555
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,632
to put this whole rumor to rest.

556
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,328
And that's a very good start.

557
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,032
But it may not affect sales.

558
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,310
Don, I think maybe that's your cue.

559
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,773
Well, uh...

560
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,941
I have been, uh...

561
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,346
thinking quite a bit about this,

562
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,012
and, uh...

563
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,999
I mean, you know I'm a Lucky Strike man
from way back, so...

564
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,741
I might have a solution.

565
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:41,145
At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering
the burgeoning field of research,

566
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,915
and our analysis shows that the health risks
associated with your product

567
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,547
is not the end of the world.

568
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,253
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

569
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,625
and some of them die.

570
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,063
Cars are dangerous.

571
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,794
There's nothing you can do about it.

572
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,665
You still have to get where you're going.

573
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,370
Cigarettes are exactly the same,

574
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,443
so why don't we simply say,

575
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,841
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

576
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,379
"You're a man.

577
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,675
"The world is dangerous.

578
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,148
"Smoke your cigarette.

579
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,651
You still have to get where you're going. "

580
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,752
That's very interesting.

581
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,793
I mean, if cigarettes were dangerous,

582
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,826
it would be interesting.

583
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,452
Except they aren't.

584
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,224
That's your slogan?

585
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,892
"You're going to die anyway. Die with us"?

586
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,198
Actually, it's a fairly well-established
psychological principle

587
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,569
that society has a death wish,

588
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,074
and if we could just tap into that,

589
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,542
the market potential is...

590
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,203
What the hell are you talking about?

591
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,610
Are you insane?

592
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,012
I'm not selling rifles here.

593
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,981
I'm in the tobacco business.

594
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,518
We're selling America.

595
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,521
The Indians gave it to us, for shit's sake.

596
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,090
Come on, Dad.

597
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,556
Let's get out of here.

598
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,826
The bright spot is at least we know

599
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,728
if we have this problem,
everybody has this problem.

600
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,546
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

601
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,674
I don't know, Don. Can you?

602
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,450
<i>The Federal Trade Commission
and Reader's Digest</i>

603
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,024
have done you a favor.

604
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,854
They've let you know that
any ad that brings up

605
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,828
the concept of cigarettes
and health together...

606
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,900
Well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

607
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,730
Yes, and we're grateful to them.

608
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,433
But what Lee, Jr., said is right.

609
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,703
If you can't make those health claims,
neither can your competitors.

610
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:54,752
So we've got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.

611
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,945
Not exactly.

612
00:30:56,054 --> 00:31:00,753
This is the greatest advertising opportunity
since the invention of cereal.

613
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:06,059
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

614
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,157
We can say anything we want.

615
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,235
How do you make your cigarettes?

616
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,566
I don't know.

617
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,866
Shame on you.

618
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,772
We breed insect-repellent tobacco seeds,

619
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,572
plant them in the North Carolina sunshine,

620
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:24,011
grow it, cut it, cure it, toast it...

621
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,377
There you go.

622
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,643
There you go.

623
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,890
But everybody else's tobacco is toasted.

624
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:41,056
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

625
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,792
Lucky Strikes...

626
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,300
is toasted.

627
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,339
Well, gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.

628
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,967
I think you do.

629
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,970
Advertising is based on one thing:

630
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,913
Happiness.

631
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,213
And you know what happiness is?

632
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,289
Happiness is the smell of a new car.

633
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,750
It's freedom from fear.

634
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,456
It's a billboard on the side of the road
that screams with reassurance

635
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:17,557
that whatever you're doing... it's okay.

636
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,606
You are okay.

637
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,475
It's toasted.

638
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,410
I get it.

639
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,890
You had me worried.

640
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,436
I don't know if you were drunk or not drunk,

641
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,868
but that was inspired.

642
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,600
For the record, I pulled it out of thin air,

643
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,403
so thank you, up there.

644
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,272
You're looking in the wrong direction.

645
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,074
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

646
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,446
what do you say you reconsider this
presidential campaign?

647
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,917
I don't know. Bunting and babies?

648
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,487
That's hard work.

649
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,055
I'd only make hash of it.

650
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,386
Modesty. That's adorable.

651
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,154
Consider the product:
He's young, handsome, Navy hero.

652
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,558
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult

653
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,494
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.

654
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,725
<i>Mr. Draper, you've got visitors.</i>

655
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,497
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

656
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,603
We heard you saved the day.

657
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,336
Oh, thank you, boys. I appreciate it.

658
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,741
I told them how amazing you were.

659
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,438
I'm still tingling.

660
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,141
Well, looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

661
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,410
so I'll be on my way.

662
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,849
Don, thanks again for the home run.

663
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,818
- I love to come through.
- Speaking of which,

664
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,116
any chance you could
patch things up with Rachel Menken?

665
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,283
Any way you can be
as charming as I said you were?

666
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,623
Haven't you had enough
of my magic for one day?

667
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,196
She's worth $3 million.

668
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,787
You're a whore.

669
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,001
Peggy...

670
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,037
Could she get us a little more ice?

671
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,573
<i>- Yes, Mr. Draper?
- Just a minute.</i>

672
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,699
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

673
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,108
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5:15.

674
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,509
The bachelor party's underway.

675
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,740
I don't know.

676
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,078
Oh, come on, Don. All hands on deck.

677
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,845
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

678
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,715
Maybe next time.

679
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,456
Come on, guys.

680
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,082
Don will join us later, right, Don?

681
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,033
If Greta's research was any good,

682
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,262
I would have used it.

683
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,400
What are you talking about?

684
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,566
I'm saying I had a report just like that.

685
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,270
And it's not like there's
some magic machine

686
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,745
that makes identical copies of things.

687
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,142
I still think she was right.

688
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,623
Have a great night, Pete.

689
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,692
Congratulations.

690
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,097
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting.

691
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,800
Fear stimulates my imagination.

692
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,572
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

693
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,343
and for, you know...

694
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,613
standing up for me with Mr. Campbell.

695
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,858
First of all, Peggy,

696
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,369
I'm your boss, not your boyfriend.

697
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,267
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again,

698
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,311
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station.

699
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,978
He said he left his fountain pen in here.

700
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,780
I didn't know.

701
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,288
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

702
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,260
Of course not.

703
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,661
Go home. Put your curlers in.

704
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,756
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow.

705
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,664
Oh. And, Peggy,

706
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,170
I need you to place a call.

707
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,928
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,

708
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,089
whether you have drinks or not.

709
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,257
Uh, every five minutes.

710
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,430
Let's live here.

711
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,970
Better do more than look tonight.

712
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,562
Do you have a girlfriend, Salvatore?

713
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,541
Come on. I'm Italian.

714
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,508
Is there some kind of party here?

715
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,738
How did you swing it?

716
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,782
They work at the Automat.

717
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,614
He pressed a button, and they came out.

718
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,381
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

719
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,887
Definitely not.

720
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,151
Well, I have the best seat.
What are we drinking?

721
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,454
More of whatever's
making you the way you are.

722
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,051
I love this place.

723
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,064
It's hot, loud, and filled with men.

724
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,827
I know what you mean.

725
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,310
Oh, my God. I can already feel it.

726
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,940
I have a feeling you're like this all the time.

727
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,484
I like to laugh.

728
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,917
Is that right?

729
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,080
Now, you stop that.

730
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,555
You said you like to laugh.

731
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,319
I mean it.

732
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,950
It's... It's too...

733
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,756
Too delicious.

734
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,297
Hey, I said stop it.
What do you think you're doing?

735
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,094
You know exactly.

736
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,793
Um, you know what, girls?

737
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,028
I think we should go.

738
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,195
Oh, come on.

739
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,966
You're hurting me.

740
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,367
I'll be good.

741
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,914
Buy the girls whatever they want.

742
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,586
So, uh, what do you fellas do?

743
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,284
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

744
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,293
Hell, the world.

745
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,016
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

746
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,851
and one whiskey neat.

747
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,589
So...

748
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,666
you're going to ply me with drinks

749
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,200
and convince me what a terrible
mistake I'm making.

750
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,893
That is quite a drink.

751
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,031
You got in trouble, didn't you?

752
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,342
I shouldn't have lost my temper,

753
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,414
and I certainly
shouldn't have treated you

754
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,708
like anything less than a client.

755
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,750
Apology accepted.

756
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,454
So you understand.

757
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,352
Now I do.

758
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:23,325
It was, uh, refreshing, really.

759
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,864
I mean, actually hearing all the things
I always assumed people were thinking.

760
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,294
Well, I'm not really as bad as all that.

761
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,667
I was under a lot of pressure.

762
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,071
Another account.

763
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,540
Doesn't really matter.

764
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,705
No, it doesn't.

765
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,547
So, without making things worse,
can I ask you a personal question?

766
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,092
Don't you want to get
a second drink in me first?

767
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,490
Why aren't you married?

768
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,362
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

769
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,626
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman.

770
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,861
Don't you think that getting married
and having a family

771
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,562
would make you happier
than all the headaches

772
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,104
that go along with...

773
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,730
fighting people like me?

774
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,711
If I weren't a woman,
I would be allowed

775
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,407
to ask you the same question.

776
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,881
And if I weren't a woman,

777
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,511
I wouldn't have to choose
between putting on an apron

778
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,614
and the thrill of making my father's store
what I always thought it should be.

779
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:33,823
So that's it. You won't get married
because you find business to be a thrill.

780
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,229
That and...

781
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,431
I've never been in love.

782
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,997
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

783
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,771
I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.

784
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,974
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan.

785
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,344
Oh, you mean love.

786
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,975
You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

787
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,110
where you can't eat and you can't work

788
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:03,490
and you just run off
and get married and make babies.

789
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,530
The reason you haven't felt it
is because it doesn't exist.

790
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,893
What you call love

791
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,992
was invented by guys
like me to sell nylons.

792
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,136
Is that right?

793
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,901
I'm pretty sure about it.

794
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,134
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

795
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,577
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

796
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,909
to make you forget those facts,

797
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,539
but I never forget.

798
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,317
I'm living like there's no tomorrow...

799
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,481
because there isn't one.

800
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,461
I don't think I realized it until this moment,

801
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,490
but it must be hard being a man, too.

802
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:46,964
Excuse me?

803
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:49,738
Mr. Draper...

804
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,171
- Don.
- Mr. Draper,

805
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,608
I don't know what it is
you really believe in,

806
00:41:54,712 --> 00:42:01,709
but I do know what it feels like
to be out of place, to be disconnected,

807
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,515
to see the whole world
laid out in front of you

808
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,988
the way other people live it.

809
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:12,222
There is something about you
that tells me you know it, too.

810
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,729
I don't know if that's true.

811
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,102
You want another drink?

812
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,267
No.

813
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,778
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

814
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,651
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again.

815
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:43,887
I'll be back in the office Monday morning,
for a real meeting.

816
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,962
I'd like that.

817
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,441
We're not buying anything.

818
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,708
Actually, for the first time today,

819
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,943
I'm not selling anything.

820
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,213
Does Peggy live here?

821
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,310
Hold on.

822
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,165
Do you know him?

823
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,963
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

824
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,730
He's really drunk.

825
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,901
It's okay, Marjorie.

826
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:40,509
So... what are you doing?

827
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,676
Nothing.

828
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,050
Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

829
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,089
I'm getting married on Sunday.

830
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,216
I heard that.

831
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,755
You must think I'm a creep.

832
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,359
Why are you here?

833
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,574
I wanted to see you tonight.

834
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,315
Me?

835
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,786
I had to see you.

836
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,730
Marjorie?

837
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,892
Yeah, Peg?

838
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,970
I'm going to bed now.

839
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,624
I called the office. They said you'd left.

840
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,454
I didn't want to bother you.

841
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,328
It's no bother.

842
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,733
I just assumed you were staying
in the city again.

843
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,271
There's a plate in the oven.

844
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,348
Unless you're not hungry.

845
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,747
I'm not.

846
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,781
I'll be right back.

847
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,052
Don't move.
