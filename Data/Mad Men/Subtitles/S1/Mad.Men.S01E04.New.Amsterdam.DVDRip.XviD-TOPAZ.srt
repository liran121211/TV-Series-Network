1
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,639
<i>H- How fast were you going
when Mr. Adams jumped from the car?</i>

2
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,571
<i>75?</i>

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,751
<i>And... And where was that?</i>

4
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,512
<i>L- In your driveway?</i>

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,484
<i>H- How far had Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?</i>

6
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,423
<i>B- Backing out?</i>

7
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,193
It's not Lenny Bruce, but it's good.

8
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,698
This is better. It's funny.

9
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,326
This guy used to be an accountant.
Did you know that?

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,631
Really?

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,137
He's not anymore, is he?

12
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,570
Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell.

13
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,871
Thank you, Hildy.

14
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,139
Lunch date. Good idea.

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,147
You married folks.

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,308
Must be nice to spend
some time together.

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,244
Hello, lovely.

18
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,516
You can do better than that.

19
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,319
Trudy, you know the fellas:

20
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,326
Ken, Paul, and Harry, of course.

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,362
You'll notice only men coming out of there.

22
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,295
I know you all work so hard.

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,297
How's Jennifer?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,958
Good. Swell, actually,

25
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,865
considering she's still
at the phone company.

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,096
Nothing I can do.

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,969
That's not true.
You could give her a baby.

28
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,803
You'll all in on it together.

29
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,469
Nice to see you all again.

30
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,178
Do we have a lunch date?

31
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,579
Because Hildy,
she can show you the book.

32
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,675
No, but I'm taking you away.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,687
Trudy, I don't think
taking you to lunch is part of my job.

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,017
Do you have something today?

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,354
No.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,290
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

37
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,453
I called Hildy
and asked if you were free.

38
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,895
It'll only take a minute, I promise.

39
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,162
I'm sorry. It's great.
Where are we going?

40
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,669
It's a surprise.

41
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,263
Ah, Don, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Trudy Campbell.

42
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,002
Don Draper. Nice to meet you.

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,975
Congratulations.
You're a very lucky girl.

44
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,912
I know. Most of my friends
can't find a good man.

45
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,108
Believe me. I'm the lucky one.

46
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,344
Yes, you are.

47
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,690
He's essential to the process
around here.

48
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,351
I think we're almost
as happy to have him as you are.

49
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,986
Oh, I don't think that's possible.

50
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,031
Well, maybe you're right.

51
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,292
Nice to meet you.

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,637
He's so nice.

53
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,968
Not at all like what I imagined.

54
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,181
1,500 square feet.
Two nice bedrooms.

55
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,018
I don't know if that
includes that maid's room.

56
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,115
Have to be a pretty small maid.

57
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,591
It's on the market for 32,

58
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,221
but Elaine, the realtor,
says we can get it for 30.

59
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:23,769
Lovely, you know that I want
to give you everything.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,395
We don't have to pay
for the whole thing at once.

61
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,598
We can get a mortgage.

62
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,437
Trudy, I make $75 a week.

63
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,374
Now, I know you're not good at math,

64
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,844
but that's $3,500 a year.

65
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,882
You'll make more.

66
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,473
Eventually.

67
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,382
But if we put 10% down,

68
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,113
that's an entire year's salary.

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,918
Sweetheart, we're not in this alone.

70
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
We're a young couple
that needs a little help.

71
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,894
Did you see the sink
in the master bathroom?

72
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,198
It's the same one
they have in The Pierre.

73
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,478
Bill it all to Menken's, Fred.

74
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,743
The girl knows where I
keep the accounts.

75
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,122
Hello.

76
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,384
Mr. Draper.

77
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,858
Didn't expect to see you back here.

78
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,055
Well, we're, uh, screening
a television commercial.

79
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,156
<i>It'll probably look better
when it's breaking up Bonanza.</i>

80
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,868
His work is wonderful.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,801
He's perfect for Menken's.

82
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,566
So he keeps telling me.

83
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,340
Well, I'll let you see Miss Menken out.

84
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,978
How are you?

85
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,611
I'm fine.

86
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,314
My family is fine.

87
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,358
The weather has been spectacular.

88
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,017
Rachel, listen...

89
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,459
What are you doing?

90
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,355
I don't know.

91
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,967
I don't want it to be like this.

92
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,731
Yes, well...

93
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,363
we both know how we'd like it to be.

94
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,034
Can we at least
have lunch sometime?

95
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,341
I really can't see a reason for that.

96
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,053
"Church bells rang out,

97
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,022
"and the air was filled
with flying birds.

98
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,922
"What a joyous parade it was
back at the palace.

99
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:32,020
No king could command
anything finer. "

100
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,359
The end.

101
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,627
The end.

102
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,763
Again?

103
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,840
Daddy will see you in the morning.

104
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,252
Helen, come on. I know you're in there.

105
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,192
Damn it! Helen! Open the door!

106
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,465
Excuse me, Miss.

107
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,093
I know you can hear me. Miss?

108
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,931
Look, can I use your phone?

109
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,408
I'm her husband.

110
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,446
I'm supposed to see my kids,
and I know she's in there.

111
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,105
I just called from the gas station.

112
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,946
No. I'm sorry.

113
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,384
Are you serious?

114
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,581
I'm sure you are who you say you are,

115
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,158
but I don't let strange men
into my home.

116
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,251
Come on.

117
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,075
Can I come in?

118
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,844
Of course.

119
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,192
I'm really sorry.

120
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,489
I'm so embarrassed.

121
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,094
I don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,297
Yes, you do. I was at the window.

123
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,205
Did you let him in?

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,371
Yes.

125
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,645
He's not a bad man.

126
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,280
Do you want some coffee?

127
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,194
It's a joke, really.

128
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,958
Dan hardly saw the kids
at all when we were married.

129
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,499
He works in Manhattan. Life insurance.

130
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,764
Now, all of a sudden,
he can't live without them.

131
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,271
Of course, if he does die, I'm set.

132
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,134
I'm joking.

133
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,471
What happened?

134
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,049
I'll tell you exactly.

135
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,587
He had a lot of friends in the city.

136
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,285
There was poker and tennis,
drinks at the River Club.

137
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,384
Turned out none of them were men.

138
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,591
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

139
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,691
I really just meant
tonight what happened.

140
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,861
Please, I figure I might as well say it.

141
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,962
That's what you've all been
guessing anyway, right?

142
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,904
We haven't all been doing anything.

143
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,710
Okay.

144
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,075
The strangest part of it

145
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,207
is that I think he's angrier
at me than I am at him.

146
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,807
Of course my father got a lawyer,

147
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,387
an army buddy who just
hammered the hell out of him.

148
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,091
I've always loved that house.

149
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,964
Hello.

150
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,073
He has to go right upstairs
and have complete quiet for a while.

151
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,441
He works so hard.

152
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,071
I should get back.

153
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,978
My kids are asleep.

154
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,702
Boat's in the water.

155
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,411
Your cousin Sara had her baby.

156
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,911
Named it after your Uncle Skip.

157
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,139
I think that's nice.

158
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,717
Everything's all ready in the trunks.

159
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,618
We do hope you and Trudy

160
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,123
will be making it out
to the house this summer.

161
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,785
We'll try, but I'm not sure

162
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,193
I'll be able to take
the time off from work.

163
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,994
Work? Ha. I still don't
understand what you do.

164
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,932
I'd hate for you
to miss the blackberries.

165
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,004
Run into you at the club, you're working.

166
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,902
At a restaurant, you're working.

167
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,770
Taking people out to dinner,

168
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,173
wining and whoring.

169
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,836
No job for a white man.

170
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:18,315
She's made such a nice
addition to the table.

171
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,214
So nice and appreciative.

172
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,753
There's a lot more to it than that.

173
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,855
Advertising. Really?

174
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,189
See, if someone were to tell me
there's a lot more to the law,

175
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,489
I'd believe him.

176
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,929
I can't explain
how business works to you.

177
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,403
Trudy found an apartment
that she likes.

178
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,770
Did she? Whereabouts?

179
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,900
83rd and Park. Very nice.

180
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,309
Are you sure you want
to be that far uptown?

181
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,345
It's not that far, Dad.

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,312
It falls off after 79th.

183
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,783
No, darling. They fall off after 86th.

184
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,854
It's a very nice area.

185
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,013
It is.

186
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,920
And, well...

187
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,860
it's actually kind of expensive,

188
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:09,367
so we're going to need help
with the down payment.

189
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,992
Really?

190
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,196
Yes.

191
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,837
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

192
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,004
And why is that?

193
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,572
I just don't think it's a good idea.

194
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,351
You thought it was
a good idea to help Bud

195
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,219
when he hit that girl on her bike
in Montauk last summer.

196
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,552
What did that cost?

197
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,593
I presume it's your profession

198
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,037
that is responsible
for this lapse in your manners.

199
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,472
I'll pay you back.

200
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:54,012
It's not about the money, Peter.

201
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,637
You know that.

202
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,414
Why is it so hard
for you people to give me anything?

203
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,148
We gave you everything.

204
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,816
We gave you your name.

205
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,394
And what have you done with it?

206
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,537
Did you have a nice visit?

207
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,137
They're very keen on us coming out
to Fisher's Island this summer.

208
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,217
Can they help with the apartment?

209
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,076
I didn't bring it up.

210
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,156
My dad's been having
some health problems.

211
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,055
Oh, sweetheart.

212
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,855
What's wrong with him?

213
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,426
Nobody knows.

214
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,242
Walter, how's it going?

215
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,867
Never have much luck,

216
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,412
unless I'm playing
against Campbell here.

217
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,982
Well, he's known for losing gracefully.

218
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,177
You know our art director,
Salvatore Romano.

219
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,982
Did you have a good time
in the city last night?

220
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,181
When I come into town,

221
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,155
I like to do my business and go home.

222
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,521
Unwind with the Psalms.

223
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,187
No man should have to live
out of a suitcase.

224
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,993
So what do you fellows have for me?

225
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,060
Well, we take for granted
the things we need the most:

226
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:30,268
Water, oil, electricity... steel.

227
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,810
I was thinking
about the last time you were here,

228
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,404
looking out this window
at this incredible city

229
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:40,508
and saying... "It's all steel. "

230
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,486
New York City:

231
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,548
Brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

232
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,025
The city of Pittsburgh,

233
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,221
brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

234
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,993
The city of Chicago,
Detroit, St. Louis.

235
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,568
Full-page ads in targeted markets:

236
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,763
Newspapers, trade publications.

237
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,339
Throw in a few billboards

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,000
so your employees can
brag to their girlfriends.

239
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,374
They're kind of plain, aren't they?

240
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,384
Reminds me of those WPA ads
before the war.

241
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,146
Walter, you've been
doing this long enough.

242
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,315
We can throw this artwork
away in a minute.

243
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,253
But the sentiment, the idea,
it's so basic,

244
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,955
you feel like you already know it.

245
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,033
You just haven't thought of it lately.

246
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,263
Cities are made of steel.

247
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,066
Bethlehem Steel.

248
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:38,200
I might be wrong,
but these feel like ads for cities.

249
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,369
You're making our company

250
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,312
look like a middleman
for another product.

251
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,782
Well, would you prefer
an I-beam on a plate

252
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,911
with a pat of butter on it?

253
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,989
No need to get cute, Don.

254
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,557
Just making a point.

255
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,627
Steel is not something
that you can buy at the supermarket.

256
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,959
But it is a commodity.

257
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,156
Walter, I'm surprised.

258
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,292
I believe this is fairly close
to what we had talked about.

259
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,892
We talked about a national strategy

260
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,337
that would involve the virtues
of this essential commodity.

261
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,805
I believe it was more specific.

262
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,400
Don, Walter
has expressed himself.

263
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,945
Now, Walter, if this does not meet
your expectations,

264
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,140
I'm sure Don can find
something that does,

265
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,147
right, Don?

266
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,945
I hate to be a pain in the ass,

267
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,577
but if they didn't
just lay there so flat.

268
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,818
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I'm not from a city.

269
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,327
They just... bother me.

270
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,488
Look, if we can persuade you

271
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,156
to stay in town
another 24 hours...

272
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,961
back at the St. Regis, of course...

273
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,399
it would give us a chance

274
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,993
to come up with something
with more impact.

275
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,766
Get you tickets to a Broadway show.

276
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,637
<i>There's a new one: Uh, Bye Bye Birdie.</i>

277
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,505
I don't like birds, either.

278
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,511
Well, something else, then.

279
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,014
Pete, I think Sal can
show Mr. Veith out. Walt.

280
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,744
Sorry about that.
They are good drawings.

281
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,052
No, the WPA was a very respected style.

282
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,786
20 years ago.

283
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,362
What the hell was that?

284
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,026
Come on, Don.

285
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,299
That's not the first time
someone's been unhappy.

286
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,771
Give it a haircut.

287
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,933
He's a second-time guy anyway.
I could feel that.

288
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,375
And I could feel
he was sentences away.

289
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,071
I'm that kind of guy.

290
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,671
He didn't like the idea.

291
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,977
Someone hadn't prepared him
to like the idea,

292
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,885
an idea he was extremely enthusiastic
about three months ago.

293
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,857
I'm sorry I didn't lower
his expectations enough.

294
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,722
You do your job.

295
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,955
Take him sailing.
Get him in a bathing suit.

296
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,462
Leave the ideas to me.

297
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,726
I have ideas.

298
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,665
I'm sure you do.

299
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,261
Sterling Cooper has more failed artists
and intellectuals than the Third Reich.

300
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,501
You know what? I have good ideas.

301
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,703
In fact, I used to carry around
a notebook and pen just to keep track.

302
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,144
Direct marketing. I thought of that.

303
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,706
Turned out it already existed,
but I arrived at it independently.

304
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,410
And then I come to this place,

305
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,579
and you people tell me
I'm good with people,

306
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,781
which is strange

307
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,290
because I'd never heard that before.

308
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,070
Draper residence.

309
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,573
<i>Betty? Helen Bishop. Are you busy?</i>

310
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,577
Well... no, I'm just finishing up dinner.

311
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,143
Of course.

312
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,811
Listen, this may be truly rude,
but I was wondering.

313
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,219
I'm supposed to be stuffing envelopes
at Kennedy Headquarters tonight,

314
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,848
and my sitter just cancelled,

315
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,393
and I hate to back out
because, well, you know,

316
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,759
New York State is so important.

317
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,162
I didn't know that.

318
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,359
Well, anyway, I was wondering

319
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,834
if you could come watch
the kids for a few hours.

320
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,495
Right now?

321
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,103
You know what?
I shouldn't have asked.

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,172
Well, let me just get dinner on the table.

323
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,310
I guess Don can watch the kids.

324
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,253
Really? Gosh, that would be wonderful.

325
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,347
Take your time.

326
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,225
<i>Put that lemonade into the floor show.</i>

327
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,160
<i>That's a swell ideal</i>

328
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,061
<i>But how could we do that?</i>

329
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,932
Oh, you're a lifesaver, truly.

330
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,666
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

331
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,002
Hiroshima, I know.

332
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,339
Cleaning lady and babysitter are one.

333
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,877
Oh, stop.

334
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,708
It's charming.

335
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,977
That's beautiful, Glen.

336
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,416
Except he can wake the baby.

337
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,509
Glen, stop that now.

338
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,815
You remember Mrs. Draper?

339
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,356
She's going to take
care of you while I'm gone.

340
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,857
No ironing.

341
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,860
Ironing?

342
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,487
I give him 5 cents a piece.
He loves doing it,

343
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,929
Oh, there you are.

344
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,524
I swear to God, I am so exhausted
when I get home from the jewelry store

345
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,605
that I just kick these off,
and I never know where they end up.

346
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,901
<i>You, Glen Bishop, in bed
after The Real McCoys.</i>

347
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,407
No discussions.

348
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,314
You look very nice.

349
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,179
They keep the place poorly lit.

350
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,385
I guess there'll be a lot of nice men there.

351
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,051
Yes. I guess so,
although it's mostly women.

352
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,856
Have you seen the candidate?

353
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,658
On the news. He's handsome.

354
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,029
But I'm not sure who we're voting for.

355
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,602
Well, I'll bring you back
some literature.

356
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,261
I'll be back before 10, I promise.

357
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,339
Glen.

358
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,051
You got to get
that Lux soap campaign

359
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,492
over to Sterling Cooper.

360
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,689
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood...

361
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,356
now, there's a day at the office.

362
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,024
Is that an orange?

363
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,502
I'm telling you, you boys,
you've got it made.

364
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,731
Martini lunches,

365
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,898
gorgeous women parading through.

366
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,602
In my next life,
I'm coming back as an ad man.

367
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,043
Well, there's slightly more to it than that.

368
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,774
Yeah? Well, I'd keep that to yourself.

369
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,179
I met his boss yesterday.

370
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,046
You should have heard
the nice things he said.

371
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,676
He's not my boss.

372
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,584
Well, isn't that nice?

373
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,714
To be appreciated for what you do?

374
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,627
We have some great news.

375
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,457
Already?

376
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,589
Honestly, you two. It's not that.

377
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,497
We found an apartment.

378
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,662
Oh. Well, that's exciting, too.

379
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,863
Yes, well, unfortunately,

380
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,203
it's a bit out of our
price range right now.

381
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,605
I've been looking in the neighborhood,

382
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,371
and it seems very well priced to me:

383
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,810
32, but the realtor says
we can get it for 30.

384
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,313
- Around here?
- 83rd, but...

385
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,508
- How many rooms?
- Five:

386
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,915
Two bedrooms, two baths, a terrace.

387
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,914
I don't know.

388
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,513
I'd have to look at it first.

389
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,561
Oh, thank you.

390
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,462
Sir...

391
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,626
I'll take Tom or Dad, you got me?

392
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:16,364
Tom, it's very generous
for you to even consider it,

393
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,308
but I think we'd rather wait.

394
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,139
For what?

395
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,475
Start your life already.

396
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,140
You're gonna be a rich bastard
on your own someday,

397
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,717
and waiting's a bunch of bullshit.

398
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,376
- Tomcat.
- It is.

399
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,784
Your confidence is really...

400
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,719
well, it's swell.

401
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,758
But honestly,
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

402
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,952
I am.

403
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:40,259
Pete, this is an investment
for me, in you.

404
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,764
And my jellybean over here, of course.

405
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,772
Oh, thank you. You're gonna love it.

406
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,575
We'll be so happy there.

407
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,488
I knew they'd help us.

408
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,428
I know you did.

409
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,467
Oh, come on.

410
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,968
You can't possibly be angry with me.

411
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,372
I'm just not sure taking that kind
of money is a good idea.

412
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,171
He's not paying for the whole thing.

413
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,677
It's still a lot of money,

414
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,371
and I'm not sure what it means.

415
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,542
It means
we get the apartment.

416
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,587
Do they get to tell us
where to put the furniture?

417
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,020
They're not like that.

418
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,354
You would have taken
money from your parents.

419
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,358
That's different.

420
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,359
Why?

421
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,327
Because that's my money.

422
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,522
I'll get it eventually.

423
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,758
So this is my money.

424
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,098
Sweetheart, he wants to help.

425
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,637
It makes him feel good.

426
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,967
Well, what about me?

427
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,631
Well, what about me?

428
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,607
You always get
what you want, don't you?

429
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,116
I got you. That's all I really wanted.

430
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,921
Excuse me.
Can we turn up Park?

431
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,888
I need to meet a client downtown.

432
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,961
Hush. It'll only take a sec.

433
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,030
The Armory.

434
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,191
When are they gonna
tear that dinosaur down?

435
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,983
I'll be right back.

436
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,585
I'm in here.

437
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,515
Glen, I said get out.

438
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,619
Young man, what is wrong with you?

439
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,754
This room is occupied.

440
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,106
What do you have to say for yourself?

441
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,515
Glen, look at me.

442
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,712
That was very bad.

443
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,817
You know better than to walk in
on someone like that.

444
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,091
That room is private, extremely private.

445
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,063
Well, that's all I'm trying to say.

446
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,965
Now look at me.

447
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,902
Don't you think
you owe me an apology?

448
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,706
Well?

449
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,839
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,818
Well, good.

451
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,151
That's not the way to behave, okay?

452
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,227
Now...

453
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,392
It's all right. I'm not angry anymore.

454
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,608
You're pretty.

455
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,646
Well, thank you, dear.

456
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,277
Really pretty.

457
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:34,256
That's sweet of you to say.

458
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,089
How old are you?

459
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:41,996
Well, I'm the same age
as your mother.

460
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,590
How old is your mother?

461
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,964
She's 32.

462
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,038
I'm 28.

463
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,873
Your hair is so beautiful.
You look like a princess.

464
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,573
Well, I don't know about that.

465
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,978
Can I have some?

466
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,311
What?

467
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,978
Can I have some of your hair?

468
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,124
Glen, no.

469
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,249
Just a little piece?

470
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,622
Glen.

471
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,525
You won't even miss it.

472
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,387
Now off to bed with you.

473
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,657
And no radio.

474
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,973
Evening, gentlemen.

475
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,813
Walter, I'd like you to meet my cousins

476
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,851
Charlotte and Wendy.

477
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,786
Ladies, it's a pleasure.

478
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,415
We were hoping
you were Pete's friends.

479
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,187
You must be the man of steel.

480
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,886
Will you look at that?

481
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,159
You could lose a nickel
in those dimples.

482
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,963
I thought your cousin
Wendy was a redhead.

483
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,164
No, that's my cousin Doris.

484
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,241
She wasn't available this evening.

485
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,504
Well, I think we can make do
with this branch of the family.

486
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,606
I'm glad you decided to stay over.

487
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,978
So am I.

488
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,612
Hey, bottle of champagne for the table
and another round of these, plus one.

489
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,265
You know, I had some thoughts
about your campaign today.

490
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,730
Did you?

491
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,794
Well, I was trying to express
the essentialness of steel,

492
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,773
and I thought, Bethlehem Steel:

493
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,242
The backbone of America.

494
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,937
What do you think?

495
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,279
Unbelievable. Did Draper tell you
to try and sneak this one by me?

496
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,442
No. I was just...

497
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,247
Campbell, get off the clock.

498
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,881
We have two lovely ladies here.

499
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:24,826
The only backbone
I'm interested in now is right here.

500
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,564
So, tell me, Wendy, what do you do

501
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,398
when you're not
lighting up rooms with your smile?

502
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,497
Well, I'm an actress,
and I take some classes at Hunter.

503
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,041
Do you?

504
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:42,102
I would have thought you slept all day
and bathed in milk.

505
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,395
How was it?

506
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,863
It was nice. Very quiet.

507
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,332
Oh. In case you're interested.

508
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,336
Oh. Thank you.

509
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,702
I'll be sure to look at it.

510
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,866
I can't thank you enough.

511
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,966
I hope I can return the favor sometime.

512
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,274
Oh, please, don't even think about it.

513
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,223
Looks pretty familiar.

514
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,955
Well, I wanted to maintain
our original strategy,

515
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,623
but I think the wordplay achieves
what you're looking for:

516
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,393
The idea that from the acorn...

517
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,297
that is, Bethlehem Steel...

518
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,370
comes America's great cities.

519
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,065
I know this isn't the idea
you want to sell me,

520
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,801
so don't sell it so damn well.

521
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,043
Excuse me?

522
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,170
The backbone idea.

523
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,613
Campbell pitched it to me last night.

524
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,945
I like it.

525
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,884
What backbone idea?

526
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,855
Bethlehem Steel:
The backbone of America.

527
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,720
Wasn't that it?

528
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,528
Oh, right.

529
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,121
It's concise, strong,

530
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,565
and frankly, I like that you were
so enthusiastic about it

531
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,637
you couldn't wait to tell me.

532
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,207
Thanks again, boys.

533
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,642
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.

534
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,805
Hope your visit to New York was productive.

535
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,883
I'm warming to the place.

536
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,449
Nice work.

537
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,685
I told you I had ideas.

538
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,625
Yes, you did.

539
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,857
Good one. Enjoy it.

540
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,527
You know what I think?

541
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:22,402
I think I did something good,
and you got the compliment for it.

542
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,538
Listen, Pete,

543
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:31,741
I need you to go
get a cardboard box...

544
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,010
and put your things in it.

545
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,346
Okay?

546
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,862
You picked the wrong time
to buy an apartment.

547
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,713
<i>H- How far has Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?</i>

548
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,716
<i>B- Backing out?</i>

549
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,383
Everybody out.

550
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,455
Now!

551
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,325
<i>Uh, did he cover starting the car?</i>

552
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,719
<i>And the other way to stop.</i>

553
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,167
Remember Pete Campbell's last day?

554
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,338
It's today.

555
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,846
What happened?

556
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,146
While I was breaking my neck
trying to fix the hash he made yesterday,

557
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,083
he was at the St. Regis pitching copy.

558
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,584
His copy.

559
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:49,019
That little shit.

560
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,650
It was hard to see her all alone like that...

561
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,061
supporting herself
with that sad little job at the jewelry store.

562
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,227
Frozen food.

563
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,902
I mean, I know
she gets some kind of help,

564
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,637
but still, she looks so exhausted.

565
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,305
She tries to put on a brave face.

566
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,427
Honestly, I think she's jealous of me.

567
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,463
I've seen it before. I was in a sorority.

568
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,664
I mean, seeing happy families all around.

569
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,708
But I don't know what I can do.

570
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,440
I can't just disappear. I live there.

571
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,718
Of course, my real concern
is those children.

572
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,615
I mean, the baby
won't know the difference,

573
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,693
but that poor little boy.

574
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,792
The person taking care of him
isn't giving him what he needs.

575
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,405
You know?

576
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,825
Gentlemen, please.

577
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,369
You really love that thing.

578
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,338
You were cute back then.

579
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,413
Pete Campbell.

580
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,743
On his way out.

581
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,613
Sorry to hear that.

582
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,686
Can't be avoided, I'm afraid.

583
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,482
I wish I could agree with that.

584
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,587
He's a junior account executive

585
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:39,288
who brought his own idea
to a client in a bar.

586
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,523
There are rules.

587
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,225
There are other rules.

588
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,864
What's the problem?

589
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:52,064
New York City is a marvelous machine

590
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,545
filled with a mesh of levers
and gears and springs,

591
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:00,674
like a fine watch wound tight.

592
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,548
Always ticking.

593
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,314
Sounds more like a bomb.

594
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,152
How much do you know
about Pete's family?

595
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,624
Nothing, except they put out
a mediocre product.

596
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,890
His mother is
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell.

597
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,227
The Dykemans
owned pretty much everything

598
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,062
north of 125th Street,

599
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,466
which I don't know
how good your geography is,

600
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,868
but that's a fair chunk of the island.

601
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,373
So they're rich. So what?

602
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,703
Well, no.

603
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,870
Uh, his grandfather dropped it all in '29.

604
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,379
Panicked.

605
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,247
Some people have no confidence
in this country.

606
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,654
What's your concern, then?

607
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,247
Well, I don't want
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell

608
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,021
standing on the dock
at Fisher's Island this summer

609
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,689
talking about how badly
Sterling Cooper treated her son.

610
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,198
I don't think any of us want that.

611
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,666
We lose him,

612
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,296
we lose our entree to Buckley, DKE,

613
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,967
the Maidstone Club, the Century Club,

614
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,805
Dartmouth...

615
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,108
Gracie Mansion sometimes.

616
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,740
It's a marquee issue for us.

617
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,911
See my point?

618
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,921
Absolutely.

619
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,821
He's more valuable to the agency than I am.

620
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,085
Don't fool yourself.

621
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,026
There's a Pete Campbell
at every agency out there.

622
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,189
Well, let's get one of the other ones.

623
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,926
You're going to need a stronger stomach

624
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:27,027
if you're going to be back in the kitchen
seeing how the sausage is made.

625
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,240
Thought it was a big watch.

626
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,836
You handle the words.

627
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:40,815
You know how much
we want you here with us.

628
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,045
No doubt about that.

629
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,452
Don's a big boy, Bert.

630
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,751
Aren't you, Don?

631
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,431
Well, thank you, sir.

632
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,361
There you go.

633
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,268
I'm glad we're all better now.

634
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,898
What you did
is totally unacceptable.

635
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,061
I realize that.

636
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,230
I want you to be very clear about this.

637
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,898
You were fired. I wanted you out.

638
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,373
Cooper wanted you out.

639
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,105
And you would be if it weren't for this man.

640
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,944
He thought you deserved another chance.

641
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,577
That's right. He fought for you.

642
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,949
I don't know what to say.

643
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,317
Say nothing.

644
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,358
You're here because
of Don Draper's largesse.

645
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,757
Thank you. Thank you so much.

646
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,626
Now, I know that your generation
went to college instead of serving,

647
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,823
so I'll illuminate you:

648
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,297
This man is your commanding officer.

649
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,700
You live and die in his shadow.

650
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,396
Understood?

651
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,073
I won't let you down, Don.

652
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,770
Jesus, Campbell.

653
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,847
Don't ever say that.

654
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,460
I bet daily friendship with that bottle
attracts more people to advertising

655
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,557
than any salary you can dream of.

656
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,329
It's why I got in.

657
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,098
So enjoy it.

658
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,567
I'm doing my best here.

659
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:44,732
Oh, you're not.

660
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,367
You don't know how to drink,
your whole generation.

661
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,809
You drink for the wrong reasons.

662
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:53,077
My generation,
we drink because it's good.

663
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,778
Because it feels better
than unbuttoning your collar.

664
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,354
Because we deserve it.

665
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,890
We drink because it's what men do.

666
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,219
What about shaky hands?

667
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,920
I see a lot of that, too, with you boys.

668
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,430
No joke. Your kind with your gloomy
thoughts and your worries,

669
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,433
you're all busy licking
some imaginary wound.

670
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,765
Not all imaginary.

671
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,498
Yeah, boo-hoo.

672
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,803
Maybe I'm not as comfortable
being powerless as you are.

673
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:24,941
Pardon?

674
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,918
You know, you shouldn't
compete with Pete Campbell.

675
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:31,919
I'm not.

676
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,387
Yeah. You are.

677
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,257
Not at a personal level,
but for the world.

678
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,893
I don't know.

679
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,369
Maybe every generation thinks
the next one is the end of it all.

680
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,912
I bet there are people in the Bible

681
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,576
walking around complaining
about kids today.

682
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,423
Kids today, they have
no one to look up to...

683
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,188
because they're looking up to us.

684
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,259
Of course, if you're not
going to have live-in help,

685
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,895
that back room can be used
for any number of things.

686
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,066
I don't think we'll be having live-in help
just yet, do you, sweetheart?

687
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,700
No, I think we'll be
managing on our own for now.

688
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,107
Oh, I'm so glad you could come.

689
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,912
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Clifford Lyman.

690
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,486
She'll be one
of your new neighbors,

691
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,418
and she's on the co-op board.

692
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,683
Of course you know these two.

693
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,156
Where's the nursery at?

694
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,283
Thank you, Tom.

695
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,952
I don't want to hear that again.

696
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:45,994
Mrs. Lyman, Trudy Campbell.

697
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,620
So nice to meet you.

698
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,755
Well, aren't you darling?

699
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,163
The two of you.

700
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,894
A pleasure.

701
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,334
Now, I know I shouldn't ask, but I have to.

702
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,201
Your mother-in-law was just telling me

703
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:59,367
that your great-great-grandfather
was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt?

704
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,670
Is that right?

705
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,803
Um, yes. That's true.

706
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,349
That was Nicholas Dykeman, right?

707
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,418
On his mother's side.

708
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,317
Can you imagine orchards
on 204th Street?

709
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,822
He's buried at the Church
of the Intercession.

710
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,688
Oh, my goodness.
Wait until I tell my husband

711
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,762
there's going to be a Dykeman
living in the building.

712
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,727
He'll be so thrilled.

713
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,631
Sweetheart, tell Mrs. Lyman
the story about your great-great aunt

714
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,896
getting in that fight
with the British soldier and the Hessian.

715
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,596
You tell it, dear.

716
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,936
You tell it so much better than I do.

717
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,067
Well, I think it was
his great-great aunt,

718
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,476
or great-great-great... I'm not sure...

719
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,673
but it was before
the Revolutionary War,

720
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,273
and the Dykemans owned
a large tract of land

721
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,875
just north of Central Park.

722
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,820
Of course, it wasn't called Central Park
back then, but...
