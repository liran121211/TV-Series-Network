1
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,375
Hold the doors, please!

2
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,883
Thank you. Good morning.

3
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,577
Good morning.

4
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,347
Draper has you in early, huh?

5
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,423
- What's he up to?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,220
I kind of came in for myself.

7
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,588
Okay.

8
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,059
Honestly, I couldn't sleep.

9
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,063
I'm just filled with nerves.

10
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,860
The service elevator is out.

11
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,160
Do you mind?

12
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,465
I'm moving today.

13
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,604
I'm supposed to go by at lunch
and supervise the movers.

14
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,683
Probably lose the rest of the day
watching other people work.

15
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,252
Well, that is a big day.

16
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,184
What do you have
to be nervous about?

17
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,517
Nothing.

18
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:34,354
Just I think Mr. Rumsen is presenting
my copy today to the Belle Jolie people.

19
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,395
A thing like that.

20
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,561
We really took the local, didn't we?

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,433
It's 7 in the morning.

22
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,733
I'm very sorry, sir.

23
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,308
Here we are.

24
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,588
I'm going to hop down for a coffee.

25
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,750
- Would you like some?
- No.

26
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,327
Are you sure?

27
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,056
Come in here, please.

28
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,966
Close the door.

29
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,440
There's no one here.

30
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,011
Close the door.

31
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,795
Peggy... do you know how hard it is

32
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,660
to see you walking
around here every day?

33
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,903
Your skirt. It's tight.

34
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,440
Just pull it up.

35
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,612
Be careful.

36
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,269
Listen,

37
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,240
maybe this isn't
the right time to mention this,

38
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,778
but I want to clear the air.

39
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,973
I know I told you I would read
the copy that you wrote,

40
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,143
but... I haven't.

41
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,314
I'm glad.

42
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,947
I thought you just didn't like it.

43
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,522
That's too bad.

44
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,827
Peggy.

45
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,366
I know what you're going to say.

46
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,336
No.

47
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,100
You don't.

48
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,369
You haven't been right once.

49
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,981
I have all these things going on
in my head, and I can't say them.

50
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,818
Do you think about me?

51
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,358
I'll be honest.

52
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,527
A few times.

53
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,229
You're only 20 yards away.

54
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,067
Not right now.

55
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,112
I wake up in the morning
and I look into Trudy's eyes,

56
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,582
and I think, "We're supposed
to be one person. "

57
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,548
But whatever I try...

58
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,387
I have all these things
going on in my head.

59
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,597
She's just another stranger.

60
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,905
Pete.

61
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,538
You're not alone in this.

62
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,186
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.

63
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,783
It's okay.

64
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,941
Morning. Sterling Cooper. Please hold.

65
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,943
Look who's off the clock again.

66
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,285
He's speaking Italian to his mother.

67
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,987
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

68
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,564
My stars.

69
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,327
Two weeks in, and she's already a goner.

70
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,403
He talks to his mother a lot.

71
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,937
Mr. Crane? I'll connect you.

72
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,131
Because he's not married.

73
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,503
Well, he's in the Art Department?

74
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,974
What does he look like?

75
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,238
<i>Did you see that movie Marty
with Ernest Borgnine?</i>

76
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,608
He lived with his mother.

77
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,079
Stop teasing her.

78
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,581
Yes, right away.

79
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,275
My guess is tall, dark, and handsome,

80
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,853
but I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

81
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,249
She is so thoughtful.

82
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,915
- Let me get my purse.
- Forget it.

83
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,051
Mrs. Sterling will be calling
before lunchtime today.

84
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,459
Please put her through directly to me.

85
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,724
- Done.
- Ask her. She'll know.

86
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,497
Salvatore Romano in the Art Department.

87
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,660
Do you know him?

88
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,171
Handsome. Very debonair.

89
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,208
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.

90
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,867
Something European, maybe.

91
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,410
You're so specific.

92
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,675
You have voices. I have other things.

93
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,841
Thank you so much for holding.

94
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,313
Good morning.

95
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,683
Good morning.

96
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,257
Mr. Cooper wanted
to see you in his office.

97
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,882
Tell Mr. Sterling I'll be right there.

98
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,620
No, it's just Mr. Cooper.

99
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,092
Thank you, Peggy.

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,462
What happened there?

101
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,433
I caught it on something.

102
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,504
I might start keeping a spare.

103
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,451
Come on in.

104
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,688
I'd prefer you didn't
smoke in here right now.

105
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,701
Don, I am appreciative of your talents,

106
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,703
and although that cannot be measured,

107
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,764
I have made an effort to quantify.

108
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,313
$2,500.

109
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,615
L...

110
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,351
Thank you. That's what you say.

111
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,155
Have you read her?

112
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,494
Rand.

113
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,501
<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>

114
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,730
That's the one.

115
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,069
Yes. Yes, it is.

116
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,143
See, I know you haven't read it.

117
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,370
When you hit 40,

118
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:12,475
you realize you've met or seen
every kind of person there is,

119
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,145
and I know what kind you are.

120
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,916
Because I believe we are alike.

121
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,427
I assume that's flattering.

122
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,295
By that I mean you are a productive
and reasonable man,

123
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,393
and in the end completely self-interested.

124
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,233
It's strength.

125
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,170
We are different...

126
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,674
unsentimental about all the people

127
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,474
who depend on our hard work.

128
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:49,352
Take $1.99 out of that $2,500
and buy yourself a copy.

129
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,956
I will.

130
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,034
Well, hello, there.

131
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,970
Hello.

132
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,600
Are you Traffic, or are you here for casting?

133
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,235
I'm... I'm not a model.

134
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,313
I'm new.

135
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,471
Excuse me, Marty,

136
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,947
who's doing the Firestone comps,
you or Frank?

137
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,518
Neither of us. Sal.
We were talking to Miss...

138
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,850
Lois. Lois Sadler.

139
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,014
I'm new here. Switchboard.

140
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,489
Marty Faraday.

141
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,820
Why would they hide you?

142
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,624
Hi, Lois. Duane Davis.

143
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,665
Salvatore Romano.

144
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,358
Sorry about the mess.

145
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,662
Oh, no, it's divine.

146
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,236
I work in a closet all day,

147
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,498
so just to come out
and walk around is wonderful.

148
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,904
Is there anything I can do for you?

149
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,806
I'm such a featherhead.

150
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,743
I need to get my paperwork
in to Accounting,

151
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,712
then find my way back
to the switchboard room.

152
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,282
Am I close?

153
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,581
No. You're not even on the right floor.

154
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,847
I'll walk you there.

155
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,445
No. Just point me there. I'm fine.

156
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,887
Go upstairs,

157
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,458
make a left outside of the stairwell,

158
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,754
follow the wall past the ladies' room.

159
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,394
Well, nice to meet you.

160
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,832
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

161
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,942
That ate up some time.

162
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,671
I like when they flirt with me.

163
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,644
She was flirting with him.

164
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,342
You know, I had the salesman
pushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.

165
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,682
I'd have bought it right away
if I knew it worked.

166
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,256
It's not the ties.
They always talk to you.

167
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,086
They can tell you make money.

168
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:38,061
I told you, you don't need money
to dress better than you do, Duane.

169
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,529
<i>Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.</i>

170
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,199
What line?

171
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,605
Light up a line, will you?

172
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,178
<i>No, she's right here, in person.</i>

173
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,579
Send her in.

174
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,818
Hello, my love.

175
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,821
Hello, homeowner.

176
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,083
What are you doing here, lovely?

177
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,091
I thought I'd come get you
and we could go together.

178
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,353
We could even walk.

179
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,689
It's 30 blocks.

180
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,592
It's beautiful outside.

181
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,268
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.

182
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, then let's do this here.

183
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,346
I said I'd meet you there
if my schedule allowed,

184
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,076
and now it doesn't look so good.

185
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,516
No, you didn't, and I'm here now.

186
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,518
What does it matter?

187
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,350
This is my office.

188
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,351
How do you think it looks?

189
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,987
Like you are beloved by your wife.

190
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,293
You see what happens
when you just show up like this?

191
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,995
We fight.

192
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,300
I came here to celebrate
us having our apartment,

193
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,274
which I for one am happy about.

194
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,969
And you have ruined it.

195
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,377
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,042
I'm just busier than I thought.

197
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,450
Let's have a glass of champagne.

198
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,885
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,393
We're going to live there a long time.

200
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,430
There's no point in being superstitious.

201
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,769
<i>It's as simple as E pluribus unum:</i>

202
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,564
"From many, one. "

203
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,801
From many shades of lipstick,
one that belongs to her.

204
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,477
From a basket of kisses,
she picks one.

205
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,810
It makes her unique. It colors her kiss.

206
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,545
And her kiss, well, it colors her man.

207
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,147
"Belle Jolie Lipstick. Mark Your Man. "

208
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,657
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.

209
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,459
Women want colors,
lots and lots of colors.

210
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,192
"Mark Your Man. "

211
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,528
It's pretty cute.

212
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,431
Oh, you like this?

213
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,302
Well, maybe we should cut
down to five shades or one.

214
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,899
I'm not telling you to listen to anyone,
but this is a very fresh approach.

215
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,204
It's okay, Kenny.

216
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,305
I don't think there's much else
to do here but call it a day.

217
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,008
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

218
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,176
Is that all?

219
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,449
You're a nonbeliever.

220
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,717
Why should we waste time on Kabuki?

221
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,293
I don't know what that means.

222
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,225
It means that you've
already tried your plan,

223
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,389
and you're number 4.

224
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,261
You've enlisted my expertise,

225
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,801
and you've rejected it to go on
the way you've been going.

226
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,770
I'm not interested in that.
You can understand.

227
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,104
I don't think your three months
or however many thousands of dollars

228
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,508
entitles you to refocus
the core of our business.

229
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,843
Listen, I'm not here to tell you about Jesus.

230
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,176
You already know about Jesus.

231
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,218
Either He lives in your heart
or He doesn't.

232
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,119
Every woman wants choices,

233
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,387
but in the end, none wants to be one
of a hundred in a box.

234
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,052
She's unique.

235
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,598
She makes the choices,
and she's chosen him.

236
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,759
She wants to tell the world, "He's mine.

237
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,666
He belongs to me, not you. "

238
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,298
She marks her man with her lips.

239
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,932
He is her possession.

240
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,910
You've given every girl
that wears your lipstick

241
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,743
the gift of total ownership.

242
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,249
Sit down.

243
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,824
No.

244
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,326
Not until I know I'm not wasting my time.

245
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,862
Sit down.

246
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,460
Do you know how to get
back to the Roosevelt?

247
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,504
We could have someone walk you over,
or just meet you, if you're interested.

248
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,335
You're a troublemaker.

249
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,602
Although, it is a place to get into trouble.

250
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,405
They just did this incredible renovation.

251
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,174
It reminds me a little of a steamship.

252
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,441
And the people...

253
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,948
I was in the lounge last night,

254
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,451
and I end up having a drink
with Robert Mitchum.

255
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,179
Actually, many drinks.

256
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,280
Now, you know we wouldn't
steer you wrong.

257
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,319
Nice work.
I think you may be right about this.

258
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,192
Well, we'll never know, will we?

259
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,662
What?

260
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,027
It's not a science, Hugh.

261
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,498
We'll do our best.

262
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,263
That Jesus thing.

263
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,535
I don't know what to say.

264
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,635
Probably better than dangling him
out the window by his ankles.

265
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,304
That's just a story.

266
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,938
Don's never actually done that.

267
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,880
Ken, you will realize in your private life

268
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,819
that at a certain point seduction is over
and force is actually being requested.

269
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,014
Ah, he's a kid.

270
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,920
He thinks it's the other way around.

271
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,137
<i>Peggy, icel We'll need some.</i>

272
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,143
Should I just put it down?

273
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,212
How much ice?

274
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,877
How do you take it?

275
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,521
Home run, ballerina.

276
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,582
Go ahead, before
Joan Holloway sees.

277
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,265
You call that celebrating?

278
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,773
The meeting was so long, I was worried.

279
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,934
We barely finished the presentation,
and he bought it.

280
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,069
No, he's being modest.

281
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,976
Donald walked around
the village three times

282
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,673
and then set it on fire.

283
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,513
Oh, my God. Can I see it?

284
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,217
It's marvelous.

285
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,484
I thought it was going to say

286
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,389
"It's the mark
you make on your man. "

287
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,291
Was it, now?

288
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,159
You may be a writer, honey.

289
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,425
Really?

290
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,262
You're arrogant.

291
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,268
You want another drink?

292
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,565
I don't know.

293
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,934
- Not a writer.
- Not a writer.

294
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,535
Can I keep it?

295
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,805
No.

296
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,484
What are you doing?

297
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,249
Don't ever put your name on a list.

298
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,290
They keep track of everything we do here.

299
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,326
Have you never heard
of Joseph McCarthy?

300
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,088
It's the bowling team.

301
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,925
Oh, my God. It happened.

302
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,498
- They loved it.
- What are you talking about?

303
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,066
I'm heading out. Don't look for me.

304
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,828
I have errands to run.

305
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,801
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.

306
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,836
Congratulations!

307
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,928
That's so fascinating!

308
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,372
I'm glad your other work
was suffering for a reason.

309
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,807
They poured me a drink.

310
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,502
- Who?
- Mr. Draper.

311
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,807
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and...

312
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh, I'm so jealous.

313
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,208
Don't be. I was just...
I shouldn't be bragging.

314
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,717
They sold Peggy's copy.

315
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,877
My word.

316
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,181
Actually, they changed it a little bit,

317
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,220
but it worked.

318
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,052
- Oh, we're celebrating.
- How about it?

319
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,649
Five minutes to 5,
we head to P.J. Clarke's.

320
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Perfect!

321
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,036
It's going to be a hell of an afternoon
traffic meeting.

322
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,472
Oh, champagne.

323
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,872
When did that happen?

324
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,104
Another grateful client stopped by.

325
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,179
I thought you were moving today.

326
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,680
I was looking forward to seeing you
in a pair of coveralls.

327
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,012
Yes, well, I managed to explain
to the concerned party

328
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,813
that I already have a job.

329
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,115
Do they ever stop asking for things?

330
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,693
Hello.

331
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,955
Hello.

332
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,759
Hildy, um, she must have
gone to lunch already.

333
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,265
Congratulations.

334
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,859
Yes. I hear you're quite the little scribe.

335
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,096
You can trust Ken's opinion here.

336
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,365
He's a published author, you know.

337
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,838
But he can't write copy.

338
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,432
I don't like to limit my words that much.

339
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,239
I also hate puns.

340
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,403
Come on.

341
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,710
"Admiral: The television
that won't go down the tubes. "

342
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,918
Shut up.

343
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,984
So you going to celebrate?

344
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,112
Well, yes, actually.

345
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,886
A bunch of us... just the girls so far...
are going to P. J. Clarke's tonight.

346
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,223
Forget tonight. I heard Cooper, Sterling,
and Draper already left.

347
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,227
Am I wrong?

348
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,059
What about Mr. Rumsen?

349
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,156
Freddie Rumsen's at P.J.'s right now,

350
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,461
and he doesn't know there's a party.

351
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,129
3:00, after the traffic meeting.

352
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,364
Joan's a tattletale.

353
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,072
I don't know, Peggy.

354
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,110
I'm kind of senior ranking
when those other men are gone.

355
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,045
Speaker of the House.
He'll be there.

356
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,380
I should probably go home, actually.

357
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,546
Well, if we're starting at 3,
you can go home at 5.

358
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,419
It'll still be after work.

359
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,617
We all work so hard,

360
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,023
I think we all need it.

361
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,089
Why not?

362
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,626
Toodle-oo.

363
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,806
Hello.

364
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,511
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch,

365
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,417
but I have a phone call for you.

366
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,648
Well, I'm glad I stayed in.

367
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,988
Oh, it's disconnected.

368
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,229
<i>Everybody's talking about the meeting.</i>

369
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,598
Miss Olsen said your artwork
was spectacular.

370
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,193
She did, did she?

371
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,499
<i>Anyway, a bunch of us</i>

372
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,903
are taking her out to drinks.

373
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,066
P.J. Clarke's?

374
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,166
<i>She deserves it.</i>

375
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,405
You have to come.

376
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,777
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.

377
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,509
I know that.

378
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,518
<i>I'll be there.</i>

379
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,417
Good.

380
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,357
Can I help you?

381
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,737
Can I help you, sir?

382
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,708
It's Don. The ad man.

383
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,210
He's okay.

384
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,474
Excuse me, fellas.

385
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:06,050
Oh, just because I can't call you
doesn't mean you can't call me.

386
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,216
Hello.

387
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,501
Pack a bag. We're going to Paris.

388
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,762
- What?
- Paris.

389
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,837
Now?

390
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,706
Where'd you get that?

391
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,778
It's a bonus.

392
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,140
I'm not sure what for.

393
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,111
I bet.

394
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,149
What do you say?

395
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,343
I called Idyllwild.

396
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,751
We can have breakfast at Versailles.

397
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,487
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,026
I have a special night planned.

399
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,092
I thought you didn't make plans.

400
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,599
Is he joining us?

401
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,566
Yes. He has to.

402
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,797
He looks kind of square.

403
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,432
Kibby just came four days straight
from Juarez.

404
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,169
May I?

405
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,472
I've been thinking about this
since Port Authority.

406
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,215
Stay. You'll love it.

407
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,651
We're going to get high and listen to Miles.

408
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,814
That's your plan?

409
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,290
We can do this first and then do that.

410
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,521
It'll be a lot more fun.

411
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,565
Sit down. Relax.

412
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,566
Next to me, Icky.

413
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,629
Where did you find him?

414
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,833
You know you need to leave the Village
for a decent screw.

415
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,771
I'll take care of him.

416
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,248
Do you like it?

417
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,664
I feel like Dorothy.

418
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,964
Everything just turned to color.

419
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,266
The words.

420
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,468
You are good with the words, man.

421
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,636
Well put.

422
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:15,482
Kibby, why don't you make yourself useful
and get me a glass of water?

423
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,528
My word, I need to get one of those.

424
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,290
No, thanks.

425
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,436
Okay.

426
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,938
Maybe.

427
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,601
We realize there's no music playing.

428
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,702
Just the...

429
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,779
Good afternoon, ma'am.

430
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,257
I'm embarrassed to ask,
seeing as we all have it hard right now,

431
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,920
but is there any way
I can trouble you for a meal?

432
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,360
I'm willing to work for it.

433
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,726
Look around you.

434
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,390
We're not Christians here no more.

435
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,833
That is not true.

436
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,734
Fine, fine.

437
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,431
Work will feed your soul,

438
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,702
but there's no work left here today.

439
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,504
Come back tomorrow?

440
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,547
Nonsense.

441
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,551
You'll stay with us and eat with us,

442
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,087
and work tomorrow.

443
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,985
I will have to boil those clothes, though,

444
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,853
if you're going to sit at my table.

445
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,948
I'm not offended.

446
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,654
It would be a relief to me as well.

447
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:09,598
Dick Whitman, stop digging holes.

448
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,965
Build a fire under the cauldron.

449
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,401
Hiya, kid.

450
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,639
What did I say to you?

451
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,644
Reminds me of myself.

452
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,977
That doesn't surprise me at all.

453
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,380
So we thank You, Lord,

454
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,317
for this bounty we are about to receive

455
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,686
that we may share it with those in need.

456
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,019
Amen.

457
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,028
Thank you again.
Thank you so much.

458
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,291
This smells delicious.

459
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,458
Where are those manners from?

460
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,628
Let him eat and be on with it.

461
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,171
I'm from just east.

462
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,401
About New York, originally,
some other places.

463
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,602
Ah. New York.

464
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,476
It's how you took to being
on the bum so easy.

465
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,606
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.

466
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,445
I'm just saying I bet he don't know
which end of a weed to pull.

467
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,023
That's the truth, sir.
I only know some farm work,

468
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,388
but I've seen mills and docks and factories.

469
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,017
I've been a worker.

470
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,789
Are you a communist?

471
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,227
No.

472
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,630
Yeah, I imagine they're different, all right.

473
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,295
They take a club to the jaw
like anyone else.

474
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,532
They are souls,
but they can't be saved.

475
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,332
That's true.

476
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,503
My mom always said
that life is like a horseshoe.

477
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,844
It's fat in the middle,
open on both ends,

478
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,579
and hard all the way through.

479
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,794
Tomorrow...

480
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,767
when you've finished some work.

481
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,371
Bless you.

482
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,994
I had to see this place for myself.

483
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,030
Good.

484
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,827
It's something, huh?

485
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,595
No Bob Mitchum?

486
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,829
What are you drinking?

487
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,837
Campari with a twist.

488
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,531
You know, when I mentioned
the renovation,

489
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,371
I didn't know if you heard me.

490
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,037
I've been curious about seeing this place.

491
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,047
I'm actually involved with architects
on this department store.

492
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,776
Signage, mostly.

493
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,945
I like this room,
although I am its prime target:

494
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,283
Traveling salesman.

495
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,655
In that suit? I should say not.

496
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,355
No, I'm not one of those boys
who looks forward to a business trip

497
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,988
to escape the wife and kids.

498
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,659
I'm really a homebody.

499
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,962
But New York?

500
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,195
When you arrive,

501
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,965
and that train starts slowing down

502
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,539
and it gets all dark,

503
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,904
my heart pounds, and I think,

504
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,706
"I'm going to climb that staircase
and be in New York. "

505
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,077
I take it for granted.

506
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,514
It is a masterpiece of some kind.

507
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,712
Wherever I'm staying,
I always demand a view.

508
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,789
It's building after building.

509
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,723
Little compartments
filled with possibilities.

510
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,350
What's that from?

511
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,928
<i>42nd Street?</i>

512
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,360
What?

513
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,453
Uh, no.

514
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,760
No. I'm just saying it's...

515
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,098
it's like you can do anything.

516
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,798
I'm two ahead of you.

517
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,101
I have to eat something,

518
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,301
or I'm going to continue to rhapsodize.

519
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,672
What time is it?

520
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,282
I bet you don't have an expense account.

521
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,609
I'm not saying Peggy
doesn't have something upstairs.

522
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,044
I'm just saying at Sterling Cooper

523
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,342
things are usually happening downstairs.

524
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,111
I didn't know that.

525
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,779
My God, the whole office is here.

526
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,186
I don't see the Art Department.

527
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,316
What about those two?

528
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,930
Uh, I think I had too much to drink.

529
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,525
You are very petite.

530
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,369
Going back to the well. Interested?

531
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,291
Dance with me.

532
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,727
I don't like you like this.

533
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,816
Literally, "With flies. "

534
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,188
The espresso beans mean health, wealth,

535
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,523
and, um, happiness.

536
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,822
Seems redundant,

537
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,160
I mean, if you already
have health and wealth.

538
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,857
So, are you happy?

539
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,599
I'm one of those people

540
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,297
who thinks the minute you ask
that, you're not happy, so...

541
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,608
no.

542
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,872
You're loud, but you're shy.

543
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,447
I feel like I'm getting my fortune told.

544
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,537
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,981
Ah, it's fine.

546
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,052
So what do you want to do?

547
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,852
Uh... I don't know.

548
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,450
Maybe break off with one of the writers,

549
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,290
have my own little shop

550
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:56,265
where copy follows art
and not the other way around.

551
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,164
No, I mean my view.

552
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,668
You have to see it.

553
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,705
It's all the way to the park.

554
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,899
Of course it's dark now.

555
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,740
I don't know.

556
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,410
May I?

557
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,095
I...

558
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,927
don't know what to say.

559
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,933
It's Elliot.

560
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,697
And, Salvatore, you don't
have to say anything.

561
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,170
No, I... I just...

562
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,933
No.

563
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,945
Have another drink. Think about it.

564
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,149
Elliot,

565
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,947
I have thought about it.

566
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:54,047
I know what I want.

567
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,422
I know what I want to do.

568
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,688
I know what you're thinking.

569
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,199
I'll show you.

570
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,067
What are you afraid of?

571
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,275
Are you joking?

572
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,020
This... has been a pleasure.

573
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,735
Don, are you all right?

574
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,779
I don't know.

575
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,411
It's always the same thing!

576
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,650
It's probably the guy in 2F.

577
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,226
He uses his wife like a speed bag.

578
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,760
Oh, man.

579
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,524
I was going to truck down
for some carrot juice.

580
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,662
Wait, wait.

581
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,756
Thank you.

582
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,760
Smoke?

583
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,761
No.

584
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,128
He speaks.

585
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,260
I'm supposed to tell you
to say your prayers.

586
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,998
Praying won't help you from this place, kid.

587
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,937
Best keep your mind on your mother.

588
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,703
She'll probably look after you.

589
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,937
She ain't my momma.

590
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,504
We all wish we were
from someplace else, believe me.

591
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,550
Ain't you heard?

592
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,279
I'm a whore child.

593
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,881
No. I hadn't heard
anything about that.

594
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:11,086
You don't talk like a bum.

595
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,925
I'm not. I'm a gentleman of the rails.

596
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,556
For me, every day is brand-new.

597
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,261
Every day's a brand-new place,

598
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,895
people, what have you.

599
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,703
So you got no home.

600
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,300
That's sad.

601
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,742
What's at home?

602
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,643
I had a family once:

603
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,683
A wife, a job, a mortgage.

604
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:37,117
I couldn't sleep at night
tied to all those things.

605
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,348
Then death came to find me.

606
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,153
Did you see him?

607
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,160
Only every night.

608
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,130
So one morning, I freed myself
with the clothes on my back.

609
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,029
Good-bye.

610
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,068
Now I sleep like a stone:

611
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,036
Sometimes under the stars, the rain.

612
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,697
The roof of a barn.

613
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,434
But I sleep like a stone.

614
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,136
So where do you go?

615
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,769
Tomorrow I'll be leaving this place,

616
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,438
that's for certain.

617
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,016
If death was coming
anyplace, it's here, kid,

618
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,642
creeping around every corner.

619
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,656
Here.

620
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,124
You're an honorary.

621
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,025
This is how we talk to each other.

622
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,827
On the front gate of every house,
there's a mark.

623
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,061
It's a code, just like
you heard on the radio.

624
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,228
See...

625
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,098
That's a pie.

626
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,903
It means the food here is good.

627
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,977
This one...

628
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,672
That means watch out
for the nasty dog.

629
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:39,909
This one here...

630
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,650
That means a dishonest man lives here.

631
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,746
And this one...

632
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,822
That means tell a sad story.

633
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,263
Here.

634
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,567
Don't be scared, kid.

635
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,832
You ain't a man yet.

636
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,767
Of course.

637
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,032
What?

638
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,506
You two.

639
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,668
You're in love.

640
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,837
What?

641
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,575
That's ridiculous.

642
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:51,120
Every day I make pictures
where people appear to be in love.

643
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,156
I know what it looks like.

644
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,151
Looks like a magazine.

645
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,629
Love is bourgeois.

646
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,101
You're breaking my heart.

647
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,069
Dig. Ad man's got a heart.

648
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,732
The grownups are talking.

649
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,173
Don't defend him.

650
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,041
Toothpaste doesn't solve anything.

651
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:21,141
Dacron sure as hell won't bring back
those ten dead kids in Biloxi.

652
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,413
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine

653
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,580
and leaning up against a wall
in Grand Central

654
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:26,986
pretending you're a vagrant.

655
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,528
You know what it's like to watch
all you ants go into your hive?

656
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,091
<i>I wipe my ass with the Wall Street Journal.</i>

657
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,031
How come every time we have a party,

658
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,763
the ladies have to sit
and listen to the men talk?

659
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:41,803
Look at you...

660
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,464
satisfied,

661
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:48,102
dreaming up jingles
for soap flakes and spot remover,

662
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,975
telling yourself you're free.

663
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,948
Oh, my God. Stop talking.

664
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,450
Make something of yourself.

665
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,487
Like you?

666
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,525
You make the lie.

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,329
You invent want.

668
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,302
You're for them...

669
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,635
not us.

670
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,765
Well, I hate to break it to you,

671
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,436
but there is no big lie.

672
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,945
There is no system.

673
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:28,041
The universe is indifferent.

674
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,752
Man, why'd you have to say that?

675
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,524
Paris.

676
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,101
Now. Let's go.

677
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,965
Don.

678
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,738
No, I can't.

679
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,546
Buy yourself a car.

680
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,960
Don.

681
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,894
The cops.

682
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,229
You can't go out there.

683
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,470
You can't.

684
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,744
Good evening.

685
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,475
Wake up, Bobby.

686
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,221
Come on, kiddo.

687
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,323
Daddy.

688
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,621
Your sister's sleeping.

689
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,760
Ask me anything.

690
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,459
What?

691
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,763
Anything.

692
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,498
I'm tired.

693
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,271
Ask me.

694
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:38,508
Uh, why do lightning bugs light up?

695
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,081
I don't know.

696
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,363
But I will never lie to you.

697
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,507
Well, sir, I believe that does it.

698
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,642
I'll be on my way.

699
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:19,245
Thank you, again,
for sharing your home.

700
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,949
Good luck to you.

701
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,242
Be on your way already.

702
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,080
Good morning, Peggy.

703
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,650
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
