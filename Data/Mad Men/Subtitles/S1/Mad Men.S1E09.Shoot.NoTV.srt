1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,010
previously on mad men...

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,110
but you're the new girl and you're not much
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,210
Of course.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,470
You know who else
doesn't wear a hat?Elvis.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,920
That's what we're dealing with.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,870
Remind me to stop hiring young people.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,770
My mother passed away,recently.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,180
I guess I already said that.

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,510
I am appreciative of your talents
and I have made an effort to quantify.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,990
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,450
Dance with me.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,600
I don't like you like this.

mommy,look at that!

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,030
don draper!How are you?

18
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,030
Probably about like you.

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,390
Enduring the splendor of theorello.

20
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,370
You know,we got that
israeli tourism thing,right?

21
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,740
Mazal tov.

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,640
I ran into jim jordan from B.B.D.O.At the
athletic club with,uh,frank from Y.N.R.

23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,470
Your name came up.

24
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,630
Three millionaires in
towels in a steam room.

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,970
I don't know how to take that.

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,490
Take it as a compliment,a sign that
you're destined for greater things.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,610
I think jesus over rio was the best
tourist campaign I've seen in over 20 years.

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,200
It wasn't good enough
to land the israelis.

29
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,850
Ah,that's not you.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,420
That's the tiny store you work in.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,810
Now,if you were with me at mccann,you'd
have over 500 people at your disposal,

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,670
and that's just in new york.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,710
We can get a lot of things done.

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,780
Can it get me out of the
second half of this show?

35
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,750
All I'm saying is you've done
your time in the farm leagues.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,450
Yankee stadium is on the line.

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,020
I changed my mind.

38
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,150
I decided you deserve
a visit to the bar.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,140
Adele,this is donald draper.

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,910
If we're being introduced,I
assume that you're in advertising.

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,010
Would you both like to
talk about that some more?

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,070
Betty,my wife.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,540
Jim and adele hobart.

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,460
Hello,betty draper.

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,650
Pleasure.

46
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,630
Your husband here was about to prove that he
can speak about things other than advertising.

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,450
Oh,he's very interesting.

48
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,180
Well,then,come with me.

49
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,920
Let's get those drinks.We'll be back.

50
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,520
Champagne?

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,890
Besides getting the handsome prince,are
you,uh,an actress or something?

52
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,990
No,I'm a housewife.

53
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,150
I did do some modeling a lifetime ago.

54
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,020
I'm not surprised.

55
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,180
That is some face you've got there.

56
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,120
Anybody ever tell you you're
a dead ringer for grace kelly?

57
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,220
They used to.

58
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,410
You know what?

59
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,690
Coca-cola is deep into
this,uh,international campaign right now.

60
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,320
A european face like
yours,like grace kelly's,

61
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,650
might be a road we could go down.

62
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,970
Uh,we could put a call out
for a grace kelly type but,

63
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,310
uh,I don't think we'd come this close.

64
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,850
You say you've modeled?

65
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,830
I'm retired.

66
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,870
This is silly.

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,350
Think about it.

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,150
Your coloring with a green
bottle and an irish setter.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,770
Drink up.

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,150
It's back to tammany hall.

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,730
I like this show.

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,370
Very gay songs.

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,070
well,we'd better get back in there...

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,370
or leave.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,050
Come on.

76
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,520
Uh,it was very nice meeting both of you.

77
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,690
why didn't you want to go
to dinner with jim and adele?

78
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,080
People like jim hobart always talk business
because they have nothing else to say.

79
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,770
I could see that.

80
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,490
You know,he gave me his card.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,860
Really?

82
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,740
Tell you to put it under
my pillow or something?

83
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,190
No,actually.

84
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,100
He was talking to me about modeling.

85
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,820
Was he?

86
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,550
I don't think it was like that.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,060
He said something about
grace kelly and coca-cola.

88
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,170
Well,then there's no need
to doubt his interest then.

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,560
I did model,don.

90
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,300
Am I that wrong for coca-cola?

91
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,940
you're not wrong for anything.

92
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,450
So,are you going to go there?

93
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,400
how was theorello exclamation point?

94
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,210
It'll be six months before I can
get don back into a broadway theater.

95
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh,we ran into this agency head.

96
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,520
Apparently,he's courting don.

97
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,040
He gave me his card.

98
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,270
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,330
That's a heck of a
line.What did don say?

100
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,690
He basically said the man was
trying to sleep with one of us,

101
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,880
and he didn't like the idea of either.

102
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,350
I did do some modeling,you know.

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,740
I did not know,but I'm not surprised.

104
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,970
Carlton calls you grace kelly.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,660
Yeah,I was a model when I met don.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,800
A model in manhattan?

107
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,290
Yes.

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,940
It was exciting.

109
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,870
But when I got started,the
summer after college in italy.

110
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,220
Italy?

111
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,270
There was this italian designer.

112
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,950
Giovanni.

113
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,500
He wanted to be called johnny.

114
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,320
That's how much he loved americans.

115
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,430
Well,he loved american girls .

116
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,680
It was more of an
artist/muse relationship.

117
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,240
Okay.

118
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,040
So,he made you all this
and it was platonic?

119
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,120
No petting?Nothing?

120
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,100
Mama mia.

121
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,820
Then put my hair up like this.

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,880
And salvatore said he
had the menkens' artwork,

123
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,630
but to meet him in the art department
because you're' going to need a red pencil.

124
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,630
Any other good news?

125
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,240
I think the mail boy dropped
that off for you last night.

126
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,940
peggy,can you get me an outside line?

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,260
right away.

128
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,530
Don draper.

129
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,950
Now,why would you call
me out of the blue?

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,330
I appreciate the gesture.

131
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,430
It's not a gesture,don.It's an overture.

132
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,750
Let me tell you,you're
a hard man to run into.

133
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,010
I don't know what to say.

134
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,210
Don't say anything.

135
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,340
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.

136
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,870
The algonquin?

137
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,130
There's a small
hotel.Isn't that the song?

138
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,330
I don't know.

139
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,570
I'm not ready to wave the flag just yet.

140
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,840
What about the details?

141
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,830
I'd rather do this face to face.

142
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,860
But you already know
what you're gonna say.

143
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,720
I don't have to tell you the obvious
limitations of sterling-cooper.

144
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,130
But you're going to.

145
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,220
Do I need to be careful
here?It's a mom and pop.

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,120
Mccann-erickson is an
international company.

147
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,260
We have a network that extends
far beyond madison avenue.

148
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,860
Europe,south america.

149
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,430
We're publicly traded.We
issue dividends.

150
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,930
Small is bad.

151
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,500
Don,do you know the kind
of clients we attract?

152
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,990
Pan am,coca-cola,esso.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,320
Can you imagine the lifestyle
that goes with handling pan am?

154
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,260
It's a panty dropper.

155
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,280
Television?

156
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,840
Oh,you could be in that in
a bigger way.You know that.

157
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,570
But you want to sell corn,we
do a show about indians.

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,280
Imagine yourself in a three year
contract,35 per antum,security set in stone.

159
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,620
Sterling probably hasn't
let you break 30 yet.

160
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,100
No comment.

161
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,190
I really don't like
doing this over the phone.

162
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,510
All I can say is eventually you
come up here or you die wondering.

163
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,830
he gave me his card
right in front of don.

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,660
Well,not right in front of him,I guess.

165
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,610
Well,I told don about it.

166
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,070
I was a model,you know?

167
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,220
In fact,I met don on a photo shoot.

168
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,270
I was wearing this
russian blue fox coat.

169
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,790
He was just a copywriter
at the fur company.

170
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,510
I remember he saw that I didn't
like giving the coat back.

171
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,580
That's always the hardest part.

172
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,420
He asked me out.

173
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,580
He wasn't shy.I liked that.

174
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,110
I said no.

175
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,350
Then,three weeks later the
coat arrived at my apartment.

176
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,760
Who knows what kind of indian
trading he had to do to get it.

177
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,390
I think I only had two more
jobs,maybe three,before we got engaged.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,310
And then I got pregnant.

179
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,320
It's always a nightmare raising children
in manhattan,so wmoved to ossining.

180
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,730
Suddenly,I really felt so old.

181
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,520
Tell me more about that.

182
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,860
My mother was very concerned
about looks and weight.

183
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,170
And I've always eaten a lot.

184
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,870
And I like hot dogs.

185
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,380
My mother used to say,you're
going to get stout.

186
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,290
And then I became a
model,and she hated it.

187
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,460
Even though sue parker made $100,000
that year,my mother hated it.

188
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,080
Manhattan.

189
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,120
She called me a prostitute.

190
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,600
You're angry at your mother.

191
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,140
What?

192
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,450
Are you going to talk now?

193
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,380
You are angry at your mother.

194
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,050
Of all the things I've said in here!

195
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,030
You're sitting up.

196
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,760
You don't listen to me.

197
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,190
You don't listen to what I say,and
then out of nowhere you provoke me.

198
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,310
Tell me more about that.

199
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,810
I miss her.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,130
I understand that.

201
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,130
It's good and bad.

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,450
She wanted me to be beautiful
so I could find a man.

203
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,810
There's nothing wrong with that.

204
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,020
But then what?

205
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,940
Just sit and smoke and...

206
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,550
let it go until you're in a box?

207
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,660
I don't care why he gave me his card.

208
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,950
where'd you get this?

209
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,880
Kurt teasdale over at gilt-bascum.

210
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,400
It's already on the air.They wanted
to do it before she had the baby.

211
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,860
Am I the alone?

212
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,130
I don't understand it.

213
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,420
Because it's in spanish.

214
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,870
I recognize that finishing school voice.

215
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,150
You can't govern and
listen to that all day.

216
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,310
I'm happy to give up any spanish
speakers and hope this goes away.

217
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,940
Well,cooper thinks if kennedy
creeps up any more in the polls,

218
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,130
nixon will panic and they'll
get desperate for our efforts.

219
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,050
He wants everything in place.

220
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,610
More risk.

221
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,940
Why are we doing this
again,and out of pocket?

222
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,280
One don't question the
wishes of our clients.

223
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,580
Clients come and go,campbell.

224
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,980
Sometimes it's best to rid them
of unrealistic expectations.

225
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,150
Are you trying to say that we can't win?

226
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,090
Nixon's got an eight
point lead in the polls.

227
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,420
Not much.

228
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,520
And we still haven't figured out a way to make
an impact about the nixon campaign's involvement.

229
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,330
My marching orders
were undecided states.

230
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,330
I think a plan of attack
would make coop happy.

231
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,700
The 50-50'S.Texas,new
jersey,and illinois.

232
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,130
No
- it's easy to just say that,isn't it?

233
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,040
I think women will hate her.

234
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,700
It's like their better looking
sister marries a handsome senator

235
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,980
and she's going to
live in the white house.

236
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,850
I'm practically jealous.

237
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,840
I called.

238
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,240
I assumed you were staying in the city.

239
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,790
The girl.

240
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,100
We gave her a little extra
work and now she's distracted.

241
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,700
Look at that.

242
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,750
It's raw,don.

243
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,800
Don,I realized something today.

244
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,970
I miss modeling.

245
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,270
You always told me you hated it.

246
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Maybe the passing of time
has made me feel differently.

247
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,080
Maybe it's jim hobart.

248
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,760
So what?

249
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,200
It's still an opportunity.

250
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,060
You want to go back to work?

251
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,510
A few days.I mean,is that so bad?

252
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,100
I get paid.

253
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,170
I can get ethel to watch the kids.

254
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,740
She watches them half the time now.

255
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,090
Well,that's three four-hour stretches.

256
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,960
I think it would be fun to
go in and be that girl again.

257
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,990
You're serious?

258
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,450
There will still be ham.I promise.

259
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,300
Are you resolved?

260
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,700
Is this even worth arguing?

261
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,190
No,it's not like that.

262
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,460
It's just something I'd like to do.

263
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,770
Well,I can't stop you from
doing what you want to do.

264
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,360
you have no idea how
boring it is around here.

265
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,710
Really?

266
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,340
I would think one hour on the sterling-cooper
switchboard would be a russian novel.

267
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,990
They told me it would happen,but the
truth is you really just stop listening.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,260
And put ice on your wrists.

269
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,740
Peggy,do you need to go home?

270
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,840
What?

271
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,530
The sweater.

272
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,080
Are you having one of those days?

273
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,540
It's not that.

274
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,930
I'd like to go home,but
I just don't think I can.

275
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,530
Then what is it?

276
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,960
You're not helping your silhouette.

277
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,350
I ripped my skirt.

278
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,450
You don't have a needle and thread?

279
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,200
It's a big rip.

280
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,930
Oh,honey.

281
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,340
I've got a spare outfit
squirreled away.You can borrow it.

282
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,220
Not exactly dressed for that,are we?

283
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,200
I've lost men like you before,

284
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,080
and usually it had to do with
my unexpressed confidence.

285
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,950
I think you're one in a million,draper.

286
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,370
Those are nice clubs.

287
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,920
That bonus from cooper
must've made you happy.

288
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,640
It was designed as a kind of an
armor against men like jim hobart.

289
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,940
How'd you hear about it?

290
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,350
I saw those clubs going down the
hallway.I thought they were for me.

291
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,870
They're from jim hobart.

292
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,730
What did he offer?

293
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,740
Bigger.

294
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,110
The world,basically.

295
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,700
Well,it can't just be a number and a
salary because you know we're open to that.

296
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,750
Pan am.

297
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,160
Pan am?

298
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,290
It is not mccann-erickson.

299
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,010
Big talent attracts big clients.

300
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,030
We can try and make that happen here.

301
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,390
That's true.

302
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,060
But don't be fooled.

303
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,850
You hear pan am you imagine london,holed up
at the dorchester with three stewardesses.

304
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,740
The truth is it's more like a 20-hour boomerang
flight so you can make a coupon sing in spanish.

305
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,490
And when you have stockholders like mccann does you can't fire clients
- I know you'll hate that.

306
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,890
I thought about leaving once.

307
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,220
But,you know,it's daunting.

308
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,800
Why entertain the prospect of failure?

309
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,060
That's a sad thought.

310
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,670
No,made me look at this place.

311
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,300
I don't want to sound sentimental,but
it's not just accounts.

312
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,720
Look around here at what you have.

313
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,180
You want to start over?

314
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,060
I haven't made up my mind.

315
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,670
I'm taking this very personally.

316
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,110
Why?

317
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,000
It's business.

318
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,830
Is it?

319
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,760
Mccann-erickson is the major leagues.

320
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,570
Good.Let him go.

321
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,300
You're right.

322
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,520
Maybe he'll take me with him.

323
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,340
Can you imagine the money?

324
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,830
I heard he's making 30 already.

325
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,090
He's not ten times better than me.

326
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,780
You love him.

327
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,130
Everybody loves him.

328
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,770
Sure,his moods and the way he talks.

329
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,610
I don't even know what
he's saying half the time.

330
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,380
Clients do.

331
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,730
I'll admit,she crossed my mind once.

332
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,760
She's having a very bad freshman year.

333
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,280
They went nuts for her writing.

334
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,940
Belle jolie,she did that.

335
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,350
Belle jolie was okay.

336
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,710
She obviously let it go to
her head,and other places.

337
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,840
Naw,I don't think it's the job.

338
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,660
I think we're seeing the real her.

339
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,020
It's one of those girls who
slimmed down before she got here.

340
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,110
Now she's here and there she is.

341
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,450
Who thinks about her?

342
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,370
Maybe she'll go with draper too.

343
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,280
It's a tragedy.

344
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,270
A piece of fruit that
went real bad real fast,

345
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,860
and no one ever got to eat it.

346
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,700
Well,I got some work to do.

347
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,860
Suddenly,upon news of other success
a young man is filled with ambition.

348
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,260
Drop dead.

349
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,410
Harry,you busy?

350
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,790
Well,hello.I can't believe this.

351
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,370
I'm sorry I,uh,overdid it.

352
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
You're out of the business a
few years and things change.

353
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,630
Please,I'm overwhelmed
with the style of you.

354
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,460
Betty draper meet ronnie gidridge.

355
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,480
He handles the art for coca-cola.

356
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,370
He's also my
brother-in-law.

357
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,560
It is a pleasure.

358
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,540
Look at her.

359
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,770
What did I say?

360
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,550
You ready to work?

361
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,210
I'm excited.

362
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,630
It's not that complicated.

363
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,500
He's either gonna tell you to think
about something else or just stand there.

364
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,210
Jim thinks everyone else's job is easy.

365
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,300
Shall we.

366
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,730
Mrs.Draper,it's just a tryout.

367
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,910
No guarantees.

368
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,180
I told you,I've done this before.

369
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,780
Now,where did you get that dress?

370
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,850
So,basically,whereas sea corp previously
spent their money on local print and radio,

371
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,600
we increase the network buy to
30%,more points for each dollar.

372
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,660
Sea corp laxatives.

373
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,640
You know,I have to talk to those people.

374
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,140
They're not what you would expect.

375
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,160
They have absolutely no sense
of humor about their product.

376
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,190
Who knew that college was gonna get
me out of the army and into laxatives?

377
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,450
College was the moment,wasn't it?

378
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,720
Fun and games,and girls.

379
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,450
Were you in a frat?

380
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,420
Alpha delta phi.

381
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,790
Also known as cut ups.

382
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,110
We were the cut ups.

383
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,860
We had this stray
dalmatian,our mascot,mamie.

384
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,130
So,it died,and in classic fraternity
manner we decided to throw a party.

385
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,930
Mamie's funeral.

386
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,250
One of the pledges pipes
in that our rivals,si-u

387
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,880
they are so gung ho.

388
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,310
Si-u is throwing a beauty pageant parade on
main street with the girl school down the road.

389
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,980
Now,my friend,chip-
he's a lawyer now- says,

390
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,710
why don't we go down
there and get a permit,

391
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,650
throw a grand funeral for mamie,

392
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,910
and let the girls run away crying?

393
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,890
That's great.

394
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,170
Did you do it?

395
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,520
We had police barricades and 30
brothers following that pledge

396
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,350
who had the honor of pulling
mamie in a radio flyer.

397
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,100
That's beautiful.

398
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,230
Idiots.

399
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,290
Wait a minute.

400
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,130
Nixon and kennedy are both buying
up airtime in these undecided states.

401
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,540
It's an arms race.

402
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,810
Nixon buys,kennedy matches.

403
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,240
So,if we can't increase nixon's
presence,we can decrease kennedy'S.

404
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,860
How do we that?

405
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,110
We make big buys in new jersey,illinois,and
wherever for sea corp laxatives.

406
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,980
Well,hold on.

407
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,030
So,nixon's selling laxatives?

408
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,940
No.

409
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,820
We're selling laxatives,nixon's
selling nixon,.

410
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,530
and kennedy's watching mamie's funeral

411
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,980
This is scary.

412
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,330
It is,isn't it?

413
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,400
It was for me.

414
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,470
Who was it?

415
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,900
I'm the girl
- the girl with the cola.

416
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,940
It's only a couple of days work.

417
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,310
You know,just a couple of photo
shoots and then some kind of testing.

418
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,800
But I guess you know how it works.

419
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,310
I do.

420
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,630
Don't worry.I'm not gonna ruin this.

421
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,230
I'm very happy for you.

422
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,360
I know you don't like it,

423
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,310
but I know you're a
little bit proud of me.

424
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,490
Come upstairs.

425
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,520
No.

426
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,200
Right here.

427
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,180
Okay.

428
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,780
how are these open already?

429
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,910
Well,betty,we don't want life
to look difficult,now do we?

430
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,650
You're too much.

431
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,910
no!No!

432
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,890
- Polly,no!
- Let her go.

433
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,750
If I see that dog in my yard
again,I'm gonna shoot it.

434
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,620
I see you got there
and back in one piece.

435
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,230
Yes.

436
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,640
And even though I got lost,I
sent ethel home at four.

437
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,260
They went to the park and
to visit ernie at francine'S.

438
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,580
All in all,everyone had a nice day.

439
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
So,how was it?

440
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,820
There was this man,ronnie.

441
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,060
I don't even know what his job is.

442
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,900
Ronnie gidridge.

443
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,590
He's the art
director-- I met him.

444
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,430
He is such a character.

445
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,590
He tells funny stories.

446
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,670
I brought the form home.

447
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,580
I thought you could help me
fill it out so I can get paid.

448
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,170
I'd love to.

449
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
sweetie pie?

450
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,340
What happened?

451
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,960
I had a bad dream.

452
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,960
Get in bed with daddy.

453
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,050
What was your dream?

454
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,170
I don't want anyone to shoot polly.

455
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
No one's gonna do that,honey.

456
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,820
Yes,mr.Ford said he would because
polly ate one of his doves.

457
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,150
They're pigeons.

458
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,890
He said this to you in your dream?

459
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,350
No.He said it today when
polly ate the birdie.

460
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,810
He wasn't hurt that bad.He could fly.

461
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,040
No one is gonna hurt polly.

462
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,760
Now they can't play in the yard?

463
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,540
I'm gonna get my robe on and go over
there and find out what happened.

464
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,130
Two in the morning.

465
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,080
He's our neighbor.He'll make it worse.

466
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,370
I'll talk to him.

467
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,810
You should have ethel talk to him.

468
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,860
Don,they play in the
yard when I'm here too.

469
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,580
And she didn't tell you?

470
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm sure they didn't tell her.

471
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,930
They probably wouldn't
have told me either.

472
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,840
They'll be over at francine's
for the next shoot anyway.

473
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,490
It's one day.

474
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

475
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,620
Maybe not.

476
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,500
She's never slept well.

477
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,030
That's not true.

478
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,920
Did you see those big tears?

479
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,790
I really want to get a
picture of her crying one day.

480
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,510
I have to say,don,lucky strike even
in this lawsuit is stronger than ever.

481
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,370
It was a brilliant campaign.

482
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,580
Like some supersonic jet
flying right over the market.

483
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,280
I was there.Great work.

484
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,250
Thank you.

485
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,740
Sorry to interrupt
- who is responsible?

486
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,380
We've made a significant commitment for as
yet unproduced sea corp laxative commercials.

487
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,560
This didn't go by me.

488
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,560
No.It went by bob wilkins
in media right to me.

489
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,590
Who is responsible?

490
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,810
Uh,mr.Cooper sir,it was me.

491
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,000
You thought of this?

492
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,670
Well,uh
- I bear some of the responsibility as well.

493
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,760
What did they do?

494
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,530
Every commercial block on air

495
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:48,190
in the land of lincoln is
clogged up with laxative buys.

496
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,140
And a little bit of nixon time.

497
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,580
The kennedy people won't know
what to do with themselves.

498
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,130
They're going to have to put
his pretty face on the radio,

499
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,740
and with that accent.

500
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,750
Nicely done.

501
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,200
I didn't think you had
it in you,and I mean that.

502
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,980
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

503
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,920
Inspired.

504
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,920
Congratulations,boys.

505
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,520
Peggy,you want to write that down?

506
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,430
Don said congratulations.

507
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,340
Are we done here?

508
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,560
No.

509
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,410
I really thought it was
gonna go bad for a minute.

510
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,550
Oh,I was sure it would.

511
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,280
No kidding.

512
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,470
You almost let me detonate
1,000 feet from the ground.

513
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,440
So much for camaraderie.

514
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,940
Mr.Rumson sent this over.

515
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,220
Unopened!Very nice.

516
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,090
Hildi?Stay.Have a drink.

517
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,340
It's an order.

518
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,100
No,thank you.

519
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,450
I'm going to my parents after work.

520
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,470
You know,when something good
happens to me,it also happens to you.

521
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,660
I know that.

522
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,940
I said congratulations.

523
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,340
You should do something
with that sourpuss.

524
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,540
You're very beautiful.

525
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Just being honest.

526
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,100
I love watching you walk.

527
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,980
I should go.

528
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,730
you should.

529
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,670
is he in?

530
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,570
Always nice to see you.

531
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,730
I can give you my assurance that
nothing good will happen to that boy,

532
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,110
though I can't seem to keep
my word on that,hard as I try.

533
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,350
I might ask you to take me with you.

534
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,330
I see no reason to leave.

535
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,910
Or maybe I see a million.

536
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,940
A million?

537
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,590
Is that what it's gonna cost me?

538
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,140
I was thinking more like 40.

539
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,190
45 is good.

540
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,380
I'm not gonna be a little girl
and ask you why you stayed.

541
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,610
I know it's not money,and I hope it's
not to keep your foot on pete campbell.

542
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,130
I like the way you do business.

543
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,520
Well,I try to be as
civilized as you can be.

544
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,820
No contract.

545
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,100
45 and no security.

546
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,230
Well,what's in it for me?

547
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,550
If I leave this place one day,

548
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,300
it will not be for more advertising.

549
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,890
What else is there?

550
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,990
I don't know.Life being lived.

551
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,420
I'd like to stop talking
about it and get back to it.

552
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
I've worked with a lot of men like you,

553
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,480
and if you had to choose a place to die
it would be in the middle of a pitch.

554
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,570
I've done that.

555
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,400
I want to do something else.

556
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,900
jim hobart,mccann-erickson.

557
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,300
Of course.

558
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,730
line one.

559
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,790
Don!

560
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,890
Incredible pictures.Am I wrong?

561
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,060
No,you're not.

562
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,070
So,your wife's already here with us.

563
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,430
I know she's happy.

564
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,220
Why don't you join her?

565
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,410
I don't know about that,jim.

566
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,240
You can do better than that.

567
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,190
You know what I'm offering here?

568
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,470
It's yankee stadium.I know.

569
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,730
What?Did sterling come to the rescue?

570
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,840
Is it about money?I have to
say I might've judged you wrong.

571
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,980
It's not.

572
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,390
I'm surprised.

573
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,210
I thought your wife coming
here meant you were interested.

574
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,790
No,that was her idea.

575
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,140
Can't blame me for trying.

576
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,420
Maybe not but,uh...

577
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,000
can't exactly say that
was a big league move.

578
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,900
All's fair.

579
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,980
No stone unturned,right?

580
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,010
It's a pity to lose both of you.

581
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,770
You're a very lucky
man landing that woman.

582
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,090
What's going on with mr.Draper?

583
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,910
Even if I knew,I wouldn't tell you.

584
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,840
Very good.

585
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,450
I've been meaning to
give this back to you.

586
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,710
I had it completely dry cleaned.

587
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,980
Why don't you keep it?

588
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,000
Have it taken in here and let out there.

589
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,760
It's your dress.

590
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,070
Hot tea.That's a good idea.

591
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,240
What are you talking about?

592
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,020
Peggy,you are falling prey to a
very common situation for new girls.

593
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,490
I'm not new anymore.

594
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,940
Well,that's just it.

595
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,440
Don't you want to do well here?

596
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm the first girl to do any
writing in this office since the war.

597
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,740
Marge told me.

598
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,320
Writing?

599
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,040
Is that what this is about?

600
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,720
I thought you were doing
that to get close to paul.

601
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,770
Thank you again.

602
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,980
I heard you were being
considered for an account

603
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,570
because a client's wife saw you and thought
it would be okay if he worked with you.

604
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,770
You know,you're not a stick!

605
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,140
And yet I never wonder
what men think of me.

606
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,220
You are hiding a very attractive
young girl with too much lunch.

607
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,410
I know what men think of you.

608
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,610
That you're looking for a husband,and
you're fun,and not in that order.

609
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,690
Peggy,this isn't china.There's
no money in virginity.

610
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,870
I'm not a virgin.

611
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,260
No,of course not.

612
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,520
I just realized something.

613
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,640
You think you're being helpful.

614
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Well,I am trying,dear.

615
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm going home.

616
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,290
Did you have a good day?

617
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,310
I did.

618
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,960
It was splendid.

619
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,450
Well,betty,I have some
good news and some bad news.

620
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,890
There's bad news?

621
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,560
The client's moving the
international work to london.

622
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,560
More audrey hepburn,less grace kelly.

623
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,810
I see.

624
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,570
As for us,well,we're going
back to the malt shop.

625
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,480
The good news is you have two wonderful
sets of pictures to start your book again.

626
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,770
That's true.

627
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,600
I really am sorry.

628
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,870
This was fun.

629
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,640
You can keep the dress
and the hairstyle.

630
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't do that for everyone.

631
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,850
Oh,honey,it has nothing to do with you.

632
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,330
What do you think,paul?

633
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,640
Should we move this whole
thing down to macdougal street?

634
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,280
Doing great here.

635
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,260
good,she left.

636
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,540
Probably wasn't gonna
happen for her tonight.

637
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,330
Depends how much we drink.

638
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,390
How drunk do you have to be?

639
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,580
My brother works at the exchange.

640
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,940
They call a girl like her a lobster.

641
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,930
All the meat's in the tail.

642
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,470
are they giving you guys a bonus?

643
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,830
Will you calm down?

644
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,660
Drop you at the statn?

645
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,790
Sure.

646
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,250
campbell,you sucker punched me.

647
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,140
What is wrong with you?

648
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,370
Come on.

649
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,790
You just had a fight
and I was not part of it.

650
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,290
Either you two make up,or I
do not stand a chance tonight.

651
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,790
perfect timing.

652
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,940
The children are down,but only because
they were running around all day.

653
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,770
They fell asleep in front of the tv.

654
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,370
How did it go today?

655
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,610
Good.Fun.

656
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,800
They were talking about a whole
string of other possibilities for me.

657
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,190
But honestly,I don't think
I want to work anymore.

658
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,180
I don't like you coming home to some...

659
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,390
whipped together mess of
whatever's left in the fridge.

660
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,580
And frankly,I don't
like manhattan on my own.

661
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,200
It's harsh.

662
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,760
It can be.

663
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,320
And what am i going to do?

664
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:51,600
Run around the city with my book like
some teenager making a fool of myself?

665
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,060
If that's what you want,

666
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,020
and it's my job to
give you what you want.

667
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,490
You do.

668
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,530
Look at all this.

669
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,120
I don't know what I was thinking.

670
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,350
Birdie,

671
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,420
you know I don't care
about making my dinner

672
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,630
or taking in my shirts.

673
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,570
You have a job.

674
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,870
You're a mother to
those two little people

675
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,060
and you are better at it
than anyone else in the world.

676
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:40,910
At least in the top 500.

677
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,160
I would've given anything to
have had a mother like you.

678
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,550
Beautiful,and kind,and filled
with love like an angel.

679
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,030
You're sweet.

680
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,530
And this does not taste whipped up.

681
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,150
No.

682
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,910
It's good,isn't it?

683
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,540
have a good day,daddy.

684
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,940
You,too.

685
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,170
We're going to the community
center to watch them fill the pool.

686
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,070
That sounds fun.

687
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,010
Have a good day.

688
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,510
I already am.

689
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,450
Mommy,I'm eating.

690
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,610
be careful!Don't jump off the bed.

691
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,760
okay!

692
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,120
mrs.Draper!

693
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,900
What the hell are you doing?

694
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,710
Mrs.Draper!

695
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:02,660


696
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,980
