Mad Men 2x8
<i>A Night to Remember</i>

2
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,588
When did you get up?

3
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:33,162
I don't know.

4
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,877
Is it still Saturday?

5
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,393
I need you to fix the
outlet in the dining room.

6
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:43,198
I thought you were going to
call an electrician.

7
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,651
All you need to do to is unscrew
the fuse and replace the plug.

8
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,446
Sounds like you could do it.

9
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,283
I need to be able
to plug in the hot plate.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,670
Bets, come here.

11
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,645
Look, you've got a week
before this party.

12
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,915
It doesn't have to be a big deal.

13
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:11,718
Carla will help you.

14
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:14,020
We're going to have
a house full of people.

15
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,707
I'd appreciate it if you'd take care
of the things on the list.

16
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:19,225
Birdie, I'll fix it.

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,928
Thank you.

18
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,900
Hello.

19
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,239
Perfect timing. Ma just left.

20
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,962
I brought colored pencils
for the boys.

22
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:43,169
They're out back throwing rocks
at our laundry.

23
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,834
How is he?

24
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,429
I don't know.

25
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,553
I told you about the chiropractor.

26
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:51,421
- They're not doctors.
- Did I tell you he cried?

27
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,181
- Anita...
- Sometimes I think

28
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:54,886
about Mike Ryan. Remember him?

29
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:57,362
Stop it. Gerry has a job.

30
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:58,600
He hates it.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,935
He told me he hated it, and then
a week later his back started.

32
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,729
His buddies from work
don't even come by anymore.

33
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,774
They think he's a malinger.

34
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,284
Ann Ma... all she can talk
about are her bunions.

35
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,905
I checked out the next
Horatio Hornblower for him.

36
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:16,804
I was right. There is
only one book about Moby Dick.

37
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,374
Him with the books.

38
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,201
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

39
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,901
Hello, Father.
What a pleasant surprise.

40
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,869
I'm sorry for dropping in. I just
thought that he could use a visit.

41
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,803
- Bless you.
- How is he?

42
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,304
Much better, thanks.

43
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,974
Good, good, I'm glad.

44
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,553
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

45
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,977
- Let me see if he's awake.
- No, please don't disturb him.

46
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,062
Nonsense. He'll be thrilled.

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,711
It means a lot
that you're visiting.

48
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,616
You as well, I'm sure.

49
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:54,866
Are you hungry?

50
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,056
I've already been
fed a few times today.

51
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,243
- It's a wonderful community, you know?
- It is.

52
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,932
I see you at church,

53
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,124
but you don't seem
very comfortable.

54
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,751
No. That's not true.

55
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:11,838
You don't participate.
You keep to yourself.

56
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:18,431
You know, there are
many ways to be involved.

57
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,001
There's a committee
for the CYO dance.

58
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,368
And for selfish reasons,

59
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:25,431
I would love to take advantage
of your professional services again.

60
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,770
- What do you mean?
- Publicity.

61
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,833
Last year's poster was girls
in garlands dancing around a maypole.

62
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:34,110
I don't think that's what
the kids want.

63
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,112
No. They don't.

64
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,907
I'm so busy right now, Father.

65
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,763
Think of it as pro bono.

66
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,403
Talk to your boss.

67
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,621
I really would like the kids
to show up.

68
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,664
He's ready to see you, Father.

69
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,007
I'll get you the specifics.

70
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,790
As of today, you are
costing this company

71
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,613
more than you are making it.

72
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,676
Excuse me?

73
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,555
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.
Apparently, last night,

74
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,787
their switchboard lit up
like a Christmas tree.

75
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,964
- I didn't hear...
- You're the head of the Tv dpt

76
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,734
so I know you can't
watch everything.

77
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:11,189
But who exactly oversaw the placement
of Maytag in the ABC Sunday Night Movie?

78
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,727
I take full responsibility.

79
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,769
There was a scene with
a murderous Russian spy

80
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,908
who was referred to
as an agitator repeatedly,

81
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,726
and this led into a Maytag spot,

82
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:25,286
the title of which is
"The Amazing Agitator."

83
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:27,914
Really?

84
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,750
Is this all a big joke to you?

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,637
The Russians are still
our enemy, you know?

86
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:33,252
This will not happen again.

87
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,352
Crane, we're eating this one.

88
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,160
Politics aside,
you need to be aware

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,972
that a client will take
any excuse not to pay us.

90
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,473
You need to get your department in line,
or I'll gut it.

91
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,847
Yes, sir. I'll get to
the bottom of this.

92
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:56,465
Hey, Harry, what's the name
of that place we went to

93
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,159
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?

94
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,908
I don't remember. Can one of
you help me read TV scripts?

95
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,908
- For money?
- I don't think so.

96
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,920
There's too much to read,
and I have nobody.

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,336
There are things to do
that I didn't know were my job.

98
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,455
How could that be?
You made that job up.

99
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,160
I thought it would be a liaison
between the networks and the agency

100
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,032
and, I don't know, buy time.

101
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,908
That's what your job was before.

102
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,965
So now what?
It's a whole nother job.

103
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,509
That's why we have juniors.
Someone to blame.

104
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:25,563
You need someone to lay down on the
barbed wire so you can run over them.

105
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,908
Heineken was pleased but confused.

106
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,846
By the fact that you
don't use their product?

107
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,860
That's why I brought Campbell.

108
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,820
So what's the problem?

109
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,704
They're set on competing
at the tap.

110
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:44,159
We just have to find a way

111
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,959
to excite your average tavern inhabitant,
and they'll be happy.

112
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,457
Did you explain to them that there's
a market that's actually excited

113
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,527
about Heineken being imported?

114
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:55,334
For women entertaining in the home,
Holland is Paris.

115
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:57,378
They can buy
this sophisticated beer

116
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,519
and proudly walk it into the kitchen
instead of hiding it in the garage.

117
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,458
I'm just telling you
I sensed resistance.

118
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,444
If you want to get some research, I'll
get them into a room with you again.

119
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,170
We'll go up and down the Hudson,
northern New Jersey,

120
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,770
Connecticut... the cash belt...

121
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,749
set up a few end-aisle displays at
the A&Ps, away from the other beer,

122
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:18,316
surrounded by cheese and crackers
and toothpicks with cellophane tips.

123
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,147
We can try that.
Maybe short, uneven stacks.

124
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:24,338
Make it look popular.
Plus, housewives love green.

125
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,961
We'll go make some calls.

126
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:28,996
You're still going to have to sit down
and sell this to them.

127
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,615
By the way, I hate
to disappoint your wife,

128
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,832
but I don't know
about Sunday night.

129
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,990
I'd worry more about
disappointing Roger.

130
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,960
He seemed to think it was important
that we sit down with Crab Colson.

131
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,835
And believe me, I'm sure my wife
would rather go see a movie.

132
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,305
Who's Crab Colson?

133
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,391
Rogers & Cowan.

134
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,585
<i>Mr. Sterling is here to see you.</i>

135
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,609
Send him in, please.

136
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,339
- Roger.
- Crane.

137
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,999
Mitch says you want
to expand your department.

138
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,097
Looks pretty big already.

139
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,981
The way other television dpt
have the set up****

140
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,697
and I've checked have
on this... up...

141
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,062
there should be a dedicated man
for Broadcast Operations.

142
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,689
And what is he dedicated to?

143
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,446
Reading scripts, meetings
to discuss.

144
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm really the face of the television
department for the clients.

145
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,697
Have you noticed we're full up?
Who's going to pay this person, you?

146
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,066
The money we save avoiding surprises
will make it worthwhile.

147
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,161
- You smoke, Crane?
- Sometimes.

148
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,938
How do I know you're not
just goldbricking?

149
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:41,061
Because that's what Mitch thinks.

150
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,836
I don't want to speak out of turn...

151
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,137
Warren, do you mind?

152
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,636
I don't think Mitch has been very happy
with my recent promotion.

153
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,222
- Are you?
- Yes, of course.

154
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,975
Figure out a way
to do the job yourself.

155
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:04,799
You better not repeat
any of that to Mitch.

156
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:14,291
Peggy Olsen's office.

157
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:17,328
May I speak with Miss Olsen?
This is Father John Gill calling.

158
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,043
Peggy Olsen speaking.

159
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,542
Hello, Peggy.
This is Father John Gill.

160
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:28,638
- Do you have a minute?
- Yes. Did you get the flyer?

161
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,572
<i>Yes.</i>

162
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,733
It's good,

163
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:34,339
but can you take whatever
this is and make it into a poster?

164
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,598
What do you mean, whatever this is?

165
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:40,184
Well, there's been some discussion.

166
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:43,136
Don't you like it?

167
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,941
The CYO committee is curious
about "A Night to Remember."

168
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,443
What's the problem?

169
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,197
Well, they feel it sends
the wrong message to the girls.

170
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:56,866
It's wholesome and romantic.

171
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,620
And you have to get the girls.
It's the only way the boys will come.

172
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,208
Tell them that this is the way it works,
and I know better than them.

173
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,254
Peggy, couldn't you
just speak with them?

174
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,126
<i>They just want to feel involved.</i>

175
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:15,594
Of course. I'd love
to hear their thoughts.

176
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,264
- <i>Good-bye, Father.</i>
- Good-bye.

177
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:29,692
Mr. Crane, may I be
of some assistance?

178
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,415
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,862
What?

180
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,920
I received a memo
from Mr. Sterling's office,

181
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,451
saying that you need a girl
to help you with your workload.

182
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,871
No, it's not exactly
what I asked for.

183
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,263
I don't know what you had in mind,
but we are spread very thin.

184
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,711
- Hello, Joan.
- Hello, Warren.

185
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,588
You...

186
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,591
You look great today.

187
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:55,576
Thank you, Warren.

188
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,795
I need someone to run
our commercial scripts

189
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,731
past the networks for approval.

190
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:03,170
- Can't you just use a messenger?
- No. That person also has to read

191
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,578
the network scripts for me

192
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,437
and really make sure are
clients aren't misrepresented.

193
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,958
I don't feel comfortable sending
my girls out of the building,

194
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,230
but I will find someone
to read the scripts.

195
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,445
My wife is pregnant.

196
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,621
I just want to get out
of here at a reasonable hour.

197
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:17,176
How many are there?

198
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,649
And what are they looking for?

199
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,670
We just want to nip
any problems in the bud.

200
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,668
For example, if a kid's pushing
away his dinner in disgust,

201
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,243
just make sure it's not
Gorton's fish sticks.

202
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:31,265
You know, people can't be coughing
and dying right before a Lucky ad.

203
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:32,980
Things like that.
It's common sense, really.

204
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,293
It sounds interesting.

205
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,521
It is. For the first few.

206
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,733
And there's Maytag in there.

207
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,203
They're very sensitive
to Communism.

208
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,323
Why can't I do that?

209
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:51,067
- Because you already have a job.
- No. I mean talk to her like that.

210
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,109
She's so much woman.

211
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,648
- You are so graceful.
- She is adorable.

212
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:36,238
They're doing Winnie the Pooh this year.
She's going to be Piglet.

213
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,458
It's all very professional-looking.

214
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,282
Cheryl's 14. She won't even
waltz on my feet anymore.

215
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:42,962
Ours is engaged.

216
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,202
Enjoy it while you can.

217
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:47,944
Crab, can I get you
another one of those?

218
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:50,963
Like the song says,
I'd be a fool to say no.

219
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,325
- Roger?
- Ladies first.

220
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,155
All right, the evening show is over.

221
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,367
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.

222
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,925
Good night.

223
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,218
Good night.

224
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,904
- Good night, slugger.
- Good night.

225
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,024
Hello.

226
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,309
Hello, Mrs. Draper.

227
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:09,537
Betty.

228
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,529
These are beautiful.

229
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,731
I'm sorry I'm late.
My date cancelled.

230
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,664
You should have called.
I might have been able to replace her.

231
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:21,065
Carla, would you please
put these in water?

232
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,573
And our head count is now seven.

233
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,654
What a lovely home.

234
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:26,933
Hello, Duck.

235
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,339
- I remember you, Sally.
- Hello.

236
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:33,029
- And who do we have here?
- This is Bobby.

237
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,199
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips'hand.

238
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,185
Do you like baseball, Bobby?

239
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,900
Come on. Let's go to bed.

240
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,905
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't want to come stag.

241
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:45,979
Nobody cares.

242
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,513
I don't know. My wife
hated odd numbers.

243
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,663
Well, hello, there.

244
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,606
- Duck Phillips, you know Mona.
- Of course.

245
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:56,776
Hello.

246
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:00,262
Of course this is Petra
and Crab Colson.

247
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,113
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.

248
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,467
- Can I get you something?
- Tomato juice, if you have it.

249
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,637
Oh, come on.

250
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,780
I'll have something with dinner.

251
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,094
Beautiful drive.

252
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:13,962
- Did you take the Sawmill?
- I did.

253
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,343
Found myself heading
to New Rochelle by accident.

254
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,841
- I used to live there.
- It's lovely there.

255
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,093
I'll tell you the way to go.
We're taking our sloop

256
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,404
from my folks'place in Old Lyme

257
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:24,218
all the way down to
Larchmont for Race Week.

258
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,968
We should get a boat.

259
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,514
My father had a boat.
Almost killed him.

260
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,591
You might as well
cut a hole in your pocket.

261
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,156
The slip and the dry dock
and the yacht club.

262
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,716
Speaking of which, Don,

263
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,657
are you and Bets joining
Willow Oaks or not?

264
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:37,815
We're lonely.

265
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,717
If you wish, you can
leave your drinks here

266
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:42,152
and join us in the ding room.

267
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,527
Terrific.

268
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:48,426
So, Rogers & Cowan.
It's a good place to be right now.

269
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:54,115
He does everything you
need him to do, you know?

270
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:59,253
How did that get there?

271
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,739
We're going to take a little
trip around the world,

272
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,909
starting in Spain with gazpacho,

273
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,022
followed by Japan... rumaki...

274
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,055
and then we'll stop
by Duchess County

275
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:14,554
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,
accompanied by egg noodles,

276
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,740
the way my grandmother
made them from Germany.

277
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,231
And we have a choice
of burgundy from France

278
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:22,151
or a frosty glass
of beer from Holland.

279
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:26,246
Did you bring a case from work?

280
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:27,742
- No.
- Please, Draper.

281
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,552
You'll do anything
to win an argument.

282
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,122
I don't understand.

283
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:34,010
You went out and bought
that? At the store?

284
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:37,696
Carla did some of the marketing,
but no, I did. Why?

285
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm not ever allowed
to pick where I sit.

286
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:45,883
What's so funny?

287
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:49,178
Crab, if you want to be in business
with someone who knows their stuff...

288
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,160
Heineken is one of our clients.

289
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,867
He said you were the market,
and you are.

290
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,798
- That is funny.
- Incredible.

291
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,751
At an interesting experiment.

292
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,192
I have to sit down.

293
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:04,637
Please do.

294
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,782
Now who wants wine?

295
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,074
Please start.

296
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,275
The soup is delicious.

297
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:23,003
To our hosts.

298
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,663
And their idyllic country home

299
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,463
and to new friends.

300
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:29,862
Hear, hear.

301
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:40,384
"A night to remember"
is every girls dream.

302
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,575
It holds the wholesome promise
of the kind of hand-holding

303
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,484
that eventually leads to marriage.

304
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,496
I think it's exactly
what we talked about.

305
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:52,492
I don't like the way
they're dancing.

306
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,462
They're too close together.

307
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:57,454
Maybe leave some room
for the Holy Ghost.

308
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:00,489
Maybe they're doing a box step.

309
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,502
Fine.

310
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:06,964
You're not worried about having
a dance full of girls only?

311
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:08,966
When the boys hear
that the girls are going...

312
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:12,010
Boys aren't going to hear nothing.
They don't go to school together.

313
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,929
They go to church together.

314
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,473
And this isn't the first CYO event.

315
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,910
That's true.

316
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd never thought about that,
but you're right.

317
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,867
I'm just saying I'm not an expert,

318
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,898
but there might be another slogan.

319
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:28,679
What do you want, two flyers?

320
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:31,697
No. We don't have to throw
this one away,

321
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,533
but maybe we can...

322
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:38,662
I think she's saying maybe
we should try something else.

323
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,469
Thank you very much.
I'll see what I can do.

324
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,500
You're such a doll.

325
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,843
Could I speak to you a minute?

326
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:56,096
Father, I wanted to talk
to you too.

327
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,180
We can speak tomorrow.

328
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,250
Thank you all for your
generosity and your time.

329
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,241
Father, I don't mind working,

330
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,459
but this is completely unnecessary.

331
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:20,204
Well, I don't understand.

332
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:21,955
Did you agree with them?

333
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:23,928
The dancers could be farther apart,

334
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:26,042
but you were very persuasive.

335
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:29,661
You don't have to agree with them.
In fact, you're not supposed to.

336
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:32,369
You asked me to do this
based on my expertise.

337
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:34,869
Well, I'm not really
on the committee.

338
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:36,428
I'm more of a liaison.

339
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:39,119
You're supposed to tell them
that they should trust me.

340
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,975
That's your job.
They'll listen to you.

341
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:43,888
You're right.

342
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,438
I'm sorry this is so much work.

343
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,696
No, I can turn it around.

344
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,402
- And the copy machine?
- Yes, I cleared it.

345
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:55,304
I'm sorry, Father.
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

346
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:56,492
I'm very tired.

347
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,762
We'll both be prepared next time.

348
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,184
Good night, Peggy.
I really am glad you're here.

349
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:08,304
Me, too.

350
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,554
You didn't set the table?

351
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:24,601
I'm sorry. You came back so fast.

352
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:26,364
I'll get plates.

353
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:31,369
You're not going to believe
what happens on As the World Turns.

354
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,444
- You're right about that.
- Let me ask you something.

355
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:36,949
Is it possible for someone
to come out of a coma

356
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,354
and have no recollection
of who they are?

357
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:41,827
Honestly, people don't
come out of comas much.

358
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,493
Really? So it's also
probably ridiculous

359
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:47,080
they would have an accent
they didn't have beforehand?

360
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes.

361
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,623
It must have happened
to somebody.

362
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,420
They wouldn't make it up
completely, right?

363
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:54,089
Probably once. Makes a good story.

364
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,118
I'm going to get my drink.
Do you want something?

365
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:57,238
Water.

366
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,932
I didn't know
you were such a reader.

367
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,475
It's part of my job.

368
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:08,395
I thought you just walked around
with people staring at you.

369
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:10,366
You.

370
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,160
What are you bothering
with that for?

371
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,430
You should be looking for a house.

372
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,159
What happened to your
fascination with Glen Cove?

373
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,129
You told me to stop looking.

374
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:26,322
Well, I just need
to finish my training.

375
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,109
Joanie, you should be ****
not reading them

376
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:32,105
with a box of bonbons
on your lap them,

377
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,629
to soothe your cravings.

378
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,047
It's a hoot.

379
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,289
I guess that's okay.

380
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,216
I'm glad you approve.

381
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,668
We aren't you getting me
a glass of water, hon?

382
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,554
Of course.

383
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:06,219
Carla, why don't you go home?
We can do all this in the morning.

384
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,593
That jam will set.

385
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:10,345
Let me at least put
the dishes in the basin.

386
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:11,812
That's a good idea.

387
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:17,407
If you want, you can go to bed.
I'll show myself out,

388
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:18,969
call Louis to pick me up.

389
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,379
It's okay. We had a long day.

390
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,387
Thank you for all your help.

391
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,741
Good night, Mr. Draper.

392
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,435
Good night, Carla.

393
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,408
It was a great success.

394
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:50,206
You embarrassed me.

395
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,710
- What are you talking about?
- You embarrassed me.

396
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:57,462
What did I do?

397
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,132
You knew I would buy that beer.

398
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:01,884
So what?

399
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,049
Because you know me so well.

400
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:05,971
You know everything about me.

401
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,161
Bets, I use our life
all the time in my work.

402
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:10,809
They pay me for that.

403
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,622
And then you laughed.

404
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:14,262
You all laughed.

405
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,566
Must be so funny being in on it.

406
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,447
Come on.

407
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:22,779
You're taking this the wrong way.

408
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,584
You embarrassed me.

409
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:26,948
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,141
I didn't mean it.

411
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,997
You never mean it.
You just do whatever you want,

412
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,541
and I put up with it
because nobody knows.

413
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:37,955
No one is going to rember that.
You know what they're going to remember?

414
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,125
Petra Colson missing her chair.

415
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,945
Come on. Leave this. You're tired.
Let's go upstairs.

416
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,125
I'm not going to bed.

417
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:50,661
Not until you tell me why you
insist on humiliating me.

418
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,139
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

419
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,809
You're making a mountain
out of molehill.

420
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,608
I know about you and that woman.

421
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:01,692
What?

422
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:04,071
Damn it, Don, I know
you're having an affair.

423
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,509
You and Bobbie Barrett.

424
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:10,952
What?

425
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:14,164
How could you? She's so old.

426
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:16,791
Betty, that's ridiculous.

427
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,711
I'm just telling you I know.

428
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,576
Fine, Bets.

429
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,078
What do you know?

430
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,579
Go ahead. Tell me.

431
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,263
Jimmy told me everything.

432
00:24:37,254 --> 00:24:39,521
- He hates me.
- He told me everything.

433
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,191
Please. What the hell did he say?

434
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,957
So you can pick it apart?
Twist all my words?

435
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:45,813
I'm not going
to dignify Jimmy Barrett

436
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,999
with a response. He's a big mouth.

437
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:51,182
And don't pretend I don't
know how he looks at you.

438
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,224
I saw you two together.

439
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,376
You think you know me?

440
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:58,959
I know what kind of a man you are.

441
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:01,378
You think I would
sleep with that woman?

442
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,286
You can't help yourself.

443
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:06,424
Admit it.

444
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,510
There's nothing to admit.

445
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:09,811
You're lying.

446
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,489
I'm going to bed.

447
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:19,964
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Daddy.

448
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:24,127
Mommy said the party was fun.

449
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:25,845
Did she?

450
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:36,167
Bye, Daddy.

451
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:45,892
*** Daddy suit?

452
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:48,329
I've done my part.
The rest is up to her.

453
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:51,208
Don't pay attention to that due date.
It'll drive you nuts.

454
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,328
D Day.

455
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:53,521
Hello.

456
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,992
This is Mr. Pastor
and Mr. Costas from Maytag.

457
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:57,911
- Are we all better now?
- Yes.

458
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:00,507
Process seems to be streamlined.

459
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,959
Wait a minute. Is she the one
we spoke to on the phone?

460
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,836
Yes. Joan is handling
Broadcast Operations.

461
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:08,665
I had no idea.

462
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:11,768
I would have combed
my hair before called you.

463
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,384
I've got next week's scripts.

464
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,012
- Don't hold anything back now.
- She won't.

465
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,181
It was nice to meet
both of you in person.

466
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:20,329
Indeed.

467
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,979
Hell of an operation
you've got here.

468
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,243
I think so.

469
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:49,328
Gentlemen.

470
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,335
Phil. Good to see you, as always.

471
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:52,348
Francis.

472
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:54,080
Can we get you something?

473
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,208
We've got a fridge full
of Heineken out there.

474
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:58,478
No. It's 11 a.m., for Pete's sake.

475
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:01,596
Thanks for coming by.
We were just so excited,

476
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:03,895
I thought you should hear it
from the horse's mouth.

477
00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:05,565
What exactly happened?

478
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:07,954
Well...

479
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:12,084
We explained to you before
that research shows

480
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:14,021
that with the rise in commuters

481
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:16,174
and the relative scarcity
of suburban bars,

482
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:18,333
people are drinking more
in the home.

483
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:19,803
Yes, we heard you.

484
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:22,229
Entertaining housewives, et cetera.

485
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,951
We're not against it.

486
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:27,117
We just think our money would
be spent better elsewhere.

487
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,647
And honestly, I agree with you,

488
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,397
but, well, we ran a little test,

489
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:34,967
and the results were
very enlightening.

490
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:36,831
Don?

491
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,664
We targeted a few
wealthy suburban markets

492
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,700
with woman-friendly
end-aisle displays.

493
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,085
- Was there a spike?
- The sample was very small,

494
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,333
but what we put out sold well.

495
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,914
More important was who it sold to.

496
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,400
This is an untapped market

497
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,630
where you dictate the competition.

498
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,505
I think I can say this
because Don's being modest.

499
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,084
Don's wife,
she's a peach of a girl.

500
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,334
They had a dinner party.

501
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:05,765
We're talking days after placement,
and she had

502
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:09,352
this elaborate, elegant setup...
foods from around the globe.

503
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,563
And sure enough,
there was your Heineken,

504
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,982
right next to the bone china
and the polished Sterling.

505
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:17,421
- It was incredible.
- Not exactly scientific.

506
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,864
Although it sounds like
you do know your wife.

507
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:22,731
She's exactly who we're after...

508
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:25,594
well-off, educated,
with plenty of time to shop.

509
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,462
And it's important for her

510
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:30,410
that she's the perfect hostess,
the perfect wife.

511
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,148
We even talked about
using her menu verbatim

512
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:34,710
in selected ladies'magazines.

513
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:35,832
Really?

514
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,006
We haven't been there yet.

515
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:40,675
No, but it's what
I've been pushing for.

516
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,011
And so I take your word on this?

517
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,456
Why would I lie?

518
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,356
We're the ones who are
going to have to deliver.

519
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:51,707
I guess we can throw it in the mix.

520
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,195
Let's start regional.

521
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:57,233
See how some strangers'wives feel.

522
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:02,837
I would recommend buying
air time during Love of Life.

523
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:04,649
Women watching TV during the day

524
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,993
like to fantasize about
having active lifestyles.

525
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,477
They like where they could
be going with Sea & Ski.

526
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,080
And they watch every day.

527
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:14,776
I know my daughter missed a lot of
classes in college for her stories.

528
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,544
My wife brought the TV home.

529
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:17,649
There you go.

530
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:20,836
Mr. Hansen, I don't know how
Mr. Crane feels about this,

531
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:24,406
but I've been reading the scripts,
and I just have to say

532
00:31:24,526 --> 00:31:26,887
As the World Turns is
about to become unmissable.

533
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,482
I don't want to give it away,
but someone people think is dead

534
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:31,809
is not.

535
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,855
I'm glad you like it, but they all do
the same things, don't they?

536
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,981
No. Not at all.

537
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,339
This is what they call
a special summer storyline,

538
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,776
and I've spoken to Logan Reynolds
over at CBS,

539
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,821
and it's going to receive
a lot of promotion.

540
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:46,533
- Is it the same price?
- They're all close.

541
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,034
This sounds better.

542
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:51,595
Well, if you lock them in
at this rating, and then they exceed it,

543
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,706
there's a bang for your buck factor,
isn't there?

544
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:56,459
- I would say so.
- Then you should do that.

545
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:00,922
I think you'll be pleased.

546
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:03,653
That's why I didn't want
to do this on the phone.

547
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,218
I love what she says,

548
00:32:05,378 --> 00:32:07,508
and I love the way she says it.

549
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:09,223
Let me walk you out.

550
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:22,784
Are you okay, Mommy?

551
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,822
I'm okay, sweetheart.

552
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:31,134
I'm just not feeling very well.

553
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,897
Do you want some aspirin?

554
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,208
No, Sally.

555
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,668
I'm just going to rest
a little bit, okay?

556
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:40,771
Go play with your brother.

557
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,410
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.

558
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:22,920
You said 4:30.

559
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:24,797
Hell, is it only 4:30?

560
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,424
Sorry about that.

561
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:29,761
Listen, I'll be brief,
since it appears I'm on my way out.

562
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,013
I've received a lot
of unsolicited phone calls.

563
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:34,074
Simply put, the customers
are satisfied,

564
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:36,512
and so is the accounting department.
Keep up the good work.

565
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,353
I'm not doing it on my own.

566
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,197
That's true, isn't it?

567
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:42,690
Why don't we get those secretaries
back to their regular jobs?

568
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,400
It's just Joan Holloway, actually.

569
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:47,397
So her attentions
are divided at best.

570
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:49,370
Make it a full-time position,
150 a week,

571
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,952
and he has to share an office.

572
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,322
Sounds perfect.

573
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:11,875
Hello.

574
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,711
Where are the kids?

575
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,529
Bed.

576
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,335
What happened here?

577
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,947
Nothing.

578
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,663
Nothing happened here.

579
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:41,919
I went through every pocket
and every drawer,

580
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,168
and there's nothing.

581
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,695
Would you stop?

582
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,095
How much have you had to drink?

583
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:50,520
I don't know why
I even bother looking.

584
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:53,576
All I found were stacks
of cocktail napkins

585
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,722
with stupid advertising on them.

586
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:57,473
What are you doing, Bets?

587
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:02,959
I would never do this to you.

588
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,360
How could you do this to me?

589
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:10,684
I didn't do anything.

590
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:51,072
What time is it?

591
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,621
I don't want it to be like this.

592
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:03,885
Me, either.

593
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,411
I don't know what to do.

594
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:12,973
Don't.

595
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,424
Nothing happened.

596
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,924
Now you look me in the eye.

597
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:26,320
You never do that.

598
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:28,948
Yes, I do.

599
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,011
You never say you love me.

600
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,261
Yes, I do.

601
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,347
You know I do.

602
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,625
I say it all the time.

603
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:44,287
No, you don't.

604
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,574
Do you hate me?

605
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:54,352
God, no.

606
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:59,235
I love you, Bets.

607
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:01,075
I do.

608
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,786
And I love the children.

609
00:37:06,904 --> 00:37:08,895
I don't want to lose all this.

610
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,894
This is a very
impressive operation.

611
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:34,464
It's Madison Avenue.

612
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:37,162
Look at this.

613
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,677
Did we get Miracle Whip?

614
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,268
I don't know. Makes a lot of sense.

615
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,038
She's an undercover nun.

616
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,853
So Turk doesn't know which way
to turn, he's so drunk,

617
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,229
so finally he stops.

618
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:51,741
We get out of the car,

619
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:54,525
and the sign says "Bridge Out."

620
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:58,029
- Hello, Joan.
- You wanted to see me?

621
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:00,907
- Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.
- Dan.

622
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:04,848
He's going to be in charge
of Broadcast Operations.

623
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:06,500
Excuse me?

624
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:09,691
I really appreciated you filling in.
I couldn't have asked for more.

625
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,690
Joan knows everything about this.

626
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,377
That makes one of us.

627
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,505
I've already given him
next week's scripts.

628
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,068
It would be great if you could
fill him in on how it works.

629
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,188
Right now?

630
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,051
Why not? Are you busy?

631
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:25,784
No. Not at all.

632
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:31,975
It's really just reading scripts,
all of them,

633
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,200
and looking through the storylines
to see if there's any...

634
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,963
possible benefits to our clients,

635
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:43,881
how their products may be
portrayed to their advantage,

636
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:46,793
and, of course, getting
the cooperation of the networks.

637
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,817
That's pretty much what I said.

638
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:50,987
Not exactly.

639
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:53,125
Listen, you're going to be around

640
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:55,110
to help with the details, right?

641
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:57,939
Yes, of course.

642
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:00,256
Anything else?

643
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:02,326
No, Joan. And thank you again.

644
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:14,655
This is wonderful.
It's completely automatic.

645
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,627
I just leave it.

646
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,487
If you set the number.

647
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:23,328
You know, don't think we don't know

648
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,712
how lucky we are having
you do this for us.

649
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:28,335
Thank you. It's nice
to be included.

650
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:38,796
Peggy, do you have something
you need to talk about?

651
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:40,715
Excuse me?

652
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,021
I've noticed that you
don't take Communion.

653
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:45,071
And I don't think
it's too much of a leap

654
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:48,188
to ask if there's something
you need to talk about.

655
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,017
No.

656
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:53,801
God already knows
whatever it is, Peggy.

657
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:57,023
Well, then I don't need to talk.

658
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,626
Well, I'm here right now.

659
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,647
Father, don't take this
the wrong way,

660
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:08,627
but I don't think you'd understand.

661
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:13,914
God is bigger than what
we were raised on.

662
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,351
Father, you don't have to live life
like the rest of us.

663
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,297
Maybe you're lucky.

664
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:22,952
I've lived life.

665
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:24,870
I wasn't born a priest.

666
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,416
Of course not.

667
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,940
You know, when you distance
yourself from the church,

668
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,809
you are distancing
yourself from everything.

669
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,767
That's why it's called
Communion, you know.

670
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:38,481
It's not just being with God.

671
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,666
It's being with people.

672
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:41,879
I know that.

673
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,280
Well, then, why are you
pushing everyone away?

674
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,018
I'm not.

675
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:53,268
There is no sin too great
to bring to God.

676
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,794
You can reconcile yourself with Him

677
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:58,790
and have a whole new start.

678
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:03,547
You're a smart, beautiful young girl.
You have so much to offer.

679
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:10,476
Do you feel you don't
deserve His love?

680
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:23,484
Your copies are done.

681
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:27,732
I'll put them in a box for you.

682
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:40,896
There you go.

683
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:44,130
Thank you very much, Peggy.
I'll see you on Sunday?

684
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:45,923
Yes, of course.

685
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:26,301
<i>Imagine my horror when a night
on the town turned ugly.</i>

686
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:29,454
<i>This is a nice place for nice people,
And the jerk behind the bar,</i>

687
00:42:29,574 --> 00:42:31,426
<i>he throws a bowl of nuts at me.</i>

688
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:33,096
<i>What am I, a squirrel?</i>

689
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:37,413
<i>Lucky for him,
I carry my own wherever I go.</i>

690
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:40,304
<i>Am I crazy? I don't think so.</i>

691
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:43,919
<i>Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.</i>

692
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,054
<i>Take it from a nut.
Utz are better than nuts.</i>

693
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:56,576
We have chains in almost
every suburban market

694
00:42:56,738 --> 00:42:59,330
on the East Coast,
plus Chicago, Cleveland.

695
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,040
It's a vote of confidence.

696
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,542
<i>Mrs. Draper is on the line.</i>

00:43:04,774 --> 00:43:06,128
I got to take this.

698
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:07,671
Thank her again for me.

00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:15,845
Hello.

700
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,907
Don't come home.

701
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:19,286
What?

702
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:22,895
I don't care what you do.
I just don't want you here.

703
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:28,882
I don't want to see you.
