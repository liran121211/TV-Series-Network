00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:03,817
Mad Men 2x5
<i>The New Girl</i>

2
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,269
Mr. And Mrs. Campbell.

3
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,045
I'm Dr. Stone.

4
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,287
And how are we today?

5
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:30,163
We're so pleased to be here.
My friend, Sara Driscoll,

6
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,932
her father is head of Obstetrics
at Lenox Hill.

7
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,472
- She said you get results.
- They got results.

8
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:38,517
Sometimes all a young couple needs
is a good old-fashioned hand-holding.

9
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,159
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.

10
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:43,113
Now,

11
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:47,040
I am going to ask you
some questions together

12
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,703
and more intimate ones separately.

14
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,698
How long have you
been trying to conceive?

15
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:54,865
18 months.

16
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,911
That sounds like
a long time. Is it?

17
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,666
Let's not worry about what's normal.
Everyone is different.

18
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,717
Are you two aware of
the principles of conception?

19
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,690
Of how the sperm meets the egg?

20
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,615
Yes.

21
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:13,261
Although, if you'd like
to show us some films...

22
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,260
You'd be surprised.

23
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:19,001
Prior to the decision to conceive,
were you using birth control?

24
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,816
- She was.
- I used a diaphragm.

25
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:23,061
Although, it's possible
I didn't need to.

26
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:24,656
Mrs. Campbell.

27
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,193
So we're walking
in the park after lunch,

28
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:31,837
and he sees these birds

29
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:33,770
picking seeds
out of some horse shit,

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,623
and he says, "Move over, fellows.
That's my job."

31
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,956
That sounds like a visit
from the stork or De Beers.

32
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,166
Or it could be just a new hairdo.

33
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,415
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.

34
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,892
How are you this morning?

35
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,606
- Joan.
- Good morning.

36
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,177
Well, there's your answer.

37
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:56,760
- Ever had mumps?
- Yes.

38
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,594
- How old were you?
- Summer of'45.

39
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,847
11, 12.

40
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,312
Did your testicles descend normally?

41
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:07,201
Absolutely.

42
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,776
And have you ever fathered a child?

43
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,069
No.

44
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,948
Have you ever had difficulty
completing the sexual act?

45
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,639
Drinking doesn't help.

46
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,956
But no. I always reach home base.

47
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:25,332
Do you have difficulties
with arousal?

48
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,187
Jesus.

49
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,962
I'm a red-blooded
American male, okay?

50
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,226
No one is questioning
your manhood, Mr. Campbell.

51
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,943
You could be a warrior,

52
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,631
an athlete, a bull of a man.

53
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,065
George Washington was sterile.

54
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,182
Fertility has nothing
to do with manliness.

55
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:46,604
Do you want to have a child?

56
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:48,951
What kind of question is that?

57
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:50,987
Course I do.

58
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,825
What man doesn't want a child?

59
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,824
Although you think about
the world right now.

60
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,442
The bomb.

61
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,417
- Do you worry about the world?
- Occasionally.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,540
Do you work with X-rays,
radioactive material,

63
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,256
or toxic chemicals?

64
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,826
I'm in advertising.

65
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,478
We got a Xerox machine,
but I don't use it.

66
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,681
Not personally.

67
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,642
Advertising, huh?
Must be a lot of fun.

68
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:26,438
Are you kidding?

69
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,008
I'm an account man.

70
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:31,378
I spend half my day tiptoeing
around creative crybabies

71
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:34,068
and the other half drinking
with ungrateful turnips

72
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:36,038
who just fell off the truck.

73
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,479
I'm completely replaceable,

74
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,283
even though I just
brought in a huge account.

75
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:44,188
Then...

76
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:47,007
you throw this baby thing
on top of it,

77
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,477
the economy contracting,
my in-laws.

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,211
Yes. Yes, it's a lot.

79
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:56,664
- What about your parents?
- My father just passed away.

80
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,111
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,888
Do you think that has
something to do with this?

82
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,444
It doesn't.

83
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,564
I mean...

84
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,541
I try not to think about it.

85
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,570
It's been a few months.

86
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,810
It is a difficult moment
in the life cycle.

87
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,776
But we are part of
a continuum, aren't we?

88
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,091
So maybe I'm the end of the line.

89
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,714
That'll do it, Mr. Campbell.

90
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:31,197
- I think I feel better already.
- Can you send in your wife?

91
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:33,749
And then I'd like you to
schedule a time with a nurse

92
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,354
for a semen analysis.

93
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,715
Whenever she's free.

94
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,009
Red and green are my colors,
so we're gonna do Christmas.

95
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,879
He doesn't know that yet.

96
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,758
I can cover
Mr. Draper's desk for you.

97
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:50,384
- I know you'll have your hands full.
- You had your shot.

98
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:51,571
It's beautiful.

99
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,500
Miss Holloway,
those aren't wedding bells.

100
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,262
I'm so sorry, Mr. Draper.

101
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,139
Mr. Draper's office.

102
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,204
One moment, please.

103
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:05,290
Mr. Draper,
Bobbi Barrett on line 1.

104
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:06,568
Thank you.

105
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:13,543
Bobbi.

106
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,605
Don, I want you
to ask me how I am.

107
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,798
How are you?

108
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,718
Where are you right now?

109
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:23,728
I'm in my office,

110
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,708
where you called me.

111
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:29,317
- You sound a little tipsy.
- We did it.

112
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,310
We sold Grin and Barrett.

113
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,770
Congratulations. You got an order?

114
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,698
No, but we're going
to make a pilot.

115
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,759
I remember that because Jimmy said,

116
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,777
"Ask her. She's made
every pilot in town."

117
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:43,321
<i>Come celebrate with me.</i>

118
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,073
I'm at Sardi's,
surrounded by clowns.

119
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,243
And why would I come?

120
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,541
I'm being ignored.
Come take up my time.

121
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,428
I'm working.

122
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,504
<i>You provided key advice.</i>

123
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,256
We can call it business.

124
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,426
No. Let's not confuse this.

125
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,916
I'm about to change my mind.

126
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:21,882
Thank you.

127
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,780
Was there even a party?

128
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,230
He'll have an Old Fashioned.

129
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,447
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy

130
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,389
that Gleason didn't have
to make a pilot,

131
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,209
so Jimmy went home to sulk,

132
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,011
and the rest went out to celebrate
that they ruined his day.

133
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,381
So here we are.

134
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,071
I expect him to get this way
when it's bad,

135
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,641
but when it's good?

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,324
Maybe he doesn't understand
how big this is.

137
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:50,494
No, he does.

138
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:53,445
It's the big opportunity
he's bound to ruin.

139
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,698
- Mr. Draper.
- Miss Menken.

140
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,742
Actually, it's Mrs. Katz.

141
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,953
- This is my husband Tilden.
- Pleasure.

142
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:17,430
Mr. Draper's firm did some work
for us a while back.

143
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,639
Advertising.

144
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,205
- I'm Bobbi Barrett.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,303
Mrs. Barrett's husband
is a comedian who works with me.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,765
- Nice to meet you.
- Tilden. I love comedians.

147
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,683
So how are things at Grey?

148
00:08:36,803 --> 00:08:39,187
Are they still taking credit
for everything we did?

149
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:41,157
He's all business, isn't he?

150
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:44,252
Now, Rach, we don't
want to miss the curtain.

151
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:46,125
We have seats for
A Funny Thing Happened.

152
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,695
It's wonderful.

153
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,033
- You two enjoy working together.
- Nice to meet you.

154
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:05,298
So, I would like
some really good chow.

155
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,493
- Shall we go else where?
- We can.

156
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,553
Does feel a little cloudy
in here right now.

157
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,055
No, it's fine.

158
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,560
So, tell me what I want.

159
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:19,812
Steak tartare.

160
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,874
Oh, my God, you're good.

161
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,445
Hearts of palm salad.
Steak tartare.

162
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,782
I always order for Jimmy.
Watch the money.

163
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:35,000
Otherwise he ends up sporting
for people we don't know.

164
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,039
He doesn't realize that being a big shot
means you don't have to pay.

165
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,046
I think you're wrong about that.

166
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,420
In the end, we're in
different businesses, okay?

167
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,926
To a nice price on the pilot.

168
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,998
And I boxed them in for 39
on the air if they order.

169
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,850
You should have seen my neckline.

170
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:01,228
You really do his business,
don't you?

171
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:04,750
If it wasn't for me,
it wouldn't be Grin and Barrett.

172
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,720
It'd be Grin and Brownstein.

173
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,932
This is America.

174
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:12,113
Pick a job and then become
the person that does it.

175
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,034
Well, that's true.

176
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,271
Right after I met Jimmy,

177
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,734
I watched...

178
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,933
somebody's Uncle Morty
close a deal for him,

179
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,836
and I realized
I negotiate for everything.

180
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,875
The rent, the plumber,
my hairdresser.

181
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,545
I even did it
in a department store once.

182
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,562
It's touchy because you're
really telling somebody

183
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:38,014
they're not worth what they think.
But you can't hurt their feelings.

184
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,045
Negotiating is a bore.

185
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,932
It's hand-to-hand combat.

186
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,484
You don't like negotiating.
What the hell do you like?

187
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,318
What do you mean?

188
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:53,632
Doesn't have to be in business.
I'll take anything.

189
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,412
You can't even answer.

190
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,039
The answer is huge.

191
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,219
I don't think so.

192
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,298
Do you like the ocean?

193
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:10,701
Yes.

194
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:12,913
Yes, I do.

195
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,008
I have a little place in Stony Brook,
right on the shore.

196
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,234
I want to have you on the beach.

197
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,820
Feel the cold sand on my back.

198
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,595
The surf pounding behind us.

199
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,671
I can smell the ocean.

200
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:53,432
I love bridges.

201
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:57,573
I don't know if it's the drop

202
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:01,100
or just 'cause you get to see
something disappearing behind you.

203
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:03,758
Do you like bridges?

204
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:05,958
I do.

205
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,558
That's two things you like.
What else?

206
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,108
Movies.

207
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:19,149
Yes. Spartacus?

208
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,858
You seen the foreign ones?
So sexy.

209
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,623
La Notte.

210
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,121
Yes.

211
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,073
Why is it so hard
to just enjoy things?

212
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,572
God, I feel so good.

213
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:47,922
I don't feel a thing.

214
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,259
You all right?

215
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:35,490
I think so.

216
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:40,948
Are you okay in there?

217
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:59,452
Mr. Draper, your wife says
that the whiskey was hers.

218
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,240
But you did fail the sobriety test.

219
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,388
You're at the legal limit.

220
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,779
0.15 percent.

221
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,020
The fine's $150.

222
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,609
May I?

223
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,998
There's $63 and some subway tokens.

224
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,044
I'll mail you the rest.

225
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,574
I need you to pay the fine tonight.
Or I can put you up.

226
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,122
Let me call a cab,
and I'll send an employee

227
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,095
out here with the $500
tomorrow morning.

228
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,291
I bet you would, too.

229
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:50,564
Nah, it's just 150.

230
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,062
It's within my rights
to detain you.

231
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:56,259
What is the problem?

232
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,793
People's kids are out
on that road, sir.

233
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,080
Call somebody.

234
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,102
Or maybe your wife has a friend.

235
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:46,660
I have $110.

236
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,327
It's all I could get short notice.

237
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:11,329
If you're going to be sick,
please tell me.

238
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,684
This is my brother-in-law's car.

239
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,561
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.

240
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,928
I don't want to have
to clean it, too.

241
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,873
Mr. Draper, I think
you should keep her awake.

242
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,243
Bobbi, stay up!

243
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,053
What?

244
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,031
What do you think?

245
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,809
- Are you feeling okay?
- You can drop me off at Grand Central.

246
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,221
- Bobbi, what do you want to do?
- Jimmy can't see me this way.

247
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:50,346
I should check in somewhere,
see how the shiner does.

248
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,882
Peggy, do you have a roommate?

249
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,852
- No.
- I don't know.

250
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,280
No, you should stay with me.

251
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:02,104
Just for the night, if you want.

252
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:06,862
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.
I can take you to LaGuardia.

253
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,186
Idlewild is better.
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.

254
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:14,256
It's faster to take
the Grand Central to LaGuardia.

255
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:22,002
I don't have any clothes.
I wish I was your size.

256
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:26,187
Do you have any dry cleaning?
I'll pick it up.

257
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:29,550
- In the city.
- I'll go in and get it first thing.

258
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,476
Okay?

259
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:35,149
Hello.

260
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:37,897
Leave her alone.

261
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:44,511
No one in the office
can know about this.

262
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,799
It's business.

263
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,725
You'll have to believe me
that I'll forget this.

264
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:58,330
I don't want you treating me badly
because I remind you of it.

265
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,248
This can be fixed.

266
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,418
- Where the hell were you?
- I was in an accident.

267
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:47,148
What?

268
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,507
Are you okay? What happened?

269
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,238
By the time I could call,
I didn't want to wake you.

270
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:58,651
Wake... Wake me?
I've been awake all night.

271
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:02,509
I knew something was wrong.
I could feel it.

272
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,393
I went to the doctor a while ago.

273
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,440
And I have high blood pressure.

274
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,396
- What the hell, Don?
- It's fine, except...

275
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,139
he gave me a prescription,

276
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,066
and I think the pills
mixed with the drinks

277
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,451
was too much.

278
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,633
I lost control of the car.

279
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:20,703
Jesus.

280
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,888
How could you
not tell me about this?

281
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,858
I didn't want to worry you.

282
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,907
I've been up all night.

283
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:32,883
And... And now I find out you're sick
and you could have died?

284
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:36,613
What did you want me to do?
Have you come down there?

285
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,992
Ask Francine in the middle
of the night to watch the kids

286
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,887
because your husband's
in the drunk tank?

287
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,908
Who cares if I couldn't help you?

288
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:45,396
You should call me.

289
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,954
I'm your wife.

290
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,583
I was solving the problem, Bets.
I need a clear head.

291
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,485
You can't get all hysterical.

292
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:57,535
I didn't know you were waiting up.

293
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,496
You promised you wouldn't
disappear like that anymore.

294
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,879
I have to get changed and go in.

295
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,328
You're going to the office?

296
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:15,898
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

297
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,331
I rented a car.
I'll have to get my car.

298
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,501
I don't care about the car, Don.

299
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,391
My father has high blood pressure.

300
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,038
I'll swing by Dr. McGlavery
on the way in.

301
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:33,025
Just help me get dressed, okay?

302
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:46,623
You can fend without me.

303
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:50,548
I'm at a fat farm.

304
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,672
One of your friends
made a crack about my ass.

305
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:56,560
It doesn't matter who.

306
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:07,022
We're gonna be all over the television,
and the camera adds 10 pounds.

307
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,736
No. You look fine.

308
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:13,692
Jimmy, stop.

309
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:17,947
You and I both know you should have
behaved yourself last night.

310
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:20,560
I will.

311
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:27,539
I couldn't find an ashtray.

312
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:34,204
- What's all this?
- I thought you might be hungry.

313
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:35,706
It'll ruin my alibi.

314
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,176
I need cottage cheese
and champagne.

315
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,448
I'm joking.

316
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,516
Do you mind if I lay down
for a few minutes?

317
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,683
- I'm not used to being up all night.
- Of course, dear.

318
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:49,098
And I got these to keep me company.

319
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:51,892
I'll make up the couch for you.
You must be beat, too.

320
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:53,625
I'll make it. Where are the linens?

321
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,066
Just a minute.

322
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:00,997
Oh, Marilyn.

323
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,188
The tragedy you live.

324
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,798
I'm sure glad
I don't have problems.

325
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,251
I think most women would
love to have her problems.

326
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:14,019
Somebody said she's gonna
be at the fundraiser

327
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,998
at the Garden on Saturday night.

328
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,700
You know, the President's birthday?

329
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:22,636
- I really don't want to miss it.
- Do you have a headache?

330
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:25,368
Because we had a little boy
in our neighborhood

331
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,247
who fell off a swing set
and hit his head

332
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,767
and went to sleep.
And then he died.

333
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:33,187
It's certainly
good to have company.

334
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,050
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't talk that way.

335
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:40,686
I keep forgetting the accident.

336
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:42,954
It was terrible.

337
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,650
And it keeps getting stranger.

338
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:49,325
If you're lucky, it will disappear.

339
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:51,338
I have to lie down.

340
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:54,063
Are you his secretary?

341
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,450
No. But we work together.

342
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:00,829
We'll both be handling
Mr. Draper for the time being.

343
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,260
Now, you're a college girl,

344
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,393
so I'm going to expect you
to jump in with haste.

345
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,332
I have a lot of arrangements
to make for my wedding.

346
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,394
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.

347
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,123
He's a doctor.
He doesn't work here,

348
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:13,090
so don't worry about putting
your foot in your mouth.

349
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,069
Lucky you. Let me see?

350
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,482
Oh, it's so lively.

351
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:21,527
You'd like to think
it doesn't matter.

352
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:26,282
I've been offered a few,
and this is by far the best.

353
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,368
I'm a little bit clairvoyant,

354
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:35,537
and I think you two are going
to be very happy together.

355
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,340
I feel like I'm walking
in tall cotton.

356
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:46,755
Aren't you darling?
You're gonna be gangbusters.

357
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:50,765
Mr. Draper is impatient.
Do not let it intimidate you.

358
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,061
If it isn't the welcome wagon.

359
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:58,932
Hello there.
I'm Ken Cosgrove, accounts.

360
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:00,805
Paul Kinsey, copywriter.

361
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:02,736
Harry Crane, married.

362
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:04,738
Jane Segal.

363
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,872
Anything I can help
you gentlemen with?

364
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,049
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.

365
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,431
Is he in?

366
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:15,248
- Morning, Don.
- Good morning.

367
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,086
Mr. Draper. I'd like you
to meet Jane, the new girl.

368
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:21,687
Good morning.

369
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:25,587
Can I talk to you for a minute?

370
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:29,978
I'm gonna help you
hold on to this one.

371
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:33,266
I'm not paying attention anymore
until they're here a month.

372
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,560
What happened to your wing?

373
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,976
I missed the bottom step.

374
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:41,483
It's an old house.

375
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,267
I got an urgent call
from Jimmy Barrett.

376
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:46,279
- He wants to come in.
- Why?

377
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,226
He wouldn't say.

378
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,951
- Is he upset about something?
- Who can tell?

379
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,175
I want you to put him off
a few days, let him cool.

380
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:00,961
He'll make more sense.

381
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,041
Good idea.
He probably wants a rubdown.

382
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:04,915
Paper says they ordered his pilot.

383
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,035
Friday.

384
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,720
- Should I talk to your girl?
- I'll handle it.

385
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,349
You bet.

386
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,565
Get the door.

387
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:29,948
- Hello?
- Is everything okay?

388
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,824
Yes, I think so.

389
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,286
- Is she awake?
- She's fine.

390
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,380
- Put her on.
- Just a minute.

391
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,427
I didn't think you'd call.

392
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,636
- Why not?
- <i>I don't know. I just...</i>

393
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,089
How are you?

394
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:55,875
I don't know.

395
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:57,893
Jimmy called.
He wants to meet with me.

396
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,287
He does?

397
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,229
I called him,
and everything went fine.

398
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,044
So you don't know
anything about this?

399
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:06,381
<i>You think I'd be in Brooklyn
if I didn't have to be?</i>

400
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:08,402
I talked to him.
I'm covered. Believe me.

401
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:09,788
I do.

402
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:12,752
Are you okay?

403
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:14,976
I guess.

404
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:16,788
You?

405
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:19,413
It's going to be better.

406
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,911
Good.

407
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,041
Take care.

408
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,769
Do you want to play cards
or something?

409
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,891
- I think I have some.
- No.

410
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,152
I'm sorry, but it's killing me.

411
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,698
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't know. He's my boss.

412
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:57,366
Quite an example he's setting.

413
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:01,991
Are you seeing him?

414
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,588
No.

415
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:05,752
So what, then?

416
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,128
He's done a lot for me.

417
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,357
He made me a copywriter.

418
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,827
I bet you made yourself
a copywriter.

419
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,226
All these books.

420
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:19,975
He's a decent man, isn't he?
You wouldn't think he would be.

421
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:23,601
I never expect him to be
any other way than what he is.

422
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,420
We'll keep her here
for another few weeks.

423
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,442
She's still not in any condition
to make decisions for herself.

424
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:41,998
She should be at home.

425
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,968
Listen to the doctor, Mama.

426
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,001
In this kind of
psychoneurotic disorder...

427
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,121
Hello, Ma.

428
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:50,504
Hello, dear.

429
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,796
I'm afraid you'll have
to leave us alone.

430
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:59,859
I'm going, but I'm
not leaving, Peaches.

431
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,605
Hello, Peggy.

432
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:14,799
How are you today?

433
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,115
I just still feel so tired.

434
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,300
Do you know what year it is?

435
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,163
It's 1960.

436
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,895
Do you know who the President is?

437
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:29,711
- Dwight D. Eisenhower.
- Good.

438
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:33,250
Do you know where you are, Peggy?

439
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,325
St. Mary's.

440
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:38,300
Do you know why you're here?

441
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:41,749
No.

442
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,099
You know St. Mary's is a hospital?

443
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,602
Yes.

444
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,104
Why do you think you're here?

445
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:52,662
I don't know.

446
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,113
I don't feel like myself.

447
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:00,906
That's because we have you
on medication.

448
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:03,828
We want you to be relaxed
so you feel more like talking.

449
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,764
I told you what happened.

450
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:12,887
You had a baby.

451
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,958
You know, you can
hear that outside.

452
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:10,730
Nobody knows what I'm doing.
It's good for mystique.

453
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,067
So, Joanie, I hear
congratulations are in order.

454
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:17,642
Yes.

455
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,696
Marriage. Don't know why you'd
want to join that club, baby.

456
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,396
Hasn't stopped you
from having a good time.

457
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:26,143
- How old is this guy?
- He's 34.

458
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:30,016
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

459
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:33,702
I think it's nice to hear the story
of relatively young love.

460
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:36,314
Are you being a concerned daddy?

461
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,708
I'll tell you the same thing
I told my daughter.

462
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,678
If you put a penny in a jar

463
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:45,539
every time you make love
in the first year of marriage,

464
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,345
and then you take
a penny out of the jar

465
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:49,315
every time you make love
in the second year,

466
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:51,686
you know what you have?
A jar full of pennies.

467
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,438
I envy that girl having you
to give her away.

468
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:59,966
I've always been faithful
to whomever I was with.

469
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,291
And despite your jokes,

470
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,967
I always assumed you
were unhappy with Mona,

471
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,409
not the whole idea.

472
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,620
You aren't just
another woman, Joanie.

473
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:12,615
Well, it doesn't
matter now, does it?

474
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,330
I fell in love.

475
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:17,978
Makes me sad.

476
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:20,881
Just another reason
not to come in to work.

477
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,104
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yes, you are.

478
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:25,643
You'll see.

479
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:31,368
Can I give you
a couple paddles for good luck?

480
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:47,454
Coffee.

481
00:31:48,904 --> 00:31:50,668
Thanks for buying milk.

482
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,230
I live alone. It always goes bad.

483
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:56,855
So this really must be
a kick in the head.

484
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:58,768
Company is nice.

485
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:00,774
Your eye's improved.

486
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:02,144
Oh, that's good.

487
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:04,585
I can cover the purple
with some green eye shadow.

488
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,718
Complementary colors. We use that.

489
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,269
Old trick.

490
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:09,899
I was a dancer.

491
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,559
I met a lot of interesting people.

492
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,854
- You have a boyfriend?
- No, I don't.

493
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,402
So, are you in love with him?

494
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:23,946
No.

495
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,381
It's not a ridiculous question.

496
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:28,769
Are you?

497
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:32,620
It's a personal question,
and I've already answered you.

498
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:35,790
You're right.

499
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:44,423
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm in love with him?

500
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:46,342
It's none of my business.

501
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,468
You're right again.

502
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,057
You're so young and beautiful.

503
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:56,226
I'm not your competion.

504
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,794
That's sweet.

505
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,010
Is there anything else
I can get you?

506
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,930
No.

507
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,980
I love your place.

508
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:12,138
- I've been trying to fix it up.
- Well, I like it.

509
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:13,725
It takes me back.

510
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:31,134
Unless one of you needs help
finding a dead client file,

511
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:33,804
I suggest you pitch
your tents elsewhere.

512
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,648
I see what you're doing, and
I have to say I'm disappointed.

513
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:43,698
I don't follow.

514
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,809
Your décolletage is distracting.

515
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:48,445
This is an office that hinges
on professional decorum.

516
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:50,892
I'm so sorry, Joan.

517
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,980
I didn't realize.

518
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,912
- Better?
- Go out and get a sweater at lunch.

519
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,373
Be reasonable.

520
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:01,751
There's still plenty to see,
and you know that.

521
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:08,944
Jane.

522
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:12,255
I have some very important talent

523
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:14,581
coming in tomorrow to see Don,

524
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,139
somebody famous,

525
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:19,184
and I just want to make sure
you're aware of that.

526
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:21,854
What's your title here?

527
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:23,216
Title?

528
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm Ken.

529
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:28,154
Cosgrove.

530
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:30,780
Accounts.

531
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,324
Yes, you're here in the book
with Jimmy Barrett.

532
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:36,459
Would you like
to go see him sometime?

533
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:38,573
Hey. Listen to this.

534
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:53,579
It's Mozart.

535
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:13,035
You can use the mirror
in the bedroom.

536
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,155
No.

537
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:18,599
Part of the process of learning
to live without your hospitality.

538
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,869
It's nothing.

539
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:23,341
Not true.

540
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,222
I was curious if you're aware

541
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,285
of the value of your service.

542
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:40,055
It's what you're supposed
to do, isn't it?

543
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,526
Wouldn't say that. People will
take advantage of you.

544
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:45,021
I know what I'm doing.

545
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:50,068
What do you want?

546
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:54,905
Are you just some busy little bee
building a hive out in Brooklyn?

547
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,356
Are you still trying
to say thank you?

548
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:02,713
You have to start living the life
of the person you want to be.

549
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,519
Is that what you did?

550
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:12,732
You're never going
to get that corner office

551
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,758
until you start
treating Don as an equal.

552
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,095
And no one will tell you this,

553
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,406
but you can't be a man.
Don't even try.

554
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:23,845
Be a woman.

555
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,939
It's powerful business
when done correctly.

556
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:36,446
Do you understand
what I'm saying, dear?

557
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,133
I think so.

558
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,081
So, how do I get
to Grand Central from here,

559
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:47,201
steam ship?

560
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:50,628
I can walk you to the train.
It's two blocks over.

561
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:52,263
I'll call a car.

562
00:36:58,328 --> 00:36:59,328
Hello?

563
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,563
- How was your day?
- Spectacular.

564
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:10,527
Duck called Bert Peterson
a mongoloid.

565
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:14,235
- What a leader of men.
- Dr. Stone's office rang.

566
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,570
How is Dr. Stone?

567
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:19,522
I didn't ask, but the nurse said

568
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,792
that your sample was quite viable.

569
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:23,790
Is that right?

570
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,789
What do you know?

571
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:31,315
That is a relief,

572
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:33,264
I do say.

573
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:35,047
Yes.

574
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:39,718
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound, are they?

575
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,139
I suppose.

576
00:37:45,454 --> 00:37:46,604
To viability.

577
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,648
What? This is good.

578
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,187
It is.

579
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:56,610
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

580
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,406
No, you're right. It's a relief.
Now we know it's me.

581
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:01,632
Right.

582
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:03,902
So Stone can blow up your ovaries

583
00:38:04,022 --> 00:38:06,069
or do whatever
his cutting-edge plan is.

584
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:08,497
Peter, I can't believe you.

585
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:11,444
Wait a minute.
You wanted to do this.

586
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:13,627
You had to know this was
a possible outcome.

587
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:15,965
Get back here!

588
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:17,313
Trudy!

589
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:23,753
Sit down.

590
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:27,815
I'm sorry.

591
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,627
I didn't think it through.

592
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,026
That's honest.

593
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:37,351
I don't know what I thought.

594
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:40,633
Who says we have to do this?

595
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,031
Except for what,

596
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:44,134
it's the next thing we're
supposed to do?

597
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:45,617
But it is. It's natural.

598
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:46,876
Says who?

599
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:50,939
I was having a great time.

600
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:53,365
Weren't you?

601
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,650
Maybe this is the way
it's supposed to be.

602
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,716
I mean, you have a baby.

603
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,381
You can't travel.

604
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:04,258
You can't go to the movies
unless you have help,

605
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,928
and that's expensive.

606
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,556
You're immature, Peter,
you know that?

607
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,944
I just did a very private thing

608
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:12,883
in a very public place for you.

609
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:15,653
And guess what?
You don't like the results.

610
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:19,129
What do you want me to do?

611
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:21,303
Express some concern.

612
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:24,010
And stop talking about
how you're going to miss

613
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,197
seeing Cape Fear for
the third time.

614
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:28,694
I know one thing. I sure as hell
wouldn't want a kid here

615
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:30,564
watching this donny brook.

616
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:32,822
Either you make it
through this thing,

617
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,881
or you just keep it to yourself.

618
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,500
I'm giving you that option.

619
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,420
Stop!

620
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:42,316
I'm sorry.

621
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:44,564
I'm just...

622
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:50,077
It's just I really do

623
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,149
want a baby.

624
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,365
What is all this for?

625
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:06,592
I don't know.

626
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:13,628
Can we eat now?

627
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,254
Not here.

628
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:19,653
Get your coat.

629
00:40:56,004 --> 00:40:57,054
Is that you?

630
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:00,878
Are you really there?

631
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:02,818
Yes I am.

632
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:06,906
What are you doing here?

633
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:10,854
You got a promotion
and disappeared.

634
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:15,100
Your Christmas present
is sitting on your desk.

635
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:17,762
I called your house,

636
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:20,105
and your roommate gave me
your mother's number.

637
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:21,942
Oh, God.

638
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,430
Your mother told me
you were quarantined.

639
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,056
TB.

640
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,983
I guess that was supposed
to lessen my concern.

641
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:38,748
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,543
What's wrong with you?

643
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:43,592
I don't know.

644
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:46,757
What do they want you to do?

645
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:50,905
I don't know.

646
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:53,368
Yes, you do.

647
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:57,366
Do it.

648
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:00,727
Do whatever they say.

649
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,200
Peggy, listen to me.

650
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:11,923
Get out of here

651
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,576
and move forward.

652
00:42:16,688 --> 00:42:18,138
This never happened.

653
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:24,552
It will shock you
how much it never happened.

654
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,559
It's old work, and we're
meeting early next week.

655
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:40,377
The artwork is new.

656
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:42,867
I'm going to see my
father-in-law this weekend,

657
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,737
and he's going to ask me.

658
00:42:46,512 --> 00:42:49,362
<i>Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrett
is going to be early.</i>

659
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:53,966
I'm sorry I'm late.

660
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:57,106
Don was asking where
we're going with this.

661
00:42:57,706 --> 00:42:59,872
I need more time. I was sick.

662
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:01,979
I did my work.

663
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:07,021
Shall we bring someone else in?
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?

664
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:09,712
I don't know. Miss Olsen,
do you need some help?

665
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:12,182
No. I'll have it
first thing Monday.

666
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:13,542
Yes, you will.

667
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:28,397
Yes?

668
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:30,611
Mr. Draper, I'm sorry
I was unprepared.

669
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:33,454
Don't let it happen again.

670
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,075
Well, it's... it's just that...

671
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:39,517
What?

672
00:43:39,892 --> 00:43:42,358
$110 is a lot of money for me.

673
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,416
Your bail.

674
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:50,081
Right.

675
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:57,559
Here.

676
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:00,516
I'll give you 50 tomorrow.

677
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:05,023
I guess when you try
to forget something,

678
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,093
you have to forget everything.

679
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,234
Thank you, Don.

680
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,289
Draper. Some kind
of tomato farm you got here.

681
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:26,917
Window dressing's important.

682
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,981
Can I get you anything?

683
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,595
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

684
00:44:34,268 --> 00:44:35,818
Blondie, wait outside.

685
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,434
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.

686
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:47,024
You don't. What happened
to the flipper there?

687
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:48,594
Old football injury.

688
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:50,566
Yeah. I get those, too.

689
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:52,735
Have a seat.

690
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,321
No need. I'll keep this short.

691
00:44:57,107 --> 00:44:58,521
I just want to thank you

692
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,784
for convincing the folks at Utz
to let me do the show.

693
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:03,728
My pleasure.

694
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:06,649
We all got what we
wanted, didn't we?

695
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:08,307
What I'm trying to say is,
the way I behaved,

696
00:45:08,427 --> 00:45:10,488
I wouldn't have been surprised
if you would have, you know,

697
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,796
looked the other way on
this thing, blocked it up.

698
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,725
Why would I do that?

699
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:16,521
This guy.

700
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:19,095
I can't tell if he's
being smug or not.

701
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:23,390
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not a bad guy.

702
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,928
You didn't have to come all
the way out here to say that.

703
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:28,103
I know that.

704
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:29,871
Nobody knows that.

705
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,958
You're a cool cat, Donnie.

706
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:37,645
Bye, Mr. Draper.

707
00:45:53,522 --> 00:45:54,838
Daddy! Daddy!

708
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:00,177
How was your day?

709
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:03,253
I made it.

710
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:24,287
Where's the salt?

711
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:29,296
Come on, Bets. No salt?

712
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,151
You'll see. You'll get used to it.

713
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:33,752
It's for your own good.

714
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:39,597
What would we do without you?

715
00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:42,772
Why can't Daddy have salt?

716
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:45,721
Because we love him.
