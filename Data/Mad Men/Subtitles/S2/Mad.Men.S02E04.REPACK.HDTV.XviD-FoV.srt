00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:32,476
Mad Men 2x4
<i>Three Sundays</i>

2
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,651
But when the flesh lusts
against the spirit

3
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,503
and the spirit against the flesh,

4
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:46,007
the rational soul is supported
by the Cross of Christ.

5
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:49,913
Nor does it,
when seduced by evil desires,

6
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,030
consent to evil doings,

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,310
for it is pierced
by the nails of continence

8
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:57,143
and the fear of God.

9
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:00,404
And, as at all times,
we must live worthily,

10
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,903
so at all times
we must bear the Cross,

12
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,778
which for each one
is rightly called His,

13
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,906
for it is born by each one...

14
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:10,655
I'm not feeling so good.

15
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:13,708
That's because you're hung over.
I can smell it.

16
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:15,745
We have supper.

17
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:18,070
She's been fasting all day.
I need your help.

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,330
And as a rule, there is a greater
danger in the hidden betrayer

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,878
than in the open foe.

20
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,927
- Is there a draft? I'll close it.
- No, Father.

21
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:33,599
Are you with one of these two?

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,229
No.

23
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:38,476
Okay, turn around.

24
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,967
If you see me again and
I'm not smiling,

25
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,019
I don't think you're
going to like it.

26
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,067
Now get back in there.

27
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,101
Are you leaving?

28
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,137
Just to get some air.

29
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,253
You don't have to be polite.

30
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,897
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to lie to you in here.

31
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:05,086
- I'm Father Gill.
- I'm Peggy Olsen.

32
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,281
- Katherine Olsen's girl.
- Yes.

33
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,449
I'm having dinner at your sister's.

34
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,526
- Are you a new priest?
- I'm visiting.

35
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,028
So are you going to come back in?

36
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:19,715
Yes.

37
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:36,526
Hello.

38
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,114
Good morning, Caroline.

39
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:42,903
Yes.

40
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,591
We're up.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Barbecue.

42
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,651
Right.

43
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,033
Caroline, we went over this.

44
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,153
Steaks.

45
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,668
And the kids can eat hot dogs.

46
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,217
Cancel.

47
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,328
I'm sorry. What?

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,962
I don't know.

49
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:04,588
Jell-O?

50
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:07,565
Do you want me to pick
something else up?

51
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,466
Cancel.

52
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,426
Caroline, hold on a sec.

53
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:13,717
I can't.

54
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,454
Caroline, I feel terrible
about this,

55
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:25,364
but Don's not feeling well.

56
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:27,699
No. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,924
The 22nd?

58
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:34,862
Isn't that Easter?

59
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,393
Good.

60
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,075
Bye-bye.

61
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,716
What's with you?

62
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:43,885
I don't know.

63
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:46,890
I had an amazing dream.

64
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,807
- ... always hogging the TV.
- I don't like baby stuff.

65
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,911
Get out. We're... sleeping.

66
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,329
Get some Raisin Bran.

67
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,199
You can eat it in the den.

68
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,449
Out!

69
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:10,325
Out!

70
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,885
I should have locked the door.

71
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,581
Here's number 2, sir.

72
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,051
Thank you, Jeeves.

73
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,400
Why are we in the living room?

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,034
Because we live here.

75
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,669
What did I say about the stereo?

76
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:53,713
I wasn't touching it.

77
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,675
Bobby, I saw you do it.

78
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:00,261
- I didn't do it.
- Go watch TV, both of you.

79
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,516
I love this song.

80
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,237
His voice is like silk,

81
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,236
and you can really hear the words.

82
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,583
He makes everything
sound like Christmas.

83
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,914
In high school I used to love
dancing to this song.

84
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:28,557
Come dance with me.

85
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:34,170
- We weren't doing anything today.
- Hurry. It's almost over.

86
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,785
I hate to think about your
reputation in high school.

87
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,034
Are you going to sit at the table?

88
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,365
Gerry, could you get it?

89
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,158
- Jesus, Anita, I can't move.
- Watch your language!

90
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,061
And I don't care
if you have to lay there.

91
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,288
- Put your shoes on!
- Little Gerry, get my shoes!

92
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,914
Do you want me to get the door?

93
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,762
I can't reach my toes.
What am I supposed to do?

94
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,020
Hello, Father.

95
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,348
You're not leaving, are you?

96
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,099
Hello, Father. I'm sorry I'm late.

97
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:27,052
I... I went by Green-Wood
to visit my son.

98
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:29,772
Well, I would love to meet him.

99
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,310
It's a cemetery.

100
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:33,574
Father, welcome.

101
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:36,096
Come before it gets cold.

102
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,921
Hello, Father.

103
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,099
I'm sorry I missed Mass.
My back is out.

104
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:42,608
He hasn't been feeling well,

105
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,664
but he did his part.
He watched the baby.

106
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:47,410
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

107
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:49,037
We all do.

108
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,913
I'm sorry. I got to lay down.

109
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,921
Please, please.

110
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:55,668
Come.

111
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,285
Of course, Father. Right this way.

112
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:00,339
We have you here.

113
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,509
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!

114
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,143
They've disappeared.

115
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,182
Don't wait for them.

116
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,419
Father, would you honor us
and say grace?

117
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:15,992
Certainly. Why not?

118
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,496
O Lord, thank you
for this wonderful feast.

119
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,479
Thank you for these people

120
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,649
and this parish and their home.

121
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,420
That was beautiful.

122
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,663
Are you doing to say grace now?

123
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:38,672
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

124
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,727
we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

125
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,028
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

126
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,165
Through Christ our Lord.

127
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:45,285
Amen.

128
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,584
Monsignor says you have
a beautiful singing voice.

129
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,112
And you play the harmonica?

130
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:05,524
The guitar.

131
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,650
I actually learned
how to play the mandolin

132
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,617
when I was in Rome. And soccer.

133
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,870
- Did you meet the Holy Father?
- Not exactly.

134
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,777
It's kind of like
being in Washington

135
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:17,204
and asking if you've
met the President.

136
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:19,509
But you know
when he's in the building.

137
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,332
- Aren't you going to have one?
- Should I?

138
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:26,588
Well, I'm not going
to drink by myself.

139
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,158
I'll get the sherry.

140
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:29,905
I'll get it, Ma.

141
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,976
I've always wanted to go to Rome.

142
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,309
Yes, well, Vatican City
is one thing,

143
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,962
but then you realize
you're in Italy.

144
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:42,019
- Peggy works in Manhattan.
- Really?

145
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,901
- What do you do, Peggy?
- She works on Madison Avenue.

146
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:47,697
She comes up with the
words in advertisements.

147
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:49,853
They call it copywriting, Ma.

148
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,539
Father, I'm glad you're here.

149
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,485
I didn't know they knew what I did.

150
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:55,791
Stop it. No, you should see her work.

151
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,833
Lipstick, reducing
programs, feminine products.

152
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,726
Mom, not in front of Father.

153
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:02,503
She used to do
her presentations for us.

154
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:04,411
She uses Latin.

155
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,302
I'm sorry to do this,
but I really should go.

156
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,369
Look at that.
Well, where are you headed?

157
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,186
I'll give you a lift.
I have a car.

158
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,129
To the 4th Avenue BMT?

159
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,937
It is such an honor
to have you in our house.

160
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,039
And I'm sorry the chicken
was overcooked.

161
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,317
The chicken was perfect,
and you know that.

162
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:28,353
- Go get the Brownie.
- Let me wrap up some cake.

163
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,732
Thank you, but no,
thank you, Anita.

164
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,451
You've all really made me homesick.

165
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:35,745
Father, would you mind?

166
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,087
Say cheese.

167
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,529
Cheese. Cheese.

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,034
Brooks,

169
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:59,644
have you made any decision
about our immediate future?

170
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:01,955
Believe it or not, Daddy,

171
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,732
Brooks has other interests
besides drinking.

172
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,692
That'll change.

173
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,643
Would you stop scaring them?

174
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:10,026
We're not scared.

175
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,145
Then how is it you've been
engaged for two months

176
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,955
and you're not running
around making wedding plans?

177
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,525
Because I told you.

178
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,371
We don't like the idea
of having a big wedding.

179
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,397
It doesn't have to be big.

180
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,967
We think it's silly.

181
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,951
You have to invite
a bunch of strangers to gawk at us

182
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,838
to somehow prove
our feelings for each other.

183
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,616
You know, it's embarrassing.

184
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:34,892
Brooks?

185
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,036
Whatever she wants.

186
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,707
Well, your mother wants a wedding.

187
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:43,896
Mommy had a wedding.

188
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,016
I did.

189
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,771
Wearing that dress,

190
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:50,336
my sister and my mother
fussing over me.

191
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,331
It w the best I ever
looked in my life.

192
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:54,532
The Pierre.

193
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,109
I was drunk, and I didn't
have a glass of champagne.

194
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,312
Gliding around
in your father's arms.

195
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:05,112
You know how good a dancer he is.

196
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:09,880
Dancing with Grandpa.
I don't want you to miss that.

197
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,253
What are you getting?

198
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,977
I'll have the mussels
with garlic if you do.

199
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,328
That's sweet.

200
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,533
- Thank you for the ride, Father.
- Peggy, wait.

201
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,453
Yes?

202
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,809
I want to ask you about something,

203
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,611
and it's personal.

204
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,098
I have the honor of delivering
the sermon next Sunday.

205
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,210
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.

206
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,335
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.

207
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,530
And, well...

208
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,065
you said you did presentations.

209
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,130
Can I run some things past you?

210
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,694
I don't know what I could tell you.
You must do this all the time.

211
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,653
I've done it, but your monsignor is
a tough act to follow.

212
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,036
I don't know
that I'm your audience.

213
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,091
You were leaving,

214
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,984
and we ended up
having supper together,

215
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:29,024
and you're the only
person in this parish

216
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:32,295
that knows about public speaking.
This is how God works.

217
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:38,283
I find that if I'm prepared

218
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,780
and... and I have confidence
in what I'm selling,

219
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,766
that kills the butterflies.

220
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:45,313
That's good.

221
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:46,950
I'm prepared.

222
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,603
Do you have any other tips?

223
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:55,616
Pick somebody, and make
eye contact with them.

224
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:59,073
You'd think it would make you nervous,
but it really focuses you.

225
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:05,955
Don't they have stuff that you're
supposed to talk about?

226
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,241
Yes, they have stuff.

227
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:12,016
Let's just say I'm covered
in the content department.

228
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,571
I can only speak for myself,

229
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:19,195
but the sermon
is the only part of Mass

230
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,508
that's in English,

231
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:22,854
and it's very hard
to tell sometimes.

232
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,922
Maybe be simpler?

233
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,978
Give us a chance of understanding.

234
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:34,442
Thank you for the ride. I should go.
I really do have to work.

235
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:35,844
Idle hands.

236
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,695
It's good to know you.
Have a great week.

237
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,091
I hate my feet.

238
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:08,007
I love your feet, Mommy.

239
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,725
Feet? I thought
those were water skis.

240
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Stop it.

241
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,425
Stop it! Stop it!

242
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:16,833
Stop it!

243
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,027
Great.

244
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,965
- You broke it.
- I didn't mean to.

245
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,228
You're being wild in the house.

246
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,496
It's late.

247
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,581
Everybody brush your
teeth and go to bed.

248
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,374
I'm hungry.

249
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:36,002
- You're going to bed.
- We didn't have any dinner.

250
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,996
It's 7:30.

251
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:46,262
Okay. Come downstairs.
I'll make you some grilled cheese.

252
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,014
Go.

253
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,186
Go.

254
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,356
Go. Come on.

255
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,532
And my wife says, "Duck and cover."

256
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:13,999
Look at this.

257
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,712
- Marty, meet Vicki.
- Hello, Marty.

258
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,820
I've heard so much about you,

259
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:24,510
but you didn't tell me
about his wonderful head.

260
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,186
What about it?

261
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:28,305
Someone thinks a lot.

262
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:30,557
Look at that.
It's love at first rub.

263
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:33,561
My head has been known
to make wishes come true.

264
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:36,938
Don't get up.

265
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:39,336
This is Marty Hasselbach,
from Gorton's.

266
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:40,943
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.

267
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,809
We were due to meet
tomorrow anyway.

268
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,613
Love that frozen scrod. Thank you.

269
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,657
I'm Vicki, Marty's wife.

270
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,239
Aren't you a lucky man?

271
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,789
Yes. Yes, I am.

272
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,189
We were just discussing
the male head.

273
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,814
Is that right?

274
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,784
I like the Yul Brynner look.

275
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:02,345
She does seem to.

276
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:05,001
I keep threatening
to shave him one morning.

277
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,344
Just hop in the shower
and take it all off.

278
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,127
Is that right?

279
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:12,249
- How long have you two been married?
- Five years.

280
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:15,853
Second time around.
That explains it.

281
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,315
It's nice to meet you.

282
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,191
I hope to see you both tomorrow.

283
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:23,933
A pleasure.

284
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,995
<i>Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Barrett
is here at my desk.</i>

285
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,892
No. Of course. Send her in.

286
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,689
Mrs. Barrett, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

287
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,842
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you.

288
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,149
I'm not sure how they do it
in show business,

289
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:54,125
but around he we have this nifty gadget
called an appointment book.

290
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:55,942
I was in the neighborhood.

291
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,439
What did Jimmy do now,
ask Eleanor Roosevelt

292
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,895
how fast her husband
ran the hundred-yard dash?

293
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:04,692
- How are you?
- Busy.

294
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,969
I have an idea
for a television show.

295
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,793
Congratulations.

296
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,533
Is it too early to have a drink?

297
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,358
- Let me call for some ice.
- No need.

298
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,499
How do I make this happen?
Where do I go?

299
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,709
What is it?

300
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,300
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?

301
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,049
Hidden camera situations.

302
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,488
Only Jimmy's the host,

303
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,358
and he's Jimmy, you know?

304
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:29,550
Not nice.

305
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,055
It's derivative, with a twist.

306
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,355
That's what they're looking for.

307
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:37,558
It's called Grin and Barrett.

308
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,544
That's cute.

309
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:41,685
I thought it up all by myself.

310
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,368
ABC's sick about
losingCandid Camera.

311
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:47,322
But you'd have to get Jimmy
out of his contract with Utz.

312
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,987
I thought about that.

313
00:17:49,107 --> 00:17:51,698
It's exclusive, but they
could come on as sponsors.

314
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,868
Show needs a national sponsor.
Utz won't do you any good.

315
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,121
You're a pessimist.

316
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,999
They could let him out.
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.

317
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,133
They don't care.

318
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,004
But they could be told

319
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,257
that their spots
would have more punch,

320
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:11,676
wherever they air, if Jimmy's
on a hit television show.

321
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:16,056
That is very good advice.

322
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,748
Will you sell the show for me?

323
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,590
I'm not interested in doing that.

324
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,956
But I can talk to the Schillings.

325
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,907
What's this?

326
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,181
I was thinking how I could avoid
getting bored with you.

327
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:03,385
Bobbi, I have work.

328
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:05,485
Bullshit.

329
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:12,488
It's good. But we should sell them
on the mascot first.

330
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:14,531
The jingle's going to be a cutie.

331
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:17,485
Hasselbach's at 3, right?

332
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,714
Is he bringing the missus?

333
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,385
Mary, that'll be all for now.

334
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,422
Roger,

335
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,396
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,

336
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:34,935
and that's not her.

337
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:38,357
I see.

338
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:40,682
That makes sense.

339
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:44,061
I've got her number if you want it.
I've got lots of numbers.

340
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,194
No. That's okay.

341
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,473
Keep up the good work.

342
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:53,365
Daddy!

343
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,328
You need to shave.
You need to shave.

344
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:03,503
Some people weren't so good today.

345
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,240
What happened?

346
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,310
Bobby broke the record player.

347
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,574
The repair call is going to be $18.

348
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:13,867
9 if you want to put it in your car
and drag it over there.

349
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:14,987
I don't.

350
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,664
When I asked him about it,
he said he didn't do it.

351
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,560
He lied to my face.

352
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:23,550
- Where is he?
- In his room.

353
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:40,457
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.

354
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,699
I believe her.

355
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:43,904
Don't do that again.

356
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:45,845
I won't.

357
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:57,515
That's it?

358
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,772
I said to him
"wait till your father gets home,"

359
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,569
and that's what he gets...
"go to sleep."

360
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,113
He knows he did something wrong.

361
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,681
First the Shenanigans
with the washing machine,

362
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,336
and now the record player.

363
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:09,229
Don, you have to do something.
He needs a spanking.

364
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,644
How else is he going to learn
the difference between right and wrong?

365
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,086
That's not the way it works.

366
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,652
You think you'd be the man you are today
if your father didn't hit you?

367
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:21,178
Can I get something to eat?

368
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,251
You left this by the bed.

369
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,688
I'll do it.

370
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:46,268
Draper residence.

371
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,338
<i>Good. You're there. It's Duck.</i>

372
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,229
Sunday morning.
Where else would I be?

373
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,444
Shel Keneally called me
late last night.

374
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:55,508
American Airlines already scheduled
a bunch of pitches for this week.

375
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:57,751
Why are we on the calendar
for two weeks from now?

376
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,125
<i>We're not anymore.
I got us Good Friday first thing.</i>

377
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,699
Most of the team's already here.
The rest are on their way.

378
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:08,528
Hello?

379
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:10,627
- Let me look.
- It hurts!

380
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,975
I walk out of the room
for 10 seconds?

381
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,806
He needs to go
to the emergency room.

382
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,205
That was Duck Phillips
on the phone.

383
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,013
American Airlines moved up
their presentation.

384
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,841
- So?
- So I have to go in.

385
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:21,884
Damn it.

386
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:26,515
One child in the emergency room
is enough to deal with. Take Sally.

387
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,557
Send Sally to Francine's.

388
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:32,020
It's Palm Sunday. I am not about
to impose on Francine today.

389
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,172
I want to go with Daddy.

390
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,888
Hello, Father Gill. Come in.

391
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:02,481
Come in. Father, welcome.

392
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:06,072
I'm terribly sorry, Anita, Mrs. Olsen.
I can't stay.

393
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,096
- No.
- That's terrible.

394
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:11,763
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.

395
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:14,953
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti
has taken a turn for the worse.

396
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:17,316
- I hope you'll forgive me.
- That poor woman.

397
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,359
Let me fix you a paper plate.

398
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,008
- Peggy didn't make it?
- She's sick.

399
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,740
Could you give her this?
It is a copy of my sermon.

400
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,536
She helped me quite a bit,
and I would love for her to see it.

401
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,972
Peggy helped you write something?

402
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:35,012
- Just some tips, really.
- It was very good.

403
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,561
I felt like I was the only one
you were talking to.

404
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,819
Well, thank you.
Again, I'm sorry.

405
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,533
It's so nice he's taken
an interest in her.

406
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,517
Come, let's eat.

407
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,812
Mr. Phillips and the others
are in the conference room.

408
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,294
I see you've brought
a little helper.

409
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,753
Betty had her hands full today.

410
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,997
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.

411
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,976
Keep her away
from the paper cutter.

412
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:29,064
Friday morning,

413
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,079
the American Airlines folks
will join us at 10.

414
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:34,086
Roger will handle the introductions.
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,

415
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,045
creative to the right,
accounts to the left,

416
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:38,707
starting with myself, then the America
Airlines people, then Campbell.

417
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,638
Pete, you're next
to our man Shel Keneally.

418
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:43,024
There will be one for each of them.

419
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:45,619
We can't get cordovan by Friday,
so we're going with maroon.

420
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:46,938
Campbell will run the show.

421
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,157
He has a list of every ad
we need in the presentation.

422
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:52,001
Art department needs to make sure
that every image we use in a comp

423
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:53,676
is an airplane that American has.

424
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,664
No cutting and pasting
planes from other ads.

425
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,450
They may all look alike
to us, but...

426
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,625
Why are you here?

427
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:02,183
I'm head of the televion department.

428
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,441
We have 90 minutes to present.
I'll do the setup...

429
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:09,230
the history of American Airlines
up to and including the crash.

430
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,253
I'll tee up creative
with what research says

431
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,264
travelers are waiting
to hear from American,

432
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,308
and then, Don,
you do what you do.

433
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,453
Maybe you could give us
a little peek.

434
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:20,570
I'm not ready to do that yet.

435
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:28,714
I say we show all three campaigns,
eliminate all possible objections.

436
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:30,772
Something for everybody.

437
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:33,634
Remember, this isn't the work
we have to run in the end.

438
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:35,513
This is about winning
these guys over.

439
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,372
Creative.

440
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:40,820
In my office.

441
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,570
You have big ones.

442
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:47,723
My mommy has big ones, too,

443
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:50,843
and I'm going to have
big ones when I grow up.

444
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:01,525
I don't care if we're just
selling a point of view,

445
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,504
but we have to commit
to one thing.

446
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:05,194
They don't like wiggle room.

447
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,777
They like to see us blowing
up bridges behind us.

448
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,668
These are the boards for the
60-second television spots.

449
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:12,448
Music you can talk over.

450
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:15,084
Stewardesses.

451
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,184
We're going to bookend every spot
with the plane taking off and landing

452
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,883
up, down, no problems,

453
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:22,986
everything okay, every commercial.

454
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,380
Where's that list
Duck's buddy Shel gave us

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,198
with all the things that
make American different?

456
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:35,125
What's that?

457
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,017
The ad you asked for
to recruit stewardesses.

458
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,694
It equates what should
be a glamorous job

459
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,681
with being a waitress
in a tin can.

460
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:46,690
Where's the bar of soap,
the ticket sleeves?

461
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:48,467
Who's doing the in-flight menu?

462
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,612
I think it's the best
menu I've ever written.

463
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,565
This is in French.
How do I know it's right?

464
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:55,658
It's right.

465
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:58,099
Make up a chef.

466
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,443
Peggy, did you pick out
a china pattern yet?

467
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:01,693
Did you find the one
from the Queen Mary?

468
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:02,624
Yes.

469
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,418
But there needs to be a decision
if we're doing anything to the logo.

470
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,509
I don't know.

471
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,837
We got a lot of bricks,

472
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:14,684
but I don't know
what the building looks like.

473
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,615
So how are you, Vicki?

474
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:38,953
I'm in a very good mood.

475
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:44,873
I hate to sound remedial,

476
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:47,715
but I haven't done this
since I was in the Navy.

477
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:49,588
Been with a girl?

478
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,188
No. Not that.

479
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:53,194
Don't worry.

480
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:56,052
The prices may have changed,
but the menu's still the same.

481
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,511
Well, your invoice
ran across my desk.

482
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:14,326
Look at you.

483
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:21,898
The menu hasn't changed.

484
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,600
Is it open for negotiation?

485
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:30,304
I don't want to ruin the magic.

486
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,435
How about double plus carfare?

487
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,676
And I'll assume you live far away.

488
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:38,969
That'll be $100.

489
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,391
But I want everything I want.

490
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,355
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?

491
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,751
That's not so bad, is it?

492
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,305
I have to warn you,
I'm not in great health.

493
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:10,481
Don't believe what they say.

494
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:17,633
No one dies doing this.

495
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:22,823
Are you resting?

496
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:24,908
Everybody's resting.

497
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:27,435
No. I'm thinking.

498
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,146
Let's have a conversation.

499
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,653
Is that your maid?

500
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,948
No. She's my girlfriend.

501
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:41,449
Do you kiss her?

502
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:43,451
Sometimes.

503
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,765
Do you lay on top of her?

504
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,238
You know what, Sally?

505
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:52,544
Your daddy's going to be angry
if I don't do my work.

506
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,974
Just a minute, girls.
It's almost your turn.

507
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:13,754
You know, we'll get to go
anywhere American flies.

508
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,238
Familiarization.

509
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:18,285
We'll have to rent another floor.
We'll all have our own offices.

510
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:22,031
Do you realize we will get
to pick out the stewardesses?

511
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,163
Son of a bitch.

512
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,208
You there.

513
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,214
Chewing your cud.

514
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:41,301
It's one thing to be unladylike.

515
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,887
It's another to treat our office

516
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:45,889
like a subway platform.

517
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,546
Pack up your Wrigley's
and go home.

518
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:53,428
How could it be my gum?
My gum's in my mouth.

519
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,275
This place is a zoo.

520
00:30:57,885 --> 00:31:00,307
Thank you for getting him
out of here for the day.

521
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,580
Lose the gum then get
yourself some dinner.

522
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,548
He won't rember firing you.

523
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,964
American Airlines is not about
the past any more than America is.

524
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:25,428
Ask not about Cuba.
Ask not about the bomb.

525
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,136
We're going to the moon.

526
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:28,556
Throw everything out.

527
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,225
Everything?

528
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:34,020
There is no such thing
as American history, only a frontier.

529
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,358
That crash happened to somebody else.

530
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:40,318
It's not about apologies
for what happened.

531
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,890
It's about those sen men
in the room on Friday

532
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,240
and what airline they are
going to be running.

533
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,492
So what does that mean?

534
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,703
Let's pretend we know
what 1963 looks like.

535
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:04,648
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.

536
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:07,062
What's that leave us with,
introductions?

537
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:09,603
If I can't mention the crash,
there's no preamble at all.

538
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:10,743
Let it go.

539
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:14,452
Our job is to bend down the branch.
Let him pick the fruit.

540
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:37,333
That champagne is probably near frozen

541
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:40,098
I'm meeting a friend.

542
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:42,797
You know what I really want?

543
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,092
Is there something we left out?

544
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,552
Have dinner with me?

545
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,639
I told you I'm meeting a friend.

546
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,725
I'll pay for his meeting, too.

547
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:58,106
You wouldn't think dinner
would be pushing it on the extras.

548
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,356
Have you been to Lutèce yet?

549
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:03,818
I have. I think you'd like it.

550
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:06,953
I've got it.

551
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,948
It's great, but they're cheeky.

552
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:15,788
They started with this
prix fixe menu at lunch.

553
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:17,670
8.50 for lunch.

554
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,898
And they have these wines.

555
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:22,395
What kind of wine do you like?

556
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:23,907
I don't know. Red?

557
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:27,837
They're going to make you be
more specific than that.

558
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,884
We can walk, if you don't
mind a little rain.

559
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:37,775
You know what? I love the sound
of cabs whooshing in the water.

560
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,641
Shall we?

561
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,777
Isn't this a nice time?

562
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:47,827
Absolutely.

563
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:02,896
She's here on a Sunday,
and I respect that,

564
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:05,681
but you know she's earning
more than all of us.

565
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:09,983
Come up.

566
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,226
Up.

567
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,424
Up.

568
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,483
Good night, ladies.

569
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,603
Thanks for babysitting.

570
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,117
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.

571
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:30,802
Your sister wants to talk.

572
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:34,265
Hey, Pegs.

573
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:40,793
It was good. He gave us a copy
of his sermon to give to you.

574
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,046
Okay, so long.

575
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,964
It's nice that he can get to know her
without all her troubles.

576
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:50,213
She's such a beautiful young girl.

577
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:53,993
She does whatever she feels like
with no regard at all.

578
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,133
You're too easy on her.
You know that.

579
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:00,161
Is Gerry warming up the car?

580
00:35:57,611 --> 00:36:00,286
Shel Keneally was fired
this morning.

581
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:03,019
What?

582
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:06,291
The rest are on their way in.

583
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:09,120
- What's going on?
- It's over.

584
00:36:09,748 --> 00:36:11,591
So why are they coming in?

585
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,947
Because they have to.

586
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:17,990
And we have to deliver
a stillborn baby.

587
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,044
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are here
from American Airlines.

588
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,624
Send them in.

589
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:39,097
<i>In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti, amen.</i>

590
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:42,859
In the name of the Father, Son,
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

591
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,289
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

592
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,636
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

593
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:54,503
I took something
that didn't belong to me.

594
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,376
Go on.

595
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:01,382
I was in the Laundromat,
and I took

596
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:04,600
some coins off the machine
and used them.

597
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:09,844
I took the Lord's name
in vain three times,

598
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:11,663
and...

599
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:17,663
and I am so angry, Father.

600
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,077
I am so angry at my little sister.

601
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:27,265
She's causing my mother
so much pain.

602
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,981
She had a child out of wedlock.

603
00:37:33,433 --> 00:37:36,955
She seduced a married man.
It's a terrible sin,

604
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,428
and she acts like it
didn't even happen.

605
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:45,136
And I hate her for it.

606
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,935
And I feel so guilty about it.

607
00:37:51,754 --> 00:37:54,443
But everyone keeps
falling all over themselves

608
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,233
trying to help her.

609
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,003
And she goes on
like nothing happened.

610
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:04,004
Nothing at all.

611
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,557
What about me, Father?

612
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:13,631
My troubles?

613
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,361
What about me being good?
For what?

614
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,611
I understand it's difficult.

615
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:24,474
You know it's not
your place to judge.

616
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,731
God sees your goodness.

617
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,695
It doesn't feel that way, Father.

618
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:32,815
Try to trust God on this.

619
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:36,618
You will get your reward in heaven.

620
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:39,065
God loves you,

621
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:41,530
and He knows
that you love your sister.

622
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:44,116
I do.

623
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:48,391
Say three Hail Marys
and two Our Fathers.

624
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:51,179
And try to forgive your sister.

625
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,323
She's not as strong as you are.

626
00:38:55,924 --> 00:38:58,339
Would you like to make
your Act of Contrition?

627
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,221
O my God,

628
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,123
I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

629
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,248
I detest all my sins

630
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:10,810
because I dread
the loss of heaven...

631
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:24,407
Cooper walked them to the elevator.

632
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:25,866
They acted impressed.

633
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,966
I just can't believe it.

634
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,400
Here. You should have this.

635
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:54,770
No regrets, fellas. We were in it.
That's the important thing.

636
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,490
It's heaking.

637
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:58,851
But still, good work, Don.

638
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,700
Come on.

639
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:12,204
We hired him to bring in new business,
not lose old business.

640
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,065
Don't you love the chase?

641
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,523
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

642
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,047
Those are the stakes.

643
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,777
But when it does work out...

644
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:28,554
it's like having
that first cigarette.

645
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:30,863
Head gets all dizzy.

646
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:32,818
Your heart pounds,

647
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:34,510
knees go weak.

648
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,854
Remember that?

649
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:41,362
Old business is just old business.

650
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,554
- You're home early.
- It's Good Friday.

651
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:56,745
How did it go?

652
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,517
It didn't.

653
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,797
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

654
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,250
Do you want to talk about it?

655
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:12,641
No.

656
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:17,019
How was your day?

657
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:19,794
My father called.
He's doing better.

658
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:24,026
He and William played golf yesterday.
William made a show of paying for it.

659
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,772
- Bobby, what did I just say?
- It was accident.

660
00:41:28,892 --> 00:41:31,370
You don't listen.
Don, do something.

661
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:39,781
Is that what you wanted?

662
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:47,666
You take no responsibility
for anything that goes on in this house.

663
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:50,206
I pay the bills,
put clothes on your back,

664
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:51,762
your damn stables.

665
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,244
Don't you dare.

666
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,350
I'm here all day,
alone with them, out numbered.

667
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,144
What about Carla?
Doesn't she count?

668
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:00,496
It's not her job
to raise our children!

669
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:04,191
I'm here, and then you come
home and get to be the hero.

670
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,261
You want me to bring home
what I got at the office today?

671
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:09,187
I'll put you through that window.

672
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,876
Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.

673
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,618
- Bobby, it's not a good time.
- I'm sorry.

674
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:41,243
It's okay.

675
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,357
Dads get mad sometimes.

676
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,912
Did your daddy get mad?

677
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:51,334
He did.

678
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,376
What did your daddy look like?

679
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,870
Like me,

680
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,297
but bigger.

681
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:03,771
What did he like to eat?

682
00:43:08,146 --> 00:43:08,968
Ham.

683
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:13,545
And this candy.

684
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:16,147
It tasted like violets.

685
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,704
Had a beautiful purple
and silver package.

686
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:25,997
What did he do?

687
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,026
I told you, he was a farmer.

688
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:33,745
But he died.

689
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:37,683
A long time ago.

690
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:43,599
We have to get you a new daddy.

691
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,570
Come here.

692
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,538
You have nothing to say?

693
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:26,997
What do you want to hear?

694
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:30,831
Something. Anything.

695
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:35,425
How about you're going
to help raise these children,

696
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:36,677
not be one?

697
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:40,028
Bets, you do whatever you want.

698
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:41,989
It's not about what I do.

699
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,394
He's a little kid.

700
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,936
My father beat the hell out of me.

701
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:56,124
All it did was make me fantasize

702
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:58,291
about the day I could murder him.

703
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:04,995
I didn't know that.

704
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:08,432
And I wasn't half as good as Bobby.

705
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:58,544
- Happy Easter, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

706
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:00,876
I read your sermon. I liked it.

707
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:04,416
- It was very colloquial.
- You were very helpful.

708
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:14,458
