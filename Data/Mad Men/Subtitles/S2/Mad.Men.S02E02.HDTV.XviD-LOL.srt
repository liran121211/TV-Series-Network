1
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:33,418
Mad Men 2x2
<i>Flight 1</i>

2
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:44,956
Sounds like the place.

3
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,163
I couldn't believe there were
two parties on this block.

4
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:49,885
I have no problem with Negroes.
I'm just worried about the car.

5
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:53,287
We can still go home.
This was your idea.

6
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:55,729
It's important
that we're here... for you.

7
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,474
- For the people that work for you.
- Lovely, go easy on that.

8
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:01,741
- Some of them don't feel that way.
- Is my nose running?

9
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,414
- How are you?
- Hi.

10
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:28,038
Sorry about that, buddy.

12
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:29,634
What did you do with your coats?

14
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,465
We left them in the car.

15
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,601
When we called to get directions
from somewhere else in New Jersey,

16
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,471
Paul gave Harry the idea.

17
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:37,907
I took my purse.

18
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,979
I smell alcohol,
but I don't see it.

19
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,630
- It's him.
- It's a party.

20
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,986
Cosgrove's doing great.

21
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,913
- Let's go get a drink.
- I'm going to stay here.

22
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,202
Come with me.

23
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,974
So you work for these
stuffed shirts?

24
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:02,459
I work with them.

25
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,409
- Glad to see a familiar face.
- Yes. How are you?

26
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:06,977
Introduce us to your friend.

27
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:09,785
Eugene, whom I just met,
was telling me that at Princeton

28
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,880
Paul used to dress up like a girl.

29
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,971
According to him, that's the way
Shakespeare did it.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,223
Looking stunning, as always.

31
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,938
Much too good for him.

32
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,022
What are you doing out here?

33
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,016
Not enough subterraneans
in the Village?

34
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,728
I'm here because
this isn't Greenwich Village.

35
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,194
This is America.

36
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:30,771
How do you get to the city?

37
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,645
The number 33 bus takes you
right to Port Authority.

38
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,658
Trust me, Montclair is the knees.

39
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:39,788
We have Globe Trotter Antiques.
We have the Wellmont Theater.

40
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:42,424
Silent movies with organ.

41
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,831
The Montclair Art Gallery.
George Inness.

42
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,212
- Have you heard of him?
- Of course I have.

43
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:49,205
Come.

44
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,325
Enjoy.

45
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:51,514
Imbibe.

46
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:01,142
You're a button, you know that?

47
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,118
And you're drunk.

48
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:08,276
Can't get Donna here on my desk
because she keeps refusing.

49
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,353
You're not allowed to do that.

50
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:11,986
I can't feel my cheeks.

51
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:14,144
I can.

52
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:15,952
I feel them fine.

53
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:18,023
My mother says when you
can't feel your cheeks,

54
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,453
it's time to stop.

55
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,693
Well, whatan I do with this?

56
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:26,876
There. That works.

57
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:28,753
My God.

58
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,506
Don't you and Kitty have
some place to be?

59
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:39,250
Apparently, when they say "on call,"
it does not mean "available by phone."

60
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,807
You have to be in the hospital.

61
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,633
I'm sorry he didn't make it.

62
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,717
I'm looking forward to meeting him.
I've been having this pain right here.

63
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,511
- You've met him.
- How could I forget?

64
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:51,376
Big, handsome,

65
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:53,027
saves people's lives.

66
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,029
Why did you get the nice glass?

67
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,577
Because I have the "Rhône Gallagher".

68
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:02,953
Fine. What is it?

69
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:06,124
There's a ship
that went down in 1871,

70
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,439
and the casks of Rhne were on it.

71
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,525
It was a very good year.
And it sank,

72
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:14,632
and they washed up
on shore two years ago,

73
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:16,935
and they sold 180 bottles,

74
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,970
and I have one.

75
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:20,638
But not a sofa.

76
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,498
Joan, I want you to meet someone.

77
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,477
- My baby... Sheila.
- Sheila White.

78
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:31,733
- Joan is our senior secretary.
- Office manager.

79
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:33,565
Sheila's an assistant manager.

80
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,503
At the Food Fair in South Orange.

81
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,572
- She's saving for school.
- Kinsey!

82
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,310
- What?
- The man upstairs is here.

83
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,124
God?

84
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,435
It's, uh, Mr. Hoffenburg.

85
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,532
He wants to talk to you.
He smells marijuana.

86
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,248
Don't talk until I get back.

87
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,069
I'm serious.

88
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,315
I don't think we have
a Food Fair in Manhattan.

89
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,015
- Is it a big market with a parking lot?
- It is.

90
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,935
One day you'll drive in
in a station wagon and be a customer.

91
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,979
I grew up out here.
I've already been a customer.

92
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,317
It was fun to meet the boys,
put faces with names.

93
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,715
It's good to see you
and Paul together. I have to say,

94
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,206
when Paul and I were together,

95
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:23,117
the last thing I would have taken him
for was open-minded.

96
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:26,621
I love your purse.

97
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,374
Thanks. I just got it.

98
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,630
What's that?

99
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,504
Marjorie.

100
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,254
Works at the Newsstand.

101
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,374
I like.

102
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:44,222
But behind her.

103
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,237
You stole that.

104
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,645
That's from the office.
That dumb girl almost got fired.

105
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,409
But she didn't.

106
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,058
I'm a writer. I need it.

107
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,602
Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me.

108
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,675
Why not? I live alone.

109
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,336
Why should I?

110
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,353
Because I like you,
and we're having a good time,

111
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,530
and I'm a good kisser,

112
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,311
and you know you want to.

113
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:24,174
Eugene.

114
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,418
I'm in the persuasion business,

115
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,731
and frankly I'm disappointed
by your presentation.

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Oh, come on.

117
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,333
Fifth Avenue's a parking lot,
in both directions.

118
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,953
Traffic makes the parade
look bigger.

119
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,207
What parade?

120
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,887
Colonel Glenn.

121
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,572
It's incredible what passes
for heroism these days.

122
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:33,025
I'd like ticker tape for pulling
out of my driveway

123
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:34,915
and going around the block three times.

124
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,306
It's not like people were
shooting at him.

125
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,142
I think he's a winner.

126
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,469
Square jaw, false modesty.

127
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:43,950
Looks like he just took off
his letterman jacket.

128
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,254
You going to go down there
with your autograph book at lunch?

129
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,247
Can I just fire everyone?

130
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,256
Excuse me!

131
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,240
Excuse me!

132
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:11,160
This is a place of business.

133
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:14,122
Colonel Glenn will be on Earth
for the rest of his life.

134
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,312
Plane went down. American Airlines
Flight 1 to Los Angeles.

135
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:18,626
Crashed in Jamaica Bay.

136
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:22,637
<i>... had suddenly become locked
in a death dive into the bay...</i>

137
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,889
There could be
a hundred people on there.

138
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,342
Just fell out of the sky.

139
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,137
<i>... turn prescribed
by Idlewild Airport rules.</i>

140
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:43,700
Turn it off.

141
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:48,591
Pull all Mohawk ROP.

142
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,590
And anything in production, stop it.

143
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,153
But it wasn't a Mohawk plane.

144
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:54,241
We don't want people
opening their morning paper

145
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:57,282
and seeing a Mohawk ad
next to a picture of a floating engine.

146
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,093
The rest of you, stop crying

147
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:02,381
and figure out how we're going
to hit the ground running

148
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,098
in three weeks with new work.

149
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,524
Excuse me.

150
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,798
For one thing, we should probably
avoid the term "hit the ground."

151
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:14,014
How about "Idlewild to Rockaway
in less than eight minutes"?

152
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,089
Answer the phone, sweetheart.

153
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:26,167
Some of the passengers were
on their way to a golf tournament.

154
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:29,771
Apparently, the minute the plane hit,
the bay turned plaid.

155
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,035
Get back to work.

156
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,207
Jets are made for dropping bombs
on Moscow, not French cuisine.

157
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,757
Although I like those
little girls they have.

158
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,284
You know, they're completely captive.

159
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,426
<i>Mr. Phillips to see you.</i>

160
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,548
Send him in.

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,272
Someone should tell Draper
to pull everything from Mohawk.

162
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,028
He knows that.

163
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,159
I just had an interesting
conversation with Shel Keneally.

164
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,820
He's inside of American Airlines.

165
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,717
Is the plane still crashed?

166
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,654
Shel was a client
when I was at Y&R in London.

167
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,732
We had some times together.

168
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,963
It's complete chaos over there.

169
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:26,150
- They have any idea what went wrong?
- None.

170
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,591
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.

171
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,134
That's not comforting.

172
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,805
Shel says they're going to need
to make a fresh start.

173
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,676
Did he say fresh start?

174
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,125
A few times.

175
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,574
That is an interesting phone call.

176
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,153
Yes.

177
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,090
Yes.

178
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,799
I can't talk right now.

179
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,993
Mr. Campbell, are you all right?

180
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:43,414
Mr. Campbell?

181
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,504
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

182
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,234
What's going on?

183
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,864
I just got off the phone
with my brother.

184
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,280
It's the strangest thing.

185
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:03,225
Apparently, my father
was on that plane.

186
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,697
What?

187
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:12,360
My father, he was
on the... the plane.

188
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,178
God, I'm sorry to hear that.

189
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,602
I don't know what to do.

190
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:32,887
I just saw him

191
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,048
at the barber.

192
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,124
Paul Molé on Lex.

193
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,394
What does one do?

194
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,454
Make arrangements, I guess.

195
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,109
What am I supposed to do?

196
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:56,637
What people do.

197
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,196
Go home.

198
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:03,139
I don't even think
I know how old he was.

199
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,950
Someone's going to ask that.

200
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,208
- I Don't know. I suppose.
- You know what?

201
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,455
I don't think I'm going
to tell anyone.

202
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,091
Am I going to cry?

203
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,451
You just had a shock. I wouldn't...

204
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,258
worry about what you're feeling.

205
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,602
Go home and be with your family.

206
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:30,812
Why?

207
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,357
Because that's what people do.

208
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:35,025
Is that what you would do?

209
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,278
Yes.

210
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Really?

211
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,517
Yes.

212
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,606
Everything's exactly the same.

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,090
You should go home.

214
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,394
What about the Stouffer's meeting?

215
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,754
I'll cancel it.

216
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:08,642
It's not hurting anything.

217
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:15,394
There's life, and there's work.

218
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,956
Hey, I got one. Mohawk Airlines:

219
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,166
when you need
to make it past Jamaica Bay.

220
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,641
How about "American:
pioneering vertical flight"?

221
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,509
Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper would
like to see you.

222
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,520
I spoke with Hank Lamont
over at Mohawk.

223
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,395
How are they doing over there?

224
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,479
He says they can weather it out.

225
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:59,333
I always get the feeling that man opens
his front door and money comes in.

226
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,782
Always cleaned me out.

227
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,683
Best poker player
in the South Pacific.

228
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,948
Duck, tell Don here
about your phone call.

229
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,020
Well, I put in a call
to check in with Shel Keneally

230
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,711
over at American Airlines.

231
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,081
He used to run International.
We're old pals.

232
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:14,792
He picked up the phone?
What's going on over there?

233
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,396
Shel says it's bedlam.

234
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,959
Anyway, he was quite clear
about the fact that they're going

235
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,772
to want to make changes
if they want the dust to settle fast.

236
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,204
- What does that mean?
- It means

237
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:27,388
they'll be looking for a new image

238
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,115
and thus a new agency.

239
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:36,581
What's it been, four, three hours
since the plane went down?

240
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,397
You'll have to forgive me
for not looking at a bunch

241
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,734
of bodies in Jamaica Bay
and seeing the opportunity.

242
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,396
Adding a few hours
or a day or a week

243
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:44,905
doesn't make this any more
of an opportunity.

244
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,990
- We already have an airline.
- We don't have American.

245
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,072
That's right. We have the one
whose planes didn't just

246
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,528
fall out of the sky.

247
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,698
That's good.

248
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,747
I'm sorry. Is there an issue?

249
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,166
$1 million. $7 million.

250
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,146
Am I missing something?

251
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,146
Did you sign American during
this phone call?

252
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:02,197
No, but Shel made it very clear
that if we can get rid of our conflict

253
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,757
he'd love to hear our ideas.
It's a serious foothold.

254
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,261
A foothold. I'd do anything
for a foothold.

255
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,319
This is how it works.

256
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:12,403
We got a regional airline
so we'd have a shot at a big one.

257
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,128
I know how you had it in your head.

258
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,997
The president of American Airlines
sees a Mohawk ad, falls in love,

259
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,697
and says "Get me that guy."

260
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:21,442
Well, I'm sorry it didn't
play out that way.

261
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:22,578
Easy.

262
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,062
We have a good client

263
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,772
who trusts us, who likes our work,

264
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,800
who pays their bills on time.

265
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,457
They don't deserve
to be thrown out the door

266
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:38,145
for a wink from American.

267
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,612
I can't believe this.

268
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,235
Anything else?

269
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,240
He'll be fine.

270
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:03,596
I'll need to cancel
my reservations to Sarasota

271
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:07,227
and, of course,
Andrew's return flight.

272
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:09,740
But I...

273
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:13,322
- I can't possibly expect...
- I'm sure that's taken care of.

274
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,372
Dunham's taking care of all that.
Bud's on the phone with him right now.

275
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,831
I'm sure he'll forget something.

276
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,656
There's no way

277
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,762
that he can remember everything.

278
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,136
Bud's very good
with things like this.

279
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:30,051
Is he aware there is no way
to have a funeral without the remains?

280
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,512
What's the difference?

281
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,881
You're right.

282
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,980
There's just so much to do.

283
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,728
What is that?

284
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,983
- What?
- That.

285
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,130
That.

286
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:51,073
What is that?

287
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,619
Take it. I want you to have it.

288
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,655
He was such a fine man,

289
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,055
so well-mannered, civic.

290
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,366
My father admired him.

291
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,952
What a nice thing to say.

292
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:12,553
I like to offer a nice
bouquet of thoughts.

293
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,727
Did you take care of everything?

294
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:26,108
They do this all the time.

295
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,151
What?

296
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,170
I took care of it.

297
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,610
Give me another one of those,
a big one.

298
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,931
Dunham had some unpleasant news.

299
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:39,372
Dad was insolvent, broke.

300
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,332
Is there enough for a funeral?

301
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,003
As if the idea of a will
never crossed your mind?

302
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:49,130
- We weren't going to get that.
- You weren't.

303
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,176
What about her money?

304
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:55,742
The Dykeman Trust isn't
as solid as one would hope.

305
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,970
A lot of loans were taken
out by the president...

306
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,850
and recipient... Daddy.

307
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,478
Really? For what?

308
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,638
I asked Dunham
if there was a woman.

309
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:07,758
He said no.

310
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,944
It's all oysters, travel,
and club memberships.

311
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,634
Does she know?

312
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:16,492
You want to tell her? Go ahead.

313
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,874
Everything's been taken care of.

314
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,195
Boys.

315
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,176
Father called you salt and pepper.

316
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,808
That's beautiful, Dot.

317
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:46,362
Hi, Daddy.

318
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,914
I made you a ham sandwich.

319
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:54,060
What is this?

320
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,540
Carlton and Francine are
coming over for cards.

321
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,826
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?

322
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:05,353
We haven't done it
since before Christmas.

323
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:07,728
And they keep inviting us,
and we never go.

324
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:10,163
- Can I play cards?
- I want to play.

325
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,291
I'm going to lie down for a minute.

326
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,352
I have the chenille bedspread on.

327
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,341
Pull it back or they'll
see the marks on your face

328
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,137
and know you were sleeping.

329
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,670
You can say hello to everyone,
then it's off to bed.

330
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,608
Muddled. That means smash it.

331
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,886
It'll be nicer on the second one.

332
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,674
You did a wonderful job on mine.
Thank you.

333
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,970
Go take Mommy
and Francine's orders.

334
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,537
Bobby, that is your last one.

335
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,725
All right, come on, go. Watch TV.

336
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:50,836
They're growing like weeds.

337
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:52,757
That's true.

338
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,417
We have the Caruthers girl
over to baby-sit already.

339
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:57,087
Can you believe that?

340
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,666
- I don't think we know her.
- You'd remember.

341
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,536
Goes to Immaculate Heart.

342
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:06,164
I've been out of high school
a long time, but, honestly,

343
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,270
the way these girls dress,
and those uniforms.

344
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:13,909
- Carlton.
- What?

345
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,853
I'm enjoying this story so far,

346
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,989
but I have a feeling it's not going
to end well.

347
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:23,618
I think that Francine
brings her in to torture me.

348
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,980
I mean, everything I do
rubs her the wrong way.

349
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:28,999
I got rid of the apartment
in the city.

350
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,912
I'm taking her to Nassau.

351
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,402
There was a pie
cooling in the windowsill,

352
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:36,840
and I'm not even
supposed to smell it.

353
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,594
- It's Darkness at Noon.
- What do you want to hear?

354
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,185
Now, come on. Don't be like that.

355
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,596
Two Tom Collins.

356
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,535
Okay, you don't smash
the cherry on that.

357
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,213
Just plop it in at the end.

358
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,149
Try to keep it in
the top of the glass.

359
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,269
Gin.

360
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:14,401
<i>Oil issues showed
some signs of life today</i>

361
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:16,526
<i>when the Department
of the Treasury announced plans</i>

362
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:18,902
<i>to ease import quotas
on residual oil.</i>

363
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:22,296
<i>By the end of trading today,
Texaco added 1/4, Shell...</i>

364
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,345
Oh, good, you didn't wait.

365
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:26,465
We couldn't. It's late.

366
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:27,585
Work.

367
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:30,402
Your hair looks nice.

368
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:34,096
It does, and she fought
with Mr. Pierre every minute of it.

369
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,398
Monsieur.

370
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,761
He's got some funny ideas.

371
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:42,206
- You want something to eat?
- No, thank you. I already ate.

372
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,179
Connie Griffin was in her yard,
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.

373
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,161
- She saw the whole thing.
- Can you imagine?

374
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:54,150
WLR said there were sharks
eating the victims.

375
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,044
That's worth reporting.

376
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:57,715
You want toast?

377
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,279
Mama, I already ate.

378
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,954
You say you'll come to dinner,
and you already ate?

379
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,234
I came because I wanted to see you.

380
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:06,722
We never see you.

381
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,633
I'm here. Right now.

382
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:14,187
Such a pretty face.

383
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,694
Gladys Rhine was
asking for you at church.

384
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,281
Babe saw your brassiere
ads in the newspaper.

385
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:27,868
You should see poor Donny.
His skin is horrible.

386
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:29,336
Clearasil.

387
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:31,579
- He's beyond that.
- It's a shame.

388
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,191
He's a handsome boy.

389
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,183
Lots of people was
asking me about you.

390
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:42,090
Doesn't mean the same thing
to me that it means to you.

391
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:46,720
I think your father would like it
if you lit a candle for him.

392
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,534
I pray for you.

393
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,959
You know she lies and tells people
you're out of town on business.

394
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,490
She has some made-up church
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,

395
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,528
where you go to mass
with a friend of hers.

396
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,254
No one asked her to lie.

397
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,187
She's not gonna be here fover.

398
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,422
Would it kill you to go?

399
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:21,940
I don't want to.

400
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:24,968
And I'm capable of
making my own decisions.

401
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,967
Really?

402
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,761
State of New York didn't think so.
The doctors didn't think so.

403
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,588
- Did you bring the vacuum?
- Yes.

404
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,900
- Did you empty the bag?
- Yes.

405
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,572
How do you let her get away
with making a bid of 150?

406
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,242
She usually overbids.
How was I supposed to know?

407
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,119
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.

408
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,819
I hear it's gonna be
a row of apartments

409
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,448
all up Cedar Lane.

410
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:00,018
No more cedars.

411
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,128
No parking around the school.

412
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,256
You know, I could've had
that property for a song?

413
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,506
A song and a half, tops.

414
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:11,034
I thought he was crazy,
but there you go.

415
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:19,696
I'm sure we have something else
to talk about.

416
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,399
Did you hear about that jetliner?

417
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,000
Terrible. It's terrible.

418
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:27,946
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland.

419
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:31,616
Now I can't. I have to take the train.
Nine hours.

420
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,452
You have got to be kidding.

421
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:36,499
Sorry.

422
00:25:39,228 --> 00:25:40,315
I love the train.

423
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,127
You do, too.

424
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,376
Bobby.

425
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,076
Go back to bed.

426
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:52,012
I'm scared. I heard something.

427
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,431
Everything's great. Go back to bed.

428
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,331
Bobby.

429
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,482
Come on. Do what your mother says.

430
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:10,945
When I was a child, I would've been
way more afraid of my father

431
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:12,240
than of going to sleep.

432
00:26:12,603 --> 00:26:14,451
I hated going to sleep
when I was a kid.

433
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,526
But I bet you did when
you were told.

434
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:19,494
With a stack of comics
and a flashlight.

435
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:21,829
I don't care what they do
when they're up there,

436
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,501
I just like a few hours of quiet.

437
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:25,503
Ernie tests my patience.

438
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,410
Said they saw a ghost.

439
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,830
They were scared.

440
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,722
He's a little liar.

441
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,808
He is?

442
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:44,029
He drew the most amazing picture
of George Washington the other day.

443
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,564
His teacher was so impressed,

444
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:49,485
- she put it up in the hallway.
- It really looked like him.

445
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,029
Well, obviously.

446
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:52,878
Because he brought it home,

447
00:26:52,998 --> 00:26:55,395
and I noticed the exact same image
of Washington

448
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,610
on the cover of one of his books.

449
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:58,995
He had traced it.

450
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,443
What happened?

451
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:02,831
He brought a book to school
so he could trace it?

452
00:27:03,062 --> 00:27:05,554
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they had it there.

453
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,503
I mean, the point is,
it was dishonest.

454
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:10,881
My whole art department
is run on tracing paper.

455
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,152
Why reinvent the wheel?

456
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,976
I've got the rest.

457
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,432
I don't care about tracing.

458
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:23,812
What about all that praise he accepted
for something he didn't do?

459
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,563
Well, the book says
they start fibbing at this age.

460
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:30,102
Want to see if they can
make it come true.

461
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,654
I Don't need a book to know
what little boys do.

462
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:40,476
You have anything you want me
to take back to the library?

463
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,190
Anything you want me to pick up?

464
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,929
No. I have to renew
The Agony and the Ecstasy.

465
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:48,549
It's taking forever.

466
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,818
I should go.
I have to work tomorrow.

467
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:52,096
Busy bee.

468
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,587
Aren't you going to say good night?

469
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,712
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

470
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:37,775
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's
trying to stop them

471
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:40,158
from putting parking meters
at Depot Plaza.

472
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,320
Apparently, she got chummy with
some administrator at the high school.

473
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,668
Big, fat fellow.

474
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,563
Carlton's put on a few.

475
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,567
I think it's nice he's filled out.
It shows he's happy.

476
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,575
I wouldn't say that.

477
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:57,882
Why not?

478
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,784
Did he say something?
What did he say?

479
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,618
He didn't say anything.

480
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,664
He should be happy.

481
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,124
Okay, maybe he is.

482
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,012
He should be happy and grateful,

483
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:13,045
and showering Francine with love
after what he put her through.

484
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:14,473
Look, Bets,

485
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:16,971
I'm not going to fight.

486
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:21,265
I'll say whatever you
think I should say,

487
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,431
but I'm not going
to fight with you.

488
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,218
What, sweetheart?

489
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:21,326
You laughed. What's funny?

490
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:23,491
I just...

491
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,057
I was just thinking

492
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:28,528
that the last conversation
I had with him,

493
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:31,876
we were arguing about
whether Barney Kellogg bred

494
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,003
Boston terriers or French bulldogs.

495
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,879
I'm sorry you were arguing.

496
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:41,728
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.

497
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,757
The labored breathing.

498
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,872
He said they were French bulldogs.

499
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:49,851
I said they were Boston terriers.

500
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:52,591
He was angry about it.

501
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:56,983
Peter, neither of you
knew it was the last time.

502
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:01,682
"Fighting about facts,"
my mother calls it.

503
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,470
We do it all the time.

504
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:07,452
Argue over something that's actually
one thing or another.

505
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:11,995
What do Barney's dogs look like?

506
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,117
Just beige.

507
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:15,166
Kind of like pugs,

508
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,684
but with big ears.

509
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:19,723
Those are French bulldogs.

510
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:22,011
Really?

511
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:31,752
When I woke up, I felt
fine for a minute.

512
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:35,856
Then I rembered.

513
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,858
You should be thinking
about the good times.

514
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,309
Right.

515
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,115
So they go out a third time,

516
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:49,327
and now the restaurant's
even worse... Indian food.

517
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,368
But she really likes him.

518
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:53,875
I told you he worked
for City Hall, for the Mayor.

519
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,127
- So, what happened?
- I need three copies.

520
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,558
One goes to Mr. Robinson,
one to Mr. Fairbanks,

521
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,068
and one to Mr. Smith.

522
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:01,690
The strange one.

523
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,277
- That doesn't narrow it down.
- Thank you.

524
00:32:05,196 --> 00:32:06,261
Mr. Kinsey.

525
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,261
Is something wrong?

526
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,235
I'm avoiding you.

527
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,742
Or haven't you noticed that
after three days?

528
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:16,690
Are you worried
about the typewriter?

529
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,688
I'm not going to tell anyone.

530
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:21,818
Although you were so brazen,
you don't deserve clemency.

531
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,189
What did you say to Sheila?

532
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:27,655
- Who?
- Sheila.

533
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:31,202
- My girlfriend.
- Describe her to me.

534
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,203
Very funny.

535
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:35,039
I know what's first on the list.

536
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,938
Oh, my God. I knew you were
a lot of things...

537
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,293
I'm not a phony.

538
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:42,271
You're so proud.

539
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:44,515
It's so obvious why
you're seeing her.

540
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:46,443
A supermarket checkout girl?

541
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,291
Conversation must be stimulating.

542
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,805
Lettuce costs a nickel.

543
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,141
What a relief. You're just jealous.

544
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,181
Because you're the one
who got away?

545
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:56,101
You,

546
00:32:56,737 --> 00:33:00,729
out there in your poor-little-rich-boy
apartment in Newark or wherever.

547
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:04,686
Walking around with your pipe
and your beard,

548
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,990
falling in love with that girl just
to show how interesting you are.

549
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:13,369
Go ahead. What part is wrong?

550
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:30,942
Pete?

551
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,348
Duck. Come in.

552
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:37,598
Where's the girl?

553
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:41,161
She's supposed to tell me
if she goes anywhere.

554
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:48,112
When my old man died,
I went on a hell of a bender.

555
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,244
You heard about that.

556
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,493
I had to read about it
in the Times.

557
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,199
I wish you felt that you
could talk to me about it.

558
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,623
You should be able to.
We're practically family here.

559
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,316
Oh, I don't know, Duck.

560
00:34:04,872 --> 00:34:06,089
There's not a lot to say.

561
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:08,049
No. Of course not.

562
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,991
Your old man was
in advertising, right?

563
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,306
Boston.

564
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,059
Used to talk about the'20s
like we're idiots.

565
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,025
My father wasn't.

566
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:23,268
Of course, it turns out

567
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,175
I really didn't know
anything about him

568
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,235
except that he did not
like advertising.

569
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:28,880
Ah, that's his style.

570
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:32,865
I'm sure he was proud of you.
Some people have trouble saying it.

571
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,780
Yes.

572
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:36,994
That was a problem for him.

573
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:39,515
What's not to be proud of?

574
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:41,388
You pay attention. You're hungry.

575
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:44,252
Most of the time you know
what you're doing. I've noticed that.

576
00:34:46,338 --> 00:34:47,887
I appreciate that.

577
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:54,224
Now, I don't want you to think
I'm being insensitive,

578
00:34:54,865 --> 00:34:56,723
but we're going after
American Airlines.

579
00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:00,953
Well, it's...

580
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,062
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

581
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:09,017
I'm meeting at the University Club
with Shel Keneally.

582
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:11,565
Tonight, actually.
Get everything rolling.

583
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,002
If anything, I'd like you on board.

584
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,617
I want you leading
the way on this thing.

585
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:22,491
I think I am uncomfortable.

586
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,261
I don't think I should do that.

587
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:30,150
It just happened.

588
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,809
I haven't even cried yet.

589
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:41,082
Of course.

590
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:44,705
It was inappropriate.

591
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:53,230
I'm sorry for your loss.

592
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:14,437
Can you come in here with
the papers I asked for?

593
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:22,594
Sweetheart.

594
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:24,486
You mind?

595
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:30,426
Need you to set a meeting.

596
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:32,151
A quiet place, but public.

597
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:36,062
Have a heart-to-heart
with Henry Lamont.

598
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:39,496
- Why would I do that?
- Because we're cutting him loose.

599
00:36:40,112 --> 00:36:42,858
Duck's having a meeting with Shel
Keneally from American Airlines tonight.

600
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:45,081
He's letting them know
that Mohawk is over.

601
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,263
And that gets us a pitch?

602
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:49,798
It sends a signal that
we're serious.

603
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,988
And that we're willing to do
whatever it takes.

604
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:53,254
He has nothing.

605
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,364
And this is more of it.
It's desperate.

606
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:58,302
Come on. You should be salivating to
rip these guys away from DDB.

607
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,284
And even if we don't
win this account, we're going

608
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:04,392
to be on a list in the New York Times
of big boys pitching for this business.

609
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:05,797
We have an airline.

610
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:09,319
What kind of company
are we going to be?

611
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:11,899
The kind where everyone
has a summer house?

612
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,629
I can't believe I look like an idiot
for wanting to be loyal to these people.

613
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,993
Take off your dress.
You get a chance at American Airlines,

614
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,200
you take it.

615
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:23,043
End of discussion.

616
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:44,424
Hildy, can you get my wife
on the phone?

617
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,550
Of course.

618
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:48,175
Forget it.

619
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,208
Don. Do you have a minute?

620
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:12,627
What do you want, Campbell?

621
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,049
I just was...

622
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:18,415
- I don't know.
- It's not a good time.

623
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:28,489
If you want, you can leave
him a note. People do that.

624
00:38:29,614 --> 00:38:30,414
No.

625
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:32,784
Thank you.

626
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,850
Good night, Joan.

627
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,687
Did you see who did this?

628
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:14,796
No.

629
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:18,619
I never would have guessed
you were in your 30s.

630
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:21,904
People should not bring
their personal problems into the office.

631
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,156
I agree.

632
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:27,535
Is it so hard to just leave everything
at the door and just do your job?

633
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,620
I look forward to it.

634
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,884
They can't stand it.

635
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,676
They'll drag you into
the garbage out there.

636
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:38,773
They just want you to be
as miserable as they are.

637
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,323
I say let them have it.

638
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,691
How are you, Don?

639
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:07,255
Henry.

640
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,906
Sit down. Can I get you anything?

641
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,511
You know, I'm glad you
picked this place.

642
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:15,916
It remds me of Pearl Harbor.

643
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,461
For many reasons.

644
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:25,426
Do you think you're not
going to have to say it?

645
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:32,016
Sterling Cooper has decided to end
its relationship with Mohawk Airlines.

646
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,905
Sterling Cooper.

647
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:36,694
I'm sorry.

648
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,606
It wasn't my decision.

649
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:43,836
You know, when we came in there, they
all said Sterling Cooper is Don Draper.

650
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:45,321
That's what you get.

651
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,346
That talk you gave me
about us growing together.

652
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:54,511
You said Sterling Cooper
didn't need a big airline.

653
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:57,079
You were going to make us
a big airline.

654
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:04,423
I wish things hadn't
worked out this way.

655
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,554
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.

656
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:14,183
You fooled me.

657
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,559
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed
with firing our head of ops.

658
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:31,182
So this agency change, well,

659
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,953
that's going to be a process.

660
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,705
And to be part of that process?

661
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:39,166
- Listen, we're here talking, right?
- Of course.

662
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:41,763
But it's hard for me to leave here
comfortable unless I know what

663
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,017
your objections are.

664
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,267
We're a few steps away
from objections.

665
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:47,141
We're just sticking
a toe in the water.

666
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:49,219
Well, we're not. We jumped in.

667
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:54,823
Pete.

668
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:58,931
It's good to see you.

669
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:02,260
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.

670
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:05,316
I don't think he's our best.
I think he's the best.

671
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,385
- Pleased to meet you.
- You as well.

672
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,508
I was just telling
my buddy Shel here

673
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:19,890
how we've really cleared
the way to be in this.

674
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:22,369
I was telling Duck here

675
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:25,418
we don't know where we are yet.

676
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,990
I Don't think you're aware
of the level of commitment

677
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,612
and enthusiasm for this project
at Sterling Cooper.

678
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:33,596
It's true.

679
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:35,704
We've got writers bucking the gate.

680
00:42:35,824 --> 00:42:39,332
I've already got a stack of ideas on
my desk that I think you'd love to see.

681
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:47,210
We understand how delicate
the process of rebuilding

682
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,903
the public's confidence will be.

683
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:51,614
Not just the public.
Our stockholders.

684
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:54,836
Well, I want you to know that,

685
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:57,204
should you decide
to bring us your business,

686
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,174
there will be someone
on your account

687
00:42:59,294 --> 00:43:01,793
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

688
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:09,048
My father was on that plane.

689
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:13,762
My goodness.

690
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:19,078
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yes. Well...

691
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:22,325
it's a horrible thing.

692
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,481
Hopefully, something good
will come of it.

693
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:28,776
That is something I will pass on.

694
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,014
Shall we grab a bite?
I put our name in.

695
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:23,663
I'm not your waitress,
but are you all set here?

696
00:44:28,259 --> 00:44:31,347
- Excuse me?
- You've been sitting alone a long time.

697
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,340
Can I get you a menu?

698
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,662
I don't think so.

699
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:40,844
I have to drop this off,

700
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,733
but I can swing back
around on the way out.

701
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:49,517
Not tonight.
