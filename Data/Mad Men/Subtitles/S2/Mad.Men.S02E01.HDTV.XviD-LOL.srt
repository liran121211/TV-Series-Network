00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:32,485
Mad Men 2x1
<i>For Those Who Think Young.</i>

2
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,007
<i>Come on, everybody! Clap your hands!
Ah, you're lookin'good!</i>

3
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,977
<i>I'm gonna sing my song.
It won't take long.</i>

4
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:51,278
<i>We're gonna do the twist,
and it goes like this.</i>

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,033
<i>Come on, let's twist again</i>

6
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,663
<i>Like we did last summer.</i>

7
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,739
<i>Yeah, let's twist again.</i>

8
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,357
<i>Like we did last year.</i>

9
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,669
<i>Do you remember when</i>

10
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:08,085
<i>things were really hummin'?</i>

12
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:11,228
<i>Yeah, let's twist again.</i>

13
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,772
<i>Twistin' time is here Hee,</i>

14
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:19,992
<i>around and around. And up
and down we go again</i>

15
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:24,337
<i>Oh, baby, make me know you love me so</i>

16
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:28,174
<i>again and then twist again...</i>

17
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:30,898
Sit up straight.

18
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,249
Heels down. Lock your hands.

19
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,442
Good girl.

20
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:44,129
There we go.

21
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,756
Now, if you can step over here.

22
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,017
- You're a big one.
- Thank you, Lilly.

23
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,137
Have a seat.

24
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:08,648
So, Mr. Draper, you haven't had
a physical in quite some time.

25
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,979
I eat a lot of apples.

26
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:13,985
What is it with you boys?

27
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:17,465
Why does it take an insurance physical
to get you in here?

28
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:32,388
What's the number?

29
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:35,487
Because that will mean
something to you?

30
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:39,036
It's 160 over 100,
which is high for boys our age.

31
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,384
Tell me about your parents.
Living or deceased?

32
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,979
- Dead. Both.
- Ages?

33
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:48,540
My dad was 41, 42.
He died in an accident,

34
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,139
and my mother died in childbirth.

35
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,159
She was 22, I think.

36
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:56,971
How many drinks do you have a day?
Wine, cocktails, beer.

37
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:59,606
Everything depends on the day.

38
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,853
Days of plenty being...

39
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:03,974
Three.

40
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:07,360
You're a high-powered businessman
with a high-tension job.

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,180
I'm trying to help you here.

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,203
Five.

43
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,925
And two packs a day,
but you're cutting down.

44
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:13,845
Yes.

45
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,063
All right.

46
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,830
Any changes in the last year?

47
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,286
- What do you mean?
- In your health.

48
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,042
How do you feel when you
wake up in the morning?

49
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,539
How do you feel?

50
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,168
You live too hard,
and not just at the office.

51
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,487
It'll hit you all at once.

52
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,827
Nope. No, I've been

53
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,383
I've been good.

54
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:41,333
All right, I'm gonna write you
some resurpine to bring that down

55
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,935
and some Phenobarbital
to help you relax.

56
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:48,642
You're 36 years old.
You need to take this seriously.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,562
Buy a boat.

58
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,744
Breathe in.

59
00:03:56,697 --> 00:04:00,131
So I wait for Becky to go play,
and I look in her pencil case,

60
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,641
and there's almost 20 dimes.
She stopped eating lunch.

61
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:05,708
I hate the dishonesty.

62
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,209
You should be glad
she watches what she eats.

63
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,378
That's the truth.
She is slimming down.

64
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,362
Good morning, ladies.

65
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,117
You want to get off right here?

66
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,689
- You can go right to your car.
- Non.

67
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,185
He's a prisoner of war.

68
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,232
Because he can't ride.

69
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,771
A man that age doesn't
suddenly take this up.

70
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,904
He's 25.

71
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:32,243
Did he tell you that?

72
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,518
I think so.

73
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,180
He talks to me.

74
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:38,405
He's engaged.
There's no point in being aloof.

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,610
I wouldn't know what to talk about.

76
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,344
Aren't you funny?

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,150
Are you scandalized?

78
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:46,516
No.

79
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:48,249
If you must know,

80
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,681
we talk about you
and how Gertie has a crush on you.

81
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,391
She's a sadist.

82
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,660
I'll see you Saturday.

83
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,385
Don't you hate getting
manurenure in that?

84
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:02,136
Little children.
What's the difference?

85
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:15,250
Look, Miss,
just tell me where you want it.

86
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,988
Okay, take out
the lockers and use that wall.

87
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:21,616
The break room?
Don't take away the break room.

88
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:25,995
I'm not taking away anything. Believe
me, this machine is a gift to you girls.

89
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,949
Happy Valentine's, girls.

90
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,690
How are you gonna wear
that around your neck?

91
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,670
It's much bigger than they said it was.
I think it needs an office.

92
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,068
Aw, come on.

93
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,776
We're already doubling up.
Don't do that.

94
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,883
My roommate works at Ernst & Ernst.

95
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:42,428
She did her
birthday party invitations on this.

96
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:44,847
- On colored paper.
- I told you, Miss,

97
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,468
I'll try as many places as you want.

98
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,173
Maybe we should leave it here
for the time being.

99
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,839
I don't care. I'm doing this.

100
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,683
If you think that if you start eating,
we're all gonna join you,

101
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,324
you're wrong.

102
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,296
Look, Don's not one
to stand on ceremony.

103
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,866
He's not gonna care.

104
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,715
I made it.
I knew Draper would be late.

105
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:21,226
I have some crackers in my desk.

106
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,915
So, burning the midnight oil.

107
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,143
S'all right.

108
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:28,470
Hope the words are
good 'cause he ain't got any artwork.

109
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,437
You didn't have time to give it to art?
You want to start living here?

110
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:37,233
I'm supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil
by 12:30 every day. I was promised.

111
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:40,236
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.
I'm sure you can have a drink.

112
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,613
It's an unspoken agreement.

113
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,343
I got you, Freddie.

114
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,014
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?

115
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,926
I don't know. We have artwork.

116
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:58,662
Peggy, go see if we
can expect Don today.

117
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,375
That's a good idea.
Draper's not going to yell at her.

118
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,644
You want to be alone with that?

119
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,185
I'm telling you, Draper knocked her up.

120
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:15,394
She goes away for a couple of months,
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,

121
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:16,738
comes back with a job.

122
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,312
Don's been screwing me
for the last three years.

123
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,782
I've got nothing.

124
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,453
What's everybody laughing at?

125
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,950
Oh, the great debate wages on about
Peggy Olsen's charmed career.

126
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,483
Fat farm.

127
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,108
I thought we had verification.

128
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:36,689
Do you have any idea when
you'll be expecting Mr. Draper?

129
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,438
Um, I was expecting him
at the beginning of work today,

130
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,108
but then he called
and said he'd be late.

131
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,388
He said he was going to the movies.
Pinocchio.

132
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,222
Thank you.

133
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,185
Are you insinuating something?

134
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:00,817
I wasn't doing anything, I don't think.

135
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:03,403
Well, I believe that.

136
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,842
I want you to imagine,
when you talk about Mr. Draper,

137
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,161
that he's standing right behind you,

138
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,165
and think about that
whenever you speak of him.

139
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:15,331
- Are you going to tell on me?
- I didn't know. What did I do?

140
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:19,685
- Do you know where Mr. Draper is?
- No, I don't. I think he was joking.

141
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:21,629
Lois,

142
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,351
do you know where Mr. Draper is?

143
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,113
He's out.

144
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,820
Thank you, Lois.

145
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,790
How is it?

146
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,452
He wrote some of it here.

147
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:06,336
Some of it on 23rd Street,
some place they tore down.

148
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,053
Makes you feel better
about sitting in a bar at lunch.

149
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:13,223
Makes you feel like
you're getting something done.

150
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,683
It's all about getting things done.

151
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,611
Is it good?

152
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,926
I don't think you'd like it.

153
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,327
You wanted to see me?

154
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,865
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.

155
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,497
On my way out. Anything else?

156
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,458
I'm taking Mona to Lutce.

157
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,544
- Let me hear what the living are up to.
- You love her.

158
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,048
- What happened to the Jewish doctor?
- He's not Jewish.

159
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,717
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.
Is he still a doctor?

160
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:52,512
You sound like a little girl.
What do you care?

161
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,131
I wish you every happiness.

162
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,143
I'm well aware this is vicarious.
I already said that.

163
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:01,665
I already know
what day he's going to ask me.

164
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,186
Huh. Does he know that?

165
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,275
Because I have a feeling
there's a penalty for passing that date.

166
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:08,023
He knows.

167
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,333
Mr. Phillips here to see you.

168
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:14,969
Send him in.

169
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,675
Joan.

170
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,285
- Did you girls get my candy?
- yes. It was appreciated

171
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,212
and yet unappreciated.

172
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:24,794
Anything else?

173
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,904
No, thank you, that'll be all.

174
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,078
Got a second?

175
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,931
Nothing good ever started
with that sentence.

176
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,501
It's not that.
It's Martinson's Coffee.

177
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,001
I'm excited about
the possibility of that happening,

178
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,187
and, as you recall, Martinson's Coffee
has a unique problem.

179
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,092
Good. We like that.

180
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,947
Well, that's just it.

181
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:50,171
No one under
25 drinks coffee anymore. Just Pepsi.

182
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:54,739
- They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.
- For those who think young.

183
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,687
Which is why I was disappointed
to see Don put Fred Rumsen on this.

184
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,792
So Freddie doesn't drink coffee.

185
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,937
He doesn't wear a bra, either.
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.

186
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,328
It's frustrating not to have
young people around here.

187
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,711
We're a young country.
The President has a baby.

188
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:10,794
Have you been out there?
It's rotten with kids.

189
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,586
And the cologne they wear.

190
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,981
Real kids. 25. Even less.

191
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:18,195
Maybe one of those teams.
The writer and the artist together.

192
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,822
Clients keep bringing it up.

193
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:22,435
Talk to Don about it.
Just for Martinson's Coffee alone.

194
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,808
Can't you talk to Don about it?

195
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,914
I thought this was
the way things were done here.

196
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,650
Didn't you tell me you were
a bridge between accounts and Don?

197
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,320
Doesn't sound like me.

198
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,680
Look, Don has talent.

199
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,868
You know how to deal
with that, don't you?

200
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,905
Just assume that he knows
as much about business as you do,

201
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,996
but inside there's a child
who likes getting his way.

202
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,290
He's not my first creative director.

203
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,168
This is about a sales reality
and not personal territory.

204
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,522
It's what the clients are asking for,
and we need to have it.

205
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,992
What's the best way to make it happen?

206
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,759
- Mr. Draper.
- Any calls?

207
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,859
Yes, and there was your 12:00
in the conference room.

208
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:06,913
Of course.

209
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,908
Well, girls can say whatever they want.
They want the chocolates.

210
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:20,333
Right, Peggy?

211
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,787
- Of course they do.
- I don't do anything.

212
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:26,999
- Keeps 'em off balance.
- Hey, chief.

213
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,211
Sorry we're late.

214
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,586
I think the little ones need to eat.

215
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,958
What do we have? Dale, wake up.

216
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:37,941
I could just go.

217
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:39,824
Or Kinsey.

218
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,709
You want to go first?

219
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,016
Peggy.

220
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,267
I just wrote copy for Dale.

221
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,943
Well, this is kind of the gist,
because I was...

222
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,266
Well, we were...

223
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,839
It just kept changing course.

224
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,203
"Mohawk Airlines.
There's a new chief in the sky."

225
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:07,081
And I thought, following that,

226
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:11,272
"Most routes to Boston. Circle
the wagons, we've got it surrounded."

227
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:14,773
And there'd be wagons
around a dot that says "Boston."

228
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:16,882
I can almost picture it. Sal.

229
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:18,759
It's the first time I'm hearing it, too.

230
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,876
So it's about an airline
that's flown by Indians?

231
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,877
Maybe a plane with some arrows
stuck in the cargo door. That's funny.

232
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,893
That's what gets
people's attention now, right?

233
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:32,116
There has to be advertising for people
who don't have a sense of humor.

234
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:34,720
- I understand.
- What else you got?

235
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:37,319
Several more Indian puns.

236
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,802
Stop writing for other writers.

237
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,560
Luxury, service.

238
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,167
A lot of people are
afraid of turbulence,

239
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,555
- so it's dead calm.
- Look how level those drinks are.

240
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:54,962
"Wherever Mohawk takes us."

241
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:58,090
- Or, "You'll love getting there."
- What's outside that window?

242
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:00,580
- Fluffy clouds.
- Research.

243
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,940
I get on a plane,
I don't care where I'm going.

244
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,792
I just want to see the city
disappearing behind me.

245
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,456
So we could take the clouds
out of there and put in a city.

246
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,126
The Chrysler Building.

247
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,237
That Indian...

248
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:17,994
It's not about the majestic beauty
of the Mohawk Nation.

249
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,651
It's about adventure.

250
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,473
Could be a... pirate.

251
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,929
Could be a knight in shining armor.
It could be...

252
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,695
a conquistador getting off of a boat.

253
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,090
It's about a fantastical people who

254
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,360
are taking you someplace
where you've never been.

255
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,426
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

256
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:52,848
We could dress the stew as Pocahontas.

257
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,482
With the cheekbones.

258
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,336
How's his wife going to feel about that?

259
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:59,406
Air travel's too expensive
to waste on your wife.

260
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:02,650
You want to get on a plane to feel
alive. You want to get on a plane...

261
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,240
to see just the hint of a
woman's thigh because her skirt is just

262
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,210
is just this much too short.

263
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,105
Friday?

264
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,460
Tomorrow.

265
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,372
What does that mean?

266
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,588
It means you want to go
somewhere, go up her skirt.

267
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:22,119
That's the impression I got.

268
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,539
Karla, Bobby's turning blue out there.

269
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,549
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?

270
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,589
They made everybody
give one to everybody else.

271
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:36,423
That defeats the purpose.

272
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:37,873
They had a party.

273
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,059
I see. Fruit punch?

274
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:43,320
- I'm making this for Daddy.
- That's beautiful.

275
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,490
I'll see that he gets it.

276
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,062
- Mommy, can I do it?
- Okay.

277
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,876
I want to go riding with you.

278
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,933
- You can't.
- Well, why?

279
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,070
Well, for one thing, it's too dangerous.

280
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,671
No, it's not.

281
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,378
Do you rember what happened to
the little girl in Gone With the Wind?

282
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:08,037
You are taking a bath tonight.

283
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,403
They say once you start drinking
alone, you're an alcoholic.

284
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,482
I'm really trying to avoid that.

285
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,000
So I guess I'm helping both of us.

286
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,155
Cooper wants younger people.

287
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,741
- For what purpose?
- Martinson's Coffee.

288
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:32,725
Last time Freddie Rumsen
had a cup of coffee,

289
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:36,195
it was one of five being
poured down his throat by a cop.

290
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:41,052
Well, young campaigns don't necessarily
come from young people.

291
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,292
The clients like it.

292
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:45,162
The clients like
the thrill of young talent.

293
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,791
So what am I supposed to do?

294
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,561
Dangle a Pepsi out the window
and see if I can hook a stroller?

295
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,460
I have some candidates.

296
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:57,811
- This smells like accounts to me.
- I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.

297
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:01,051
He had no idea he was signing
his own death warrant.

298
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:05,021
- You want younger people than that?
- What do you want me to say?

299
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:06,987
Tell Duck...

300
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,730
clients don't understand.

301
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:13,714
Their success is related
to standing out, not fitting in.

302
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,126
It's a fad.

303
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,237
Paint him a picture.
Uh, something like

304
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,399
one wants to be
the needle in the haystack,

305
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,451
- not a haystack.
- Donald,

306
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:30,346
isn't it possible that the recently
weaned have some unique perspective?

307
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,930
Joy, enthusiasm.

308
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:37,019
You're talking as if they're
some fresh version of us. They're not.

309
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,890
Young people don't know anything,

310
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,188
especially that they're young.

311
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:43,511
Huh.

312
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:47,607
Well, let me set this in a more
appealing context for you.

313
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,133
Prove him wrong.

314
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,582
Happy Valentine's Day.

315
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:18,186
- I love this place.
- I know.

316
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,513
- So what are we doing?
- Don't worry.

317
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:23,483
We will be out of here
before the singer starts.

318
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:25,678
Juanita?

319
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:28,680
Betsy Hofstadt.

320
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,734
Look at you.

321
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,643
This is so nice. Don, believe it
or not, you two have met.

322
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,679
I don't think we have, Bets. Don Draper.

323
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,583
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure.

324
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:42,267
Juanita was one of my roommates
when I lived on the West Side.

325
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:45,071
- We were models together.
- In that horrible apartment.

326
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:49,483
- Do you live in the city?
- Well, I do. Curtis is from Detroit.

327
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,813
Automobiles.

328
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:52,674
How are you?

329
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,440
Um, I work as a decorator.

330
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:56,907
How exciting.

331
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,144
I have a little girl and boy.

332
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:00,866
Of course you do.

333
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,914
It looks like everything's going well.

334
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,754
My God, that stone.

335
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,664
Oh, that was a gift.

336
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,216
Well, give me your phone number.
Tell me how I can reach you.

337
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,691
Does anyone have a business card?

338
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,655
I do.

339
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,895
I would love a nice long lunch.

340
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,252
So nice to see you.

341
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,290
That is not who I thought
she would end up with.

342
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,916
I don't think it's permanent.

343
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,363
Can you imagine
still dating at our age?

344
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,822
She's a party girl, Bets.

345
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,299
Really?

346
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,703
Really.

347
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,365
And how do you know that?

348
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,315
Well?

349
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,001
How stupid do you think I am?

350
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,022
Juanita Carson.

351
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,660
Should I get another one here?
What are we doing?

352
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,621
How does room service sound?

353
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,251
Oh, Don.

354
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,206
I came prepared.

355
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,567
I suppose people get lonely.

356
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:15,021
And it's Valentine's Day.

357
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,504
Be mine for $100.

358
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:20,620
How much is it, do you think?

359
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:26,237
I told her I wanted to have
hundreds of babies with you.

360
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:53,957
Hello, lovely.

361
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:02,876
Happy Valentine's.

362
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,149
- That's so sweet.
- I got your little note.

363
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:08,800
Well, Hildy did.

364
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,565
Be careful about
just putting things in my bag.

365
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:17,246
Come on, open them. I want one.

366
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:29,807
The round ones are conut.

367
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:32,791
Should've got the kind
where they put that chart in the box.

368
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,921
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.

369
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:36,603
She's expecting.

370
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,600
That's impossible.
Carey didn't tell me anything.

371
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:44,673
That's because he doesn't know.
She's going to surprise him tonight.

372
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:49,768
I just got so distracted.

373
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,638
Dinner's not for an hour.

374
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,189
I'm through with my past love Tweety.

375
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:00,722
There's no reason that's bad for us.

376
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:06,804
I saw this dumpy woman on Second
Avenue by the Hungarian market.

377
00:24:06,924 --> 00:24:10,702
And she had her daughter pushing
a stroller with a little boy in it.

378
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:13,089
And she was round.

379
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,302
She was expecting another.

380
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,004
She was just...

381
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,728
buying fruit like it was any other day.

382
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:21,598
The daughter was pregnant.

383
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:24,760
The mother.

384
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,499
It's this big club
they're all in together.

385
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:30,945
Even her.

386
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,355
Well.

387
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:35,808
Rest assured.

388
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,310
She doesn't have what you have.

389
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,472
Jennifer Crane does.

390
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:44,721
Do you really believe that?

391
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:48,492
I guess not.

392
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:23,431
Hold on.

393
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,517
What's wrong?

394
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,655
Don. It's okay.

395
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:38,241
We've got all night.

396
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,075
I wish you'd... just tell me what to do.

397
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:25,642
We drank too much, you know.
I don't even know where I am.

398
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:32,039
You should eat something.

399
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,905
Hello. Yes. This is Mr. Draper in, uh,

400
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:45,551
room 804.

401
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:48,892
Yes. Can you send up some, uh...

402
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:53,003
some vichyssoise
and a BLT on white toast?

403
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:55,197
No. Shrimp cocktail. Two of them.

404
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:57,685
Scratch that.
Two shrimp cocktails, please.

405
00:26:57,805 --> 00:26:58,955
Wait a minute.

406
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:03,976
Hello.

407
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:08,544
Yeah. Do you have anything special?
Anything out of season?

408
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:10,465
<i>... so when you find a room like this.</i>

409
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,553
<i>This piano was designed
by Franklin Roosevelt...</i>

410
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:16,846
Oh, leave that.

411
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,380
How about this? I want a half

412
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,322
avocado filled with
crabmeat and a rare BFT filet.

413
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,267
Two place settings.

414
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:30,592
<i>And if it's an American company
that you can help, I like to do that.</i>

415
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,179
<i>If it's not, just as long
as it's the best.</i>

416
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,607
<i>I rather love this hall.</i>

417
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:39,389
<i>It has all the colors one thinks
of when one thinks of the White House</i>

418
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:41,999
<i>red and white and blue and gold.</i>

419
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,836
<i>It's through this door
that all the heads of state come.</i>

420
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,501
<i>And this is
where the President meets them.</i>

421
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,917
<i>And here is where the Marine band plays.</i>

422
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,282
<i>They have "Ruffles and Flourishes,"</i>

423
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:53,997
<i>and "Hail to the Chief."</i>

424
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:56,155
<i>And then there's a receiving line,</i>

425
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,498
<i>and then everyone goes in to dinner
here in the State Dining Room.</i>

426
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:00,698
Where's her husband?

427
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:03,403
<i>Even now, it's not set up for that many.</i>

428
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:07,182
<i>- Are there many state dinners?
- Yes, there are.</i>

429
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,232
<i>Uh, there were almost
two a month last year.</i>

430
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:12,407
<i>This room's interesting</i>

431
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:16,264
<i>because it has the most architectural
unity of any room in the White House.</i>

432
00:28:16,384 --> 00:28:18,408
<i>It's really all 1902,</i>

433
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:22,264
<i>when Theodore Roosevelt
did the great resoration</i>

434
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,452
<i>with McKim, Mead and White.</i>

435
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:28,005
<i>Which of these pieces
have historical associations?</i>

436
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:30,088
<i>Oh, there are quite a few.</i>

437
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,758
You have to see this.

438
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,632
<i>That's Nellie Custis'sofa...</i>

439
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:34,924
No, I don't.

440
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:38,148
<i>... George Washington's granddaughter.
I feel so strongly</i>

441
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:41,430
<i>that the White House
should have this fine a collection.</i>

442
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:43,553
<i>It's so important, the setting in</i>

443
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:46,436
<i>which the presidency
is presented to the world.</i>

444
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,997
<i>- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.</i>

445
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:51,320
<i>But I'm going to find out.</i>

446
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:53,985
<i>And now a word from our sponsor.</i>

447
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:00,575
Their armoire?

448
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,160
I've seen them in Connecticut.

449
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,412
But they're copies.
You know, Jackie has a real one.

450
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,929
In the White House? I think so.

451
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,583
She seemed nervous.

452
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:12,337
Even when she saw Jack at the end.
It's like they were playing house.

453
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:16,477
That's chocolate ice cream. Or blood.

454
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,776
I couldn't throw it away.

455
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,173
It's French.

456
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:25,225
We'll call it chocolate ice cream,
and I'll work on it.

457
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:29,736
Well, I'm sorry we missed it.
No time for television.

458
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:32,182
Stop rubbing it in.

459
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:35,193
Really. A room at the Savoy?
That takes thought.

460
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,965
Your night sounded very romantic.

461
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,791
I would describe it as...
delightfully disappointing.

462
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:45,952
There was a time when he overdid it, but
I'll take dull and know where I stand.

463
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:47,138
I agree.

464
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:50,458
What?

465
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:59,530
I ran into this old friend.
Juanita Carson.

466
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,401
We were models together. Roommates.

467
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:06,023
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.
She didn't look cheap.

468
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,468
Except for this 2- carat stone.

469
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:10,350
But she wasn't with a date.

470
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,461
She was with a companion.

471
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,476
I don't understand.

472
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:18,650
Don agreed with me.
He was an old man.

473
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,068
She's a call girl.

474
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:23,806
Really?

475
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,554
Butterfield 8?

476
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,692
- I wonder what that's like.
- I don't know.

477
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:33,187
New York... Manhattan... is expensive.
We forget that.

478
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,724
I used to look at people
in restaurants with envy.

479
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,577
Don gave me a fur coat.

480
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:43,198
If prostitution is Don showing up
with a fur coat, sign me up.

481
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,094
I don't think it's like that.

482
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:47,983
I just keep picturing Juanita
at 22 years old.

483
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,115
We shared a room.

484
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,289
Talked in the dark.

485
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,064
I know we wanted the same things.

486
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,237
When I was 22, whenever
I was really low on money,

487
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,258
I would call my father and let him know
that I was going to Havana.

488
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:04,237
And he would, without fail,

489
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:07,463
send $25 in cash in the mail.

490
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:10,663
He wanted you to have a good time.

491
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:13,187
No. He's a degenerate gambler.

492
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:16,294
And it would always come with
a list of instructions of how to bet it.

493
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,865
- You're kidding me.
- No. And he never won

494
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,535
because I never went.

495
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,041
That's criminal.

496
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,445
What's wrong with the conference room?

497
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:37,148
Why don't we go to my office?
Plenty of room.

498
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:38,525
Braggart.

499
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:40,957
Nope. We're sitting here.

500
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:43,071
I'm trying to figure something out.

501
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:46,441
So, Pops. We should celebrate
your soon-to-be-fat wife.

502
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,812
Aren't you happy?

503
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:52,082
Well, sure. I mean,
it's gonna be a lot of headaches.

504
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,694
Things are gonna change. But come on.

505
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,327
He's really meeting with them.

506
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:03,925
Why are they doing this?

507
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:07,053
I guess you haven't been privy
to some of Duck's scoutmaster

508
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:09,097
talks about how we need
younger creative.

509
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,683
Who said that? Did he say that?

510
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:12,893
A few times.

511
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,099
Wonderful.

512
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:17,662
Look. We're in the same boat.
I'm sure he'll turn his sights on us.

513
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,858
No one's been promoted
in Accounts since he came in.

514
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:22,201
I can't believe Donald
would listen to Duck.

515
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:25,091
- Well, maybe Duck made him.
- Nobody makes Draper do anything.

516
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:28,286
Let me tell you. Don Draper
has a rope coiled under his desk

517
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:30,656
and it's looped around Duck's neck.

518
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:34,440
And Duck's gonna run around
and run around, and then one day...

519
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:39,794
There's a meeting?
Nobody told me there was a meeting.

520
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:41,621
Can we change venues?

521
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,026
So...

522
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,320
you have a lot of thoughts.

523
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,712
How old are you?

524
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:55,689
25. 24.

525
00:32:56,345 --> 00:33:00,508
But that resume, that's really just
two years. 18 months, without a doubt.

526
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:03,109
Right. You're experienced, I gather.

527
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:05,244
Are you married?

528
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:07,712
That's, uh, why we're
on the the purpose.

529
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:10,312
He's right. We haven't settled down yet.

530
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:14,454
So, again, you both did everything

531
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:17,044
together. And yet, you get paid more.

532
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:21,336
Well, I have a writing background.
Short fiction. And I'm a citizen.

533
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:23,880
But you contribute words.

534
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,741
Uh, only when it's a distance.

535
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:33,896
I'm gonna ask you a question

536
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,185
that was always asked of me
when I was on job interviews.

537
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:39,722
That is divine, man.

538
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,196
Have you ever been fired?

539
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:48,148
I believe you that other people
have them in the hallways.

540
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,077
I just don't know
if that's right for us.

541
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:52,037
I mean, this is
an environment for clients.

542
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,446
We don't want to appear
to be bursting at the seams.

543
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,744
Uh, Lois?

544
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,395
May I speak with you?

545
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,100
Theresa said there
was an incident yesterday.

546
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:08,383
You were crying in the break room,
which I have specifically forbidden.

547
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:11,010
- I'm sorry, but Peggy...
- Miss Olsen.

548
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,376
She yelled at me.

549
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:16,782
Why would she do that?

550
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,060
I'm good at my job.

551
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,866
The next time that you come to complain

552
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:23,940
I wasn't complaining.
You wanted to talk to me.

553
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,185
This is why I don't allow crying
in the break room. It erodes morale.

554
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:30,255
There's a place to do that,
like your apartment.

555
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:31,614
It came over me.

556
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,325
And I would correct
your attitude towards Miss Olsen.

557
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:36,498
- It's unbecoming.
- Yes, Joan.

558
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,082
Do we like this in the hallway?

559
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:46,236
I think it looks good now,
but I think it will become messy.

560
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:47,733
I agree.

561
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,525
Looks good.

562
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:58,558
By the way, it has Julian Koenig's
fingerprints all over it.

563
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:01,175
His Master's Voice. Also not mine.

564
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:05,181
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.
- Smitty. Kurt.

565
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,735
We have the same last name.
We don't want people to mix us up.

566
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,986
Must happen all the time.
You two share an office?

567
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:11,701
Works best that way.

568
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:15,094
Look at this. Gentlemen,
your reputations precede you.

569
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,695
Duck Phillips, head of Account Services.

570
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,370
I get a distinct impression.

571
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,980
- Pardon?
- We'd...

572
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:23,583
rather people not know we were here.

573
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,831
If it gets out we're meeting...

574
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:27,949
- Of course not.
- Yes. Right.

575
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:29,019
Good-bye.

576
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,983
- I'll let him know she called.
- Okay.

577
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:36,130
I like the direction you're taking.

578
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,096
Good.

579
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,975
So now that I've given you
your babies and your Xerox machine,

580
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,281
should I throw in a couple of elephants?

581
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:45,265
I don't want there to be any excuse when
you can't bring in Martinson's Coffee.

582
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:46,835
Don't get worked up.

583
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,558
You know, there are
other ways to think of things

584
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,847
than the way you think of them.

585
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:02,121
The testimonials. I was thinking
we could get younger girls.

586
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,755
Sixth graders. It would mean
different publications.

587
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,953
- Do they need Clearasil that early?
- Doesn't matter.

588
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:07,919
Doesn't.

589
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,830
I guess we could try that.

590
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,091
Two more. From DVB.

591
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,373
Even younger.

592
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:17,595
Just assume that everyone on the list
you handed Roger is coming in.

593
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:18,718
You're an idiot.

594
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,185
- I don't understand that. I'm only 22.
- You don't count.

595
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:25,500
We've got to get him out of here.
Come on daddy.

596
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:28,146
How often do you get to celebrate
getting some girl pregnant?

597
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:29,957
Campbell, you're buying.

598
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,022
We still have to show
Mohawk to Mr. Draper.

599
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,892
- Dale's not here.
- Mr. Draper doesn't care.

600
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:40,514
Kids.

601
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,270
What's the big deal?

602
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,751
Do you want to have kids?

603
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:47,309
Eventually.

604
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:49,284
Exactly.

605
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:02,433
Mr. Romano, Miss Olsen.

606
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,705
Send them in.

607
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:10,598
- Where are we?
- You tell us.

608
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:15,188
"Where are you going?"

609
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:19,823
Are you gonna underline the "you"?

610
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,441
For half the people, it will be,
"Where are you going?"

611
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,192
I also had "Come away with us."

612
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,047
Where the hell's Dale?

613
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,010
He's sick.

614
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,134
I don't know. Sure.

615
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:37,506
Fine.

616
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,701
It's exactly what we talked about.

617
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,126
It's obvious.

618
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:43,803
I'm uninvolved.

619
00:37:57,737 --> 00:37:59,089
What about that?

620
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,477
- I think it's sentimental.
- Peggy.

621
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:06,484
No, she's right.

622
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:11,154
Just because it has sentiment
doesn't make it sentimental.

623
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:13,753
We're talking about businessmen.

624
00:38:14,078 --> 00:38:16,695
Right. Businessmen
who like short skirts.

625
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,563
Sex sells.

626
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,782
Says who?

627
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:32,177
Just so you know,
the people who talk that way think that

628
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:34,617
monkeys can do this.

629
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:38,361
And they take all this monkey crap
and just stick it in a briefcase,

630
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,720
completely unaware

631
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,502
that their success depends
on something more than their shoe shine.

632
00:38:53,328 --> 00:38:54,778
You are the product.

633
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:57,797
You, feeling something.

634
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:00,097
That's what sells.

635
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:01,938
Not them.

636
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,020
Not sex.

637
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:10,844
They can't do what we do.

638
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,455
And they hate us for it.

639
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:23,414
"Welcome back, Daddy"?

640
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,229
Is that a question?

641
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,868
"What did you bring me, Daddy?"

642
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,313
You can put that in your book.

643
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,667
What is going on?

644
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:34,668
He's gonna take it to Leon in Actuarial?

645
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:37,785
His stomach's so fat,
it's now resting on his desk.

646
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,758
Gotta feed that big brain.

647
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:42,192
He's a deal breaker.

648
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:43,969
I'm a closer.

649
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:48,428
That Cecelia?
Sits outside Fred Talbot's office?

650
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:51,234
You made that happen?
Silver tongue.

651
00:40:55,707 --> 00:40:57,457
I got her three stingers.

652
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,200
She's a little girl.

653
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,746
Well, you have to give'em an excuse.
That's what I always say.

654
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:05,423
She had those panties that said
"Wednesday." They were soaked through.

655
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:06,666
I love that.

656
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:09,595
Once the engine went running,
she wouldn't stop.

657
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:12,574
- She's so straight.
- Oh, you think that.

658
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,477
Take your hat off.

659
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,553
Is there a problem?

660
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,805
Damn it.

661
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:13,981
Everything okay?

662
00:42:14,727 --> 00:42:17,281
- Uh, you know anything about cars?
- No.

663
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:19,494
Um...

664
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,585
C Can you tell them
at the Esso to send a tow truck?

665
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:23,598
Okay.

666
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:36,783
Hey, Karla.

667
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:38,068
Hi.

668
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:39,765
Hi, B.

669
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:41,334
Hey, Daddy.

670
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,379
How was your day, Mr. Draper?

671
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:47,085
I am tired.

672
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:48,588
Where's Mrs. Draper?

673
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,975
She just went to get Sally from ballet.

674
00:42:52,661 --> 00:42:54,511
Want a ride to the station?

675
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:57,020
No. I'm all right.

676
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:59,455
It's a nice night out.
I enjoy the fresh air.

677
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:02,162
- Good night, Bobby.
- Good night.

678
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:03,621
Good night.

679
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,626
I don't like it.

680
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:20,075
Here. Give it to me.

681
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:30,530
I just know when the smoke
starts to come out, I have to stop.

682
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,899
That's true.

683
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:36,033
I got a fan belt on the truck.
I could put it in for $9.00.

684
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,351
Hold on.

685
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:04,344
I have $3.00 and change.

686
00:44:04,885 --> 00:44:07,413
I could put it on account,
send you a bill.

687
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:11,083
I I don't want my husband
knowing about this. It's a new car.

688
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:13,214
He doesn't like the way I drive.

689
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:15,884
Well, that's got nothing
to do with this.

690
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:22,810
Well, it would mean
the world to me.

691
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,490
I don't know. You know, the...
the belt's $2.55.

692
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,801
So there's nothing you can do
for a damsel in distress.

693
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,990
Are we bargaing here?

694
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:42,335
Well...

695
00:44:43,276 --> 00:44:44,822
Yes... yes, we are.

696
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:48,693
I could say no, couldn't I?

697
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,851
That would be a terrible disappointment.

698
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,356
It would be, wouldn't it?

699
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:27,027
It's not that complicated.

700
00:45:27,147 --> 00:45:28,556
That's a relief.

701
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,420
Well...

702
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,416
that'll do it.

703
00:45:57,857 --> 00:45:59,426
Have a good night now.

704
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:00,957
I will.

705
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:10,037
<i>- Hi, dear. How'd the shopping go?
- Oh, wonderful, marvelous.</i>

706
00:46:10,157 --> 00:46:12,731
<i>- Look at all the stamps I got.
- Is there someplace you could buy...</i>

707
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:14,015
Polly!

708
00:46:14,135 --> 00:46:16,485
<i>Save you all the trouble of shopping.</i>

709
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,057
- I'm here, too.
- Hi, Daddy.

710
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:23,259
<i>... could be 80 or 90 stamps right here.</i>

711
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:25,503
Bobby conked out. Where were you?

712
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:27,162
Mommy was late.

713
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:31,125
I got stuck talking to
Marilyn Keckner in the parking lot.

714
00:46:32,194 --> 00:46:33,517
Well, I was here.

715
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:36,243
- Did you eat something?
- I did.

716
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,950
Come on. Show me
what you learned in ballet.

717
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:05,993
<i>Now I am quietly waiting for
the catastrophe of my personality</i>

718
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:07,804
<i>to seem beautiful again,</i>

719
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:10,526
<i>and interesting and modern.</i>

720
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:20,934
<i>The country is gray and...</i>

721
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,582
<i>brown and white and trees.</i>

722
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,674
<i>Snows and skies of laughter
are always diminishing.</i>

723
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:32,847
<i>Less funny, not just darker.</i>

724
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:34,563
<i>Not just gray.</i>

725
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:39,831
<i>It may be the coldest day of the year.</i>

726
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,375
<i>What does he think of that?</i>

727
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:44,333
<i>I mean...</i>

728
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:45,968
<i>what do I?</i>

729
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,171
<i>And if I do...</i>

730
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:53,085
<i>perhaps I am myself again</i>
