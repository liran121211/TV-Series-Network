00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,005
<i>Previously on</i> Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:04,286
I want to have you on the beach

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,317
This is ma father-in-law.

4
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,449
Do you know how's hard I work
to get this account?

5
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:10,972
You have to do something.
He needs a spanking.

6
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,823
He knows he did something wrong.

7
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:15,561
I sure as hell wouldn't want a kid
here watching this donny brook.

8
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,673
I really do want a baby

9
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,274
I'd like you to meet Jane
the new girl.

10
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:22,534
Good morning.

11
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:25,612
Is there an issue? One million dollars,
7 million dollars.

12
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:27,637
Easy.

13
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:29,831
Don't do that.

14
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,193
Mad Men 2x6
<i>Maidenform</i>

15
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,158
<i>I dreamed I stopped them in their
tracks in my MaidenForm bra.</i>

16
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,911
You're asking
if I've seen these before?

17
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,709
They've been running this
for ten years.

18
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,255
- The Playtex people are jealous.
- They shouldn't be.

19
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,754
Maidenform is a dream,
but Playtex is a bra.

20
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,066
I've never seen
either brand go wrong.

22
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:09,570
I had four of these up in my dorm.
I didn't even know what advertising was.

23
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,593
Why now? Sales are strong.

24
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,879
Someone has a wife with an opinion.

25
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,994
They would like to do
what Maidenform is doing,

26
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,582
not what we're doing.

27
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,476
Why? Then they both
have the same campaign.

28
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,503
I love how they don't
need a diagram.

29
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:25,315
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?
And if so, why?

30
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,630
I do,

31
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:31,128
and I agree with
the 95 women we surveyed

32
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:32,898
about how well it fits.

33
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,137
I find they both open easily.

34
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,661
I like a happy client, although
you'd think someone would be able

35
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,426
to talk them out of jumping
onto a bandwagon as solid as this.

36
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,124
Maybe they want us
to raise the bar.

37
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,819
Why, because their share
of the market keeps increasing?

38
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,755
You see them every four months.
Why not throw them a bone?

39
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,323
Let them see they're paying
for creative.

40
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,999
Just wrinkle it a little.

41
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,427
I went to sleep in my bra,
and I thought I was so-and-so.

42
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,055
Thank you for that.

43
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,874
Just for fun, let's say
we're looking for new,

44
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,321
and by new I mean old Maidenform.

45
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,727
Peggy, you dig in around
Playtex's unique benefits.

46
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,690
- Just the man to do it.
- What do I tell them?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,258
Tell them you couldn't
get ahold of me.

48
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,325
Mr. Phillips, your ex...

49
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:18,989
your wife...

50
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,455
- Mrs. Phillips...
- Pauline. I see her.

51
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,788
Thank you, Joyce.

52
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,186
Hey, fella.

53
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:31,623
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,913
Someone made you
smell like a girl, yes.

55
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,349
Come on. This way.

56
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,068
Hey, slugger.

57
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,188
Hey, Dad.

58
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,643
- Precious.
- Hi, Daddy.

59
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:47,856
- You look well.
- So do you.

60
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,108
How's your mother?

61
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,694
Worse. She's very erratic.

62
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:57,115
Did you see the guy up at Brigham
that Bob Levinson recommended?

63
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,637
I Don't want to talk
about this right now.

64
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,111
I can't leave right now.

65
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,816
I wish you would have told me
that you were going to be early.

66
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,747
I know you're not good
in the afternoons.

67
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,542
That's not true anymore.
You know that.

68
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,749
Okay.

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,129
You two have a good time.

70
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,192
I will try and call you
from Nana's.

71
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:18,006
- Did you get a suite?
- They opened up the room next door.

72
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,678
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.

73
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:21,692
'Cause he's a good boy.

74
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,819
We're going to have
a wonderful time on the town.

75
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,568
I got tickets
for A Funny Thing Happened.

76
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:30,298
- We saw it.
- Not from these seats.

77
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:31,614
I should go.

78
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,880
So you'll have to wait
a little while in my office,

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,882
do your studies,
work up an appetite.

80
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,630
It's Memorial Day.
All I have is German vocabulary.

81
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,800
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.

82
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,465
Nice dog.

83
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,320
Who are these?

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,569
This is my son Mark
and my daughter Patricia.

85
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,944
A handsome family.

86
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:54,464
And this is Chauncey.

87
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,965
I hope he can't smell cat on me.

88
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,759
Freddie and I work together.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,428
Can I bend your ear a minute?

90
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,551
Spit it out, Freddie.

91
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,891
We're going to need
another box of brassieres.

92
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,354
Yes. Of course.

93
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,731
Enjoy your holiday.

94
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,853
Come on, Chauncey.

95
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,576
Her skin cleared up,
but she still looks unhappy.

96
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:25,244
- She's a cheerleader.
- For who, the University of Dour?

97
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:30,875
- Does she have any cute friends?
- These are the top three.

98
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,694
I'm sorry, but compared to
the kids on American Bandstand,

99
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:34,920
they look miserable.

100
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:37,500
- Those kids are drunk.
- Really?

101
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,841
I Don't know.

102
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,301
What about the idea of them
going on a date?

103
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,652
Mr. and Mrs. Fresh Face.

104
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:48,767
We could do multiple panels in print,
but it would really translate to TV.

105
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:49,769
How?

106
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,315
Like a contest?

107
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,042
No, it's a story.

108
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,776
Anticipation as they get ready,
fixing their hair

109
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,302
to look perfect.

110
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,884
Their skin,
it's not even on their mind.

111
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,156
They're two kids
who used to have a problem.

112
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,535
Thanks, Clearasil.

113
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:08,496
Maybe, but it's prom night,

114
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:10,572
and it ends with him at the door

115
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,606
and her and a corsage,

116
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,460
the first moment
they see each other.

117
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,087
- And Dad with the Brownie?
- Clearasil...

118
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,364
and some kind of line.

119
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:24,095
What about "Thanks, Clearasil"?

120
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,222
I need to think about it.

121
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,384
I can work with that.

122
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,445
You want to run this
by your father-in-law?

123
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:31,565
Eventually.

124
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,565
Have a nice holiday.

125
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,790
- So how the hell are you, Don?
- Good. How are you, Krapp?

126
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:55,585
Glad to be in shorts.
You Don't play?

127
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,253
I Don't mind watching.

128
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:59,446
Whenever it's this hot,
I think about that summer

129
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,341
they executed the Rosenbergs.
It was always about to rain.

130
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,181
I remember that.
We were still in Manhattan.

131
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,368
I Don't miss it.

132
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:09,182
We get them to close Sing Sing,
we'll be in Shangri-la.

133
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:11,027
I keep having this dream

134
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,382
that there's a power failure
and the gates open.

135
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,152
Hadn't thought of that.

136
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,321
Let's change the subject.

137
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,195
Eventually, I just said, "Fine."

138
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,071
"If Lem Jones Associates
is falling apart,"

139
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,736
"maybe it's time to move on."

140
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,756
I hadn't heard about that.

141
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,907
I guess you PR men
have the best PR.

142
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,827
I went to Rogers & Cowan
and left them burning behind me.

143
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,066
What happened over there?

144
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,948
I was on the team
that took the fall

145
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,088
for the Cuban
Revolutionary Council.

146
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,380
The Bay of Pigs?

147
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:46,446
The CIA hired us to help
them inspire the Cuban people

148
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,429
to a coordinated wave
of sabotage and rebellion.

149
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,475
- You handled that, huh?
- Not as badly as they did.

150
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,574
But I Don't know when Don's
going to be able to get away.

151
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:58,644
High-class problems, my dear.

152
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,399
Marcie, we should say hello
to Chuck and Ham.

153
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,429
I didn't know you belonged here.

154
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,370
I've been coming here
since I was a kid.

155
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,540
We're guests of the Pattersons.

156
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,004
Where's Tara?

157
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,309
Over there, I think.

158
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,045
I haven't seen you riding.

159
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:30,907
I suppose that's true.

160
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:33,111
I know you changed your schedule,

161
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,517
and I'm afraid I had
something to do with that.

162
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,645
No. Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:42,885
All I wanted to say is
please ride when you want.

164
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,483
I'll stay out of your way.

165
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,780
It's very nice to see you.

166
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,283
Arthur, it's okay.

167
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,747
As we used to say in college,

168
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,370
let's be friends.

169
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,137
Good. Because I think
you would have enjoyed

170
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,459
seeing me get nosed
into the trough the other day.

171
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,376
- No.
- Yes.

172
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,252
Mommy! Mommy!

173
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:15,098
- it's nice to see you.
- You as well.

174
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,070
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.

175
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,010
Still, all that vigor disappeared

176
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,863
when he found out he
couldn't get anything done.

177
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,233
It's Versailles.

178
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:31,073
Jackie's smiling all over the world,
he's chasing starlets.

179
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:32,574
Everybody's happy.

180
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,453
- I'm building a bomb shelter.
- Really?

181
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,115
If you see Petra, Don't mention it.

182
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,285
She doesn't want people to know.

183
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,726
Good seeing you, Don.

184
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,053
Let me know
if you need a reference.

185
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:44,211
We'd love to have you here.

186
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,510
If I could have everyone's
attention for a moment.

187
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,284
Please be seated.

188
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,363
It is a tradition

189
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,866
that we have our ribs
and fashion show

190
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:54,680
on this day every year.

191
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:58,613
Well, this is not to dim
our resolute admiration

192
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,302
for the fortitude of those

193
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:03,194
who have so nobly
served our country,

194
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:08,093
many of whom will not be
enjoying ribs this afternoon.

195
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:12,739
If you could please stand,
all servicemen,

196
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:16,661
for a moment
of our insufficient appreciation.

197
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:18,745
Including Lester Aaron.

198
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,666
Lester was a Rough Rider.

199
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,543
Please, heroes, on your feet.

200
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,210
Can you close the door?
You're letting the air out.

201
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,710
- Those look delicious.
- It's not the club,

202
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,126
but at least you know
I washed my hands.

203
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,254
- How are things in the circus?
- Damn serious.

204
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:12,741
What is this?

205
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,354
J&B. The network sent me a case.

206
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,846
This is why I Don't have a TV.

207
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,669
- You want something else?
- He'll suffer through it.

208
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,645
- Do you know where you're summering?
- We were thinking Point O'Woods.

209
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,417
I have to work, though.

210
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,817
Mother's going to
expect you on Fishers.

211
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,480
I see her crossing the widow's walk
with an eye to the sea.

212
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:35,229
I was on the phone
with her the other day,

213
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:37,169
and you were all she talked about.

214
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,359
- Really?
- No. I'm kidding.

215
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,982
I Don't think I know
what's funny about that.

216
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,552
Judy, would you help me
with the corn?

217
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,294
Now, listen. Don't scrimp.
Take a vacation.

218
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:51,730
Don't Trudy's folks have some
incredible vacation spread?

219
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,800
It's not about the money, Bud.

220
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:57,386
I'm very important to the agency.
My absence is felt.

221
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,720
Yes. Well.

222
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,025
Let's see how the Ottomanelli Brothers
treated us.

223
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,858
And here's Annette Fogel ready
for <i>the playa</i>.

224
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,980
That's Spanish
for "beach," gentlemen,

225
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,512
and that's where you'll want to be.

226
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,533
If something sportier
is what you're looking for,

227
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:23,084
- check out...
- I have to go.

228
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,283
Really? You're really going?

229
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,796
I wouldn't think
you'd want to leave this.

230
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,946
People will be working.
I should stop by.

231
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,820
You're going to miss the sparklers.

232
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,946
Call me from the emergency room.

233
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,970
And this delight, Judy Sawyer,

234
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,229
is ready for the beaches
of California,

235
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,763
where she loves to do the Watusi.

236
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Room 301.

237
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:03,208
Hello.

238
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,675
- <i>You're there. Good.</i>
- Yes.

239
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:11,550
But there's been a change of plans.
I'm spending the day with my son.

240
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,003
We're going to the beach.

241
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,425
Your son?

242
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,111
He's 18.

243
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,885
I Don't know why
I never brought him up.

244
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:26,684
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills
for the next ten days.

245
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,194
Los Angeles. That's far away.

246
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,101
<i>No. It's some club in Kentucky.</i>

247
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:33,982
<i>Still far away.</i>

248
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:37,694
I could stay out at the beach,
and you could join.

249
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:40,155
You never saw it.

250
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,656
Don't do that.

251
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,992
What? You never think about it?

252
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,035
No.

253
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,169
I do.

254
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,036
All the time.

255
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:52,455
<i>The car on its side,
your body crushing me.</i>

256
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,685
I Don't know why I think about it.

257
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:56,805
Maybe I do.

258
00:13:58,366 --> 00:13:59,507
I'll call you.

259
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,495
I'd like that.

260
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,497
Morning.

261
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,087
Hello.

262
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:14,047
I ran that "Thanks, Clearasil"
thing by my father-in-law.

263
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:16,122
He loved it.

264
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:17,870
I'm glad.

265
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,516
The libraries were closed yesterday.

266
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:23,078
- What did you do?
- I was working,

267
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,343
and then there was a barbecue.
It was too hot.

268
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,824
It was too hot.

269
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:29,246
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.

270
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,142
It goes along for a while,
and then it takes a turn

271
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,404
and ends up exactly where
you thought it was going.

272
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:35,967
John Wayne shot him.

273
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,109
- Have you seen it yet?
- It's okay. You saved me 50 cents.

274
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm sorry. I hate people who do that.

275
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:47,935
I know you Don't like the line.

276
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,660
Look, it's all about keeping
your father-in-law happy.

277
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,912
I do my job, you do yours.

278
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,143
What's that supposed to mean?

279
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:57,263
Nothing.

280
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,153
Just play with it.

281
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:08,345
- You're still out there in Brooklyn?
- Yes.

282
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,340
- Where again?
- Marine Park?

283
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,965
No, I moved a while ago.

284
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,144
I'm on my second apartment,
in Prospect Park.

285
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,004
East 83rd Street.
It's a ghost town.

286
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,486
But my brother came to my cookout.

287
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:24,563
Who were you with?

288
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,086
My family.

289
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:29,657
Pete, look, I really do
have a lot of work to do.

290
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:30,837
Of course.

291
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,496
Let me know where you land.

292
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,275
- How was your day off?
- Restful.

293
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,176
I went to the beach.

294
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:49,345
Too much, I see.

295
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,463
I got it behind my knees.

296
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,351
I couldn't sit down.

297
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,016
Morning.

298
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,500
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.

299
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:02,348
Has your wife seen that yet?

300
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,652
Do me a favor. Let me
be there when it happens.

301
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:07,280
Is that why you're here?

302
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,032
Concern for my well-being?

303
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:11,324
Here's your cigarette.
Be on your way.

304
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:13,136
But wait. There's more.

305
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,536
You are going to
have lunch with Duck.

306
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,631
Perhaps on a train car

307
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,592
because I want you to sign an
armistice on American Airlines.

308
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,591
- What are you talking about?
- I've been in the meetings.

309
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,405
Errol Flynn is gone,
and so is my taste for swordplay.

310
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,218
You two need to put them away.

311
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,338
I have.

312
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:32,892
I've been married for over 20 years.
I know the difference between a spat

313
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:36,183
and spending a month on the couch.
Don't go to bed angry.

314
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:46,479
Two hot chocolates.

315
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:48,988
I Don't want it.

316
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,491
Sure you do. It's good when it's hot
to drink something hot.

317
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,407
If you continued with the Scouts,
you would have learned that.

318
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,077
Patty, you can use the phone,
but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.

319
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:01,593
Daddy has a morning meeting.

320
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,031
There's a food cart.
It'll be here in 20 minutes.

321
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,801
No scraps for Chauncey.

322
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,968
I have money. I have $150.

323
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,139
- Mark.
- That's good.

324
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,221
How did you get that tidy sum?

325
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,846
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.

326
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,902
And why would he do that?

327
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:21,645
Because he wants us to be happy
when he marries Mom.

328
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,188
We all want you to be happy.

329
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,236
And whatever his intentions,
it's very generous.

330
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,280
He already asked her.

331
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,663
You must have known eventually

332
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,250
that your mother
and I might be starting new lives.

333
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,461
We understand. We Don't care.

334
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,514
It's not easy for her.

335
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:51,513
With you away at St. Paul's now,
she's lost her man of the house.

336
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,413
Franklin Reeve is a good man.

337
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:57,222
Mom's going to stick you
with Chauncey.

338
00:18:57,342 --> 00:18:58,159
What?

339
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,596
We're supposed
to say good-bye to him.

340
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:02,143
She can't make you do that.

341
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:03,604
Dad, he's your dog.

342
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,343
And I've learned
to live without him

343
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,784
so you two kids could
have some consistency.

344
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,254
Frank's allergic.

345
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:24,364
Your mother will be here
in a half an hour.

346
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:37,066
- Where are we?
- We had an interesting idea.

347
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,259
We?

348
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:41,532
Are you on Playtex?

349
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,434
He wants to get
credit for his idea.

350
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:44,895
You sure about that?

351
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,149
We went out the other night,
after the meeting...

352
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,533
you know, a little
extra hours after hours...

353
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:53,345
and I looked around the bar.

354
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,488
- We all did.
- From what I understand,

355
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:59,159
Playtex has an amazing bra,
but it doesn't take you anywhere.

356
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,753
- Well put.
- So I was thinking.

357
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,096
Women right now
already have a fantasy,

358
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,409
and it's not going up the Nile.

359
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,345
It's right here in America.

360
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:10,832
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

361
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:14,154
Every single woman is one of them.
Watch this.

362
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,530
Jackie.

363
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,532
Marilyn.

364
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:24,402
Jackie.

365
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,341
Marilyn...

366
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,148
Marilyn's really a Joan,
not the other way around.

367
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,221
That is an idea

368
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,333
and an impressive presentation.

369
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,452
Well, you always say
it's a 24-hour-a-day job.

370
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,211
Apparently, I've already
signed off on it.

371
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:54,368
I Don't know if all women
are a Jackie or a Marilyn.

372
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,597
Maybe men see them that way.

373
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,067
Bras are for men.

374
00:20:58,187 --> 00:21:00,804
Women want to see themselves
the way men see them.

375
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:03,221
You're a Jackie or a Marilyn...

376
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:06,059
a line and a curve.
Nothing goes better together.

377
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,769
Which do you think I am?

378
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,542
Gertrude Stein.

379
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:14,275
I would say you're more classical,
Hellenic.

380
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:15,735
Irene Dunne.

381
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,194
I love Irene Dunne.

382
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:21,484
Peggy, you're going
to have company on this.

383
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,254
Congratulations, Kinsey.

384
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:25,891
You forced your way
on to an account.

385
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,457
<i>Mr. Phillips is here.</i>

386
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,625
Sorry I'm late.

387
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:32,210
Get back. Out.

388
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:34,487
Who's the new account man?

389
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,631
It's Chauncey. Sorry about that.

390
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,732
Listen, any idea
when I can schedule Playtex?

391
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,924
We're laying track. I think you can
bring the train in tomorrow.

392
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,594
Something new, I hope.

393
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,766
Can I drop some crumbs, at least?

394
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:51,468
Two sides of one woman...
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.

395
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,738
Maybe it's two girls.

396
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,708
But definitely two flavors...

397
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,279
- vanilla and cherry.
- Sounds good.

398
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,675
Don, your girl says
you're free for lunch.

399
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:01,906
She's in charge.

400
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:04,116
Come on, Chauncey.

401
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:05,919
Come on.

402
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:08,955
Thought you all were
listening. Let's go.

403
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,771
What, sweetheart?

404
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,965
I wish you would have told me
you were going to work Tuesday night.

405
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:21,468
If you have something better,
I'll run it by Don.

406
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,781
He already likes that.

407
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,069
Yes, he does.

408
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,181
Isn't that our goal?

409
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:31,423
I'm not saying I had a better idea,
but now I'm not even a part of it.

410
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,613
All I had to do was be in that bar.

411
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,298
Believe me, you didn't
want to be in that bar.

412
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:37,737
The work's done.

413
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,307
Now go write me
some titillating copy.

414
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,936
<i>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

415
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:55,596
Send him in.

416
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,548
Are you coming by to pick me up?

417
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:02,158
No.

418
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:06,231
It's just I wasn't really planning
on coming back after lunch.

419
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,472
Any way we can have
this conversation now?

420
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:09,822
Conversation?

421
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:12,560
Roger told me it was
just a friendly lunch.

422
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,675
I know.

423
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,424
People start giving you things.
They think it's cute.

424
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:21,094
I've got a crate
of that crap somewhere.

425
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:25,677
That's quite a playing field
you have there.

426
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:28,247
I Don't like anything
on it but ashes.

427
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:32,240
I thought maybe your secretary
was better than mine.

428
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,676
Nobody's secretary's
better than yours.

429
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,710
You creative directors.

430
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,862
All I can say is it's been hard
to figure things out around here.

431
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:44,132
18 months in?

432
00:23:45,043 --> 00:23:46,741
We can't be that unusual.

433
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:48,990
I'm doing the job
you hired me to do.

434
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,988
I tell people that Sterling Cooper
is the only place to be.

435
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:54,795
You've been pitching more to me
than you have the clients.

436
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:56,175
What does that mean?

437
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:59,376
It means you've been
selling their ideas to me

438
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,447
more than mine to them.

439
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,115
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I missed duty.

440
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,053
Fell down the steps or something.

441
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,823
My squad leader covered,

442
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,033
but then I confessed to the men.

443
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,300
He laid down
some rifle fire for me,

444
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,491
and I acted like I didn't need it.

445
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,740
That's not the situation
I want to be in here.

446
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,910
So what, you're covering for me?

447
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,384
Who am I in this story?

448
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,898
I'm grateful, Don.

449
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,303
If you hadn't brought me in,
where would I be?

450
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:32,273
Some fifth wheel at McCann?

451
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,602
Look, I did everything I could
for you on American Airlines.

452
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,561
It was a risk worth taking.

453
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,522
People think of us differently.

454
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,587
What do you want me to say?

455
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:44,444
That we're on the same team?
That I love being in your unit?

456
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:46,273
Sarge, I'm scared?

457
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,758
You have an "I told you so," okay?

458
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,685
Can we move forward?

459
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,921
I'm the one who looks bad.

460
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,147
It hasn't hurt the company.

461
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:02,879
Yes. Of course we can.

462
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,925
And I will tell Roger we had lunch.

463
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:09,895
Well. Good, then.

464
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,635
Where did you come from?

465
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,699
You Don't want to know.

466
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:45,362
Wait.

467
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,610
I love it.

468
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:50,428
I'm warm and I'm cold.

469
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:56,422
What time is it?

470
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:03,440
A little after 4.

471
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,526
I have to get ready.

472
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:11,430
- Where are you going?
- My daughter's in a play.

473
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,217
Daughter?

474
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:15,694
Is that everyone?

475
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,867
She's at Sarah Lawrence.

476
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:28,494
How much preparation do you need?

477
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,433
You Don't want me to go.

478
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,905
I took the afternoon off.

479
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:38,031
For me?

480
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,143
You're a lion, aren't you?

481
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,111
Now I know what you like.

482
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:53,766
You can go.

483
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,561
I know I can.

484
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:01,344
Do you want to stay here?

485
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:03,094
Watch TV?

486
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,521
Go through my things?

487
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:10,493
I would never leave you
alone in my place.

488
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:12,794
Yes, you would.

489
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Stay.

490
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:16,656
Relax.

491
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:20,767
Believe me, I'm the same way.

492
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,669
It has to come out somewhere.

493
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,537
I'll get you out in time
for dinner, I promise.

494
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:35,907
What's going on?

495
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,659
- You here to audition?
- No one told me about this.

496
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:44,123
I'm taking pictures.
You can look at the pictures.

497
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,446
- I didn't know you'd want to come.
- Is Paul in there?

498
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,464
A lot of guys are in there.
You can come in if you want.

499
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,135
No. I'm just surprised
because I have an eye for this.

500
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:56,867
Don't worry about Kinsey.

501
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:59,972
I won't let him put anything
together without you.

502
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:01,426
Who's next?

503
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:13,298
Hey, girl.

504
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:16,825
You look lost.

505
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:18,177
Chauncey.

506
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:19,612
Here he is.

507
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:23,246
- I apologize, Chauncey.
- I thought you were a girl.

508
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:25,665
Beautiful dog.
Where have you been hiding him?

509
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,045
I made my wife give him back to me.
Missed him too much.

510
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:31,848
I like dogs.

511
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:35,182
Dogs are better than wives.
Never a problem communicating.

512
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,352
I like having one in the office.

513
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:41,914
Makes us look more easy going,
friendly, you know, to clients.

514
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,617
Maybe I'll bring one in, too.

515
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:46,368
What breed do you have?

516
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:48,038
I Don't have one.

517
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:50,814
I was going to get one
for the office.

518
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,554
I Don't think that's a good idea.

519
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,277
Good night, Campbell.
Come on, Chauncey.

520
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,500
What were you doing
in Sterling Cooper?

521
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,682
There was a casting call for Playtex.

522
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:24,802
Oh, right.

523
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,476
Fellas are calling it
the bra-tions.

524
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,329
That's funny.

525
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,050
You work there?

526
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:33,176
I do.

527
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,101
Want me to find out how it went?

528
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:38,113
I already know. Not well.

529
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:41,154
I find that hard to believe.

530
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,621
They fall in love
with a picture of you,

531
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,992
and then you come in,
and they're disappointed.

532
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,618
But it doesn't make any sense

533
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,988
because all they need is a picture.

534
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:53,497
I didn't bring my camera with me,

535
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:56,467
but I can't imagine
it being better than this.

536
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,309
I Don't know. Maybe I look tired.

537
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:02,803
I just flew back
from working in London.

538
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,677
London?

539
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,026
What's your name?

540
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:13,988
Peter Campbell.

541
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,430
Oh, my. Account executive.

542
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:38,006
I love the taste of Scotch.

543
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,099
Thank you.

544
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,127
Stop. Turn around.

545
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,112
Let me look at you.

546
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,899
When I first saw you,

547
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,229
I thought you were foreign.

548
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:01,169
Really? Is that right?

549
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:04,788
Hold that.

550
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:09,657
I have company.

551
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,926
I'll be right back.

552
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,064
- Who was that?
- My mother.

553
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:37,216
Really?

554
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,786
What, you didn't think
I had a mother?

555
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,148
It's okay.

556
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,022
Hold on.

557
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,926
You want me to fix you something?

558
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,198
What's that?

559
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,397
Cereal.

560
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:22,212
No. That.

561
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,209
Do you like it?

562
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,174
I bought it at the auction.

563
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:29,344
Can I speak to you a minute?

564
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,392
What? What's wrong?

565
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,399
- Where are you going in that?
- Swimming.

566
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:42,314
You asked me if I like it. I Don't.

567
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:44,241
What are you talking about?

568
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,719
I'm talking about
a 15-year-old lifeguard.

569
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,598
I'm talking about
a bunch of tennis pros,

570
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,251
not to mention all those loafing
millionaires taking the summer off.

571
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:53,028
Do you want to be ogled?

572
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:55,218
Everybody bought one
at the auction.

573
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,536
It's desperate.

574
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:02,163
I didn't know that.

575
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,112
I have to go.

576
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:06,650
See you tonight.

577
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,786
Joan, there you are.

578
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,469
Are you aware
that I'm on the Playtex account?

579
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:24,594
- What about it?
- Please tell the girls

580
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,817
I am to be included
in all the memos.

581
00:34:26,979 --> 00:34:29,655
Sure. For a moment there,
I thought you were just another person

582
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:31,363
coming to ask me
about my brassiere.

583
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,901
Why aren't I on the list?

584
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,744
I Don't know what to tell you.
I'm not involved in that.

585
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,598
There's business going on,
and I'm not invited.

586
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,349
I'm a good drinker.

587
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,794
What are you asking me?

588
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:47,718
You know how this office works.

589
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,888
Parts of it.

590
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:53,238
- Forget it.
- I've never had your job.

591
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:55,076
I've never wanted it.

592
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:58,599
You're in their country.
Learn to speak the language.

593
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:02,024
- You Don't talk that way.
- I Don't need to.

594
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:04,238
And honestly,

595
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,926
you've never listened
to a word I've said.

596
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,702
You want to be taken seriously?

597
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:13,155
Stop dressing like a little girl.

598
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,536
Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe.

599
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:22,217
Women have feelings
about these women

600
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,587
because men do.

601
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:26,677
Because we want both,
they want to be both.

602
00:35:27,622 --> 00:35:30,409
It's about how they want
to be seen by us...

603
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:34,218
their husbands, their boyfriends,
their friends' husbands.

604
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:36,763
Here's the idea, very simply.

605
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:38,811
The bra is called the Harlequin.

606
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,765
In fit and form,
it should be your very best.

607
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:44,372
It comes in black and white.

608
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:50,568
Jackie, Marilyn.

609
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:52,653
Same incredible fit,

610
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:55,016
two different women.

611
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:56,949
And the beauty of it is
it's the same woman,

612
00:35:57,394 --> 00:35:58,450
the same model.

613
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:00,456
Look at that. It is.

614
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,142
And even if you Don't notice it,
you still get a bit of an "Aha"

615
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,516
when you read the copy.

616
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:08,250
"Nothing fits both sides of a woman
better than Playtex."

617
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,411
It's a very impressing idea, Don.

618
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,534
I like the girl.

619
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:19,930
So will your customers.
It's a very flattering mirror.

620
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:23,188
This definitely moves you
into Maidenform's neighborhood.

621
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:26,172
But sales have been so good

622
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:28,939
when we talk about
how well our brassieres fit.

623
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:32,106
I Don't know what to say.

624
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:34,903
We were talking in the cab
on the way over.

625
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:38,717
Let Maidenform have
women's imaginations.

626
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:40,992
We'll take their money.

627
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,016
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

628
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,915
I apologize for the goose chase.

629
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:49,486
We're very sorry.

630
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,504
No one else can have
this campaign, right?

631
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:53,760
It's yours.

632
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:56,400
We'll keep it on file for you.

633
00:36:57,377 --> 00:36:58,580
A pleasure.

634
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,950
- Thanks again.
- Thanks for coming in.

635
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,683
That was a waste of inspiration.

636
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:05,635
These people.

637
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:08,148
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

638
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,001
They made up their minds
on the way over.

639
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,462
Why put up a fight?

640
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:14,134
I think we bought
a couple years of security.

641
00:37:14,254 --> 00:37:15,519
If they ever decide
they want to go that way,

642
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,289
they know we can do it.

643
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:21,340
Listen, we would love
to show our appreciation

644
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,286
by entertaing
you gentlemen tonight.

645
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:25,370
And you can put it on our bill.

646
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,682
Make sure Don knows he's invited.

647
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:29,040
Where should we go?

648
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,437
Surprise us.

649
00:37:30,557 --> 00:37:33,079
If we were to take you
to see some girls in their underwear,

650
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,193
would you feel like you're at work?

651
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:36,955
No. That sounds good.

652
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:39,837
Let us clear the decks.
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.

653
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,720
That's on 44th and 8th.

654
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:44,348
We will be there,
and the tab will be open.

655
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm going to go tell Campbell.

656
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,892
Take care.

657
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:51,416
- Good to see you.
- See you there.

658
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,520
Mr. Phillips.

659
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,583
We have artwork
in the evening papers, son,

660
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:13,894
and I don't have them.

661
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:16,255
Someone's supposed
to put them on my desk, Friday or not.

662
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,133
- Should I get some?
- What do you think?

663
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,590
I'll be right back.

664
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:42,147
It's flattering to be able
to keep you interested.

665
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:44,187
Stop talking.

666
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,078
Why Don't you want me to talk?

667
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:12,871
You know you want me to.

668
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:15,096
Do I?

669
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:17,223
You do.

670
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:31,287
Touch me.

671
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:33,225
No.

672
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:43,361
Don't stop torturing me.

673
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,363
I want the full
Don Draper treatment.

674
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:49,601
You're spoiling the mood.

675
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:52,787
I wanted it, and I got it,
and it's better than they said.

676
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,288
What?

677
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,310
Have no fear.

678
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:02,235
You're known as a connoisseur.

679
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:05,257
You have lots of fans.

680
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,801
Are you talking about me?

681
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,311
I wasn't, no.

682
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:12,475
- Well, who was?
- What?

683
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,050
Who?

684
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:20,523
Sarah Tierney at Random House.

685
00:41:25,536 --> 00:41:27,362
I Don't know
who you're talking about.

686
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,776
Stop.

687
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:33,086
This is nobody's
maiden voyage here,

688
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,861
handsome.

689
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,535
You have a reputation.

690
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:42,256
Enjoy it.

691
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,097
Does it make you feel better
to think that I'm like you?

692
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:06,515
My goodness.

693
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,195
Gloves come off.

694
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:18,741
I like this.

695
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,041
You want to blindfold me?

696
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,015
What are you doing?

697
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:29,466
Are you going?

698
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,043
I told you to stop talking.

699
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:48,994
Thank you.

700
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:15,887
People are going to
think you're the mayor.

701
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:32,680
Hey, look, it's Peggy.

702
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:34,947
What are you doing here?

703
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:37,073
I Don't know. I heard
you were celebrating.

704
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:39,367
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Did you now?

705
00:43:39,507 --> 00:43:41,257
Stay for one drink.

706
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:43,799
You're staying all night,
aren't you?

707
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:46,261
I might as well see you now.

708
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,586
Tell me what you want
for Christmas.

709
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:55,843
What do you want for breakfast?

710
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:56,963
Grapefruit.

711
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,339
Hey, Daddy.

712
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:12,837
Hey, you.

713
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:23,593
I'm not going to talk.

714
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:25,808
I Don't want you to cut yourself.

715
00:45:51,117 --> 00:45:52,664
Are you okay, Daddy?

716
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:58,841
You know what, Sally, I think
you better leave me alone.
