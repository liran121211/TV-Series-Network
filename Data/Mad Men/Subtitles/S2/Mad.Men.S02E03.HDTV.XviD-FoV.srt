1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,926
It's smooth, it's brown.

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:08,053
Now, Sinatra drinks it.
Why shouldn't you?

3
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:11,882
This bulging?

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,288
No.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,041
Get somebody to clean up
the loose chips on the bar.

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:16,989
It's messy.

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:19,233
And if I decide I want to spill some
during the bit,

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,552
it's not going to be funny
if there's already some there.

9
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,017
Rolling again.

10
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,801
Rolling. Sound, speed.

11
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:27,751
"Utz are better than nuts"
bar scene, take 6.

12
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:29,699
Action.

13
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,615
Imagine my horror when a night
on the town turned ugly.

14
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,678
This is a nice place
for nice people,

15
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:40,117
and the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

16
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:41,787
What am I, a squirrel?

17
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,381
Well, lucky for him, I bring my own
wherever I go.

18
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,405
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

19
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:51,221
Just you try to stick your face
into a can of nuts.

20
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,340
Take it from a nut.
Utz are better than nuts.

21
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,730
Don't cut. No.
I want to do that again.

22
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:04,768
Roll the camera over that way 5 feet
and come in around the lapels.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,029
Quiet, please.

24
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,712
Still rolling.

25
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,264
Try sticking your face
into a can of nuts.

26
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,618
Stick your face into a can of nuts.

27
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:17,663
Just try and stick
your face into a c...

28
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,254
Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,
watching as the great airship Hindenburg

29
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:27,173
attempts to tie off its mooring mast
and... Oh, my God!

30
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,757
She suddenly burst into flames!

31
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,385
God! Look at the size of it!

32
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:32,947
It's horrible! The humanity!

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,516
Get sitting bull on the phone.
We found the last buffalo.

34
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,479
Get a wider lens, right?
We want to shoot her in cinema fat.

35
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,920
Hey, jimmy, what do you say
we take a little break?

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,357
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

37
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,638
I want to see if Gepetto's
building a fire in there.

38
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,529
That man is an animal.

39
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:53,626
Jesus, Jimmy.

40
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,791
Just for your information,
this guy's laughing over here.

41
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:05,003
Mad Men 2x3
<i>The Benefactor</i>

42
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,152
Are you going right home?

43
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:18,403
No.

44
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,267
I have marketing.

45
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,973
- I have to pick up Don's watch.
- You bought Don a watch?

46
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,849
I got it repaired.
He was bathing the kids with it.

47
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:28,789
I've been looking
for one for Raymond.

48
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,479
- We're coming up on 10, you know.
- 10?

49
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,848
Poor man has to think of something
for the girl who has everything.

50
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,036
Did you make any suggestions?

52
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,606
I do love your car.

54
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,407
That's not romantic.

55
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:43,157
Did you hear the part
where I said 10 years?

56
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,243
I shouldn't be saying that.

57
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,369
He looks like a little boy.

58
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,455
I guess.

59
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,649
He reminds me of monty clift
ina place in the sun,

60
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:00,318
learning how to ride so he can worm
his way into the upper crust.

61
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,155
Somewhere there's a pregnant girl
floating in a lake.

62
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,133
I'm from the south.
There are such people.

63
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,902
I think he needs a different horse.

64
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,156
He's on the worst one we have.

65
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,799
I apologize.

66
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:19,000
I knew it would be a challenge,
or I would have done it myself.

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,745
- Thank you, gertie.
- You have to admit

68
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,398
he is handsome.

69
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,968
He's got that going for him.

70
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:27,931
Shall we?

71
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,562
- I have to get my purse.
- No. You're not going anywhere.

72
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,182
We have to meet her.

73
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,389
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,
this is Tara Montague, my fiancée.

74
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,433
- Sarah Beth Carson.
- Betty Draper.

75
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,476
You must be the ladies
he rides with.

76
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,436
We're among them.

77
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,730
Artie, are you
the rooster around here?

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,541
I think they make fun of me.

79
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:54,279
We don't. That would be cruel.

80
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,030
I've done plenty of things for him.

81
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,877
And I'd love to continue doing so.

82
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,052
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:08,168
She's pretty.

84
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:11,546
- Very pretty.
- Prettier than I expected.

85
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,538
I think she's about right.

86
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:17,634
I spend too much time here.

87
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:19,596
I actually dreamt about him.

88
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:23,141
I think it was him, or a version of him
that could ride.

89
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,525
I'll see you saturday.

90
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:28,100
No. You'll have him
to yourself on saturday.

91
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,231
Becky has a dance recital.

92
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,901
It's so horrible to put girls
that fat in a leotard.

93
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,320
Stop. She'll outgrow it.

94
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:36,778
She did.

95
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:49,038
- Happy thursday, Mr. Crane.
- Thank you.

96
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,658
You've never opened
one of these, have you?

97
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:57,507
Hey, Todd...

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,263
- Yes, Mr. Crane?
- Nothing.

99
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:03,947
Get the door, will you?

100
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:48,611
Damn it.

101
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,711
You in the middle of something?

102
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,072
We're going to the oyster bar.

103
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,280
I'm not hungry.

104
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,917
- Hello.
- good, you are home.

105
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:36,523
<i>Never got any better.</i>

106
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:38,468
I almost threw up
waiting for our elevator

107
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,403
and then just came back
and got undressed.

108
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,155
Ah. Sorry.

109
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:45,447
But aren't you sweet to call
and check up on me.

110
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,433
<i>Harry?</i>

111
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,622
<i>Harry?</i>

112
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,332
What's wrong?

113
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,043
You told me you wanted me
to tell me if I was upset.

114
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,296
- What did I do?
- <i>No, honey.</i>

115
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:00,839
- No, it's nothing.
- <i>You do sound upset.</i>

116
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:03,509
Something is wrong.
Harry, do I want to hear this?

117
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,809
Would you stop? Let me talk?

118
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,389
Okay. Were you fired?

119
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:12,351
I accidentally opened
Ken Cosgrove's paycheck.

120
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:13,653
So?

121
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:16,814
What's he going to care?
Tampering with the U.S. Mail?

122
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:18,440
He makes 300 a week.

123
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,488
What?

124
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,445
That mannequin makes $300 a week?
He's not married.

125
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,723
- <i>We have one on the way.</i>
- I hate this place.

126
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,880
- I should quit.
- That's your response.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,011
The hours you work?
Forget about Kenny.

128
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:35,756
If they have that much money to spend,
they should spend it on you.

129
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,375
You're making that place.

130
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,629
I don't know about that.

131
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,509
What are you worth?

132
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,049
You got in there and ask for it.

133
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,437
<i>Demand it.</i>

134
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:46,636
<i>Be polite,</i>

135
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:48,846
but think about what
you're worth to them.

136
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:49,809
No.

137
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,641
No, I can't do that.

138
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,634
I didn't know this was about
your feeling sorry for yourself.

139
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,228
I'm hanging up.

140
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,752
You know where I can
get a number 10 envelope

141
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,942
with a windowpane and a green stripe
on the side?

142
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,662
No.

143
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,278
I need to lay down.

144
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:06,778
Yeah. Right.

145
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:08,610
Well, uh, feel better.

146
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,791
Do you have a number 10 envelope
with a windowpane?

147
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:00,167
No. Why?

148
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,227
Can you make one?

149
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,505
No. Why?

150
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,345
Can you fix this one?
Make it so it can look unopened?

151
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,140
You need a fake passport, too?

152
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,435
I got Ken Cosgrove's
paycheck by mistake.

153
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:20,264
- I opened it.
- How did that happen?

154
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,625
A mistake.

155
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,758
Just throw it away.

156
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:28,029
He'll ask for it by the end of the day.
They'll cut him a new one.

157
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:30,832
Don't throw it away here, though.
People go through the trash.

158
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:31,952
Of course.

159
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,036
So, are you upset
about getting caught?

160
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,705
Or are you upset
about what you saw?

161
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,563
I don't know if this
would mean much to you.

162
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,628
It's 300 a week before taxes.

163
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,931
We're married.
I have a baby due in august.

164
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,274
You know what Jennifer said?

165
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,772
She thinks that I should just go in
and demand a raise.

166
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,842
You told your wife about this?

167
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:03,397
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.
I didn't know what to do.

168
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,101
There's nothing you can do.

169
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,571
That's why you don't
tell your wife.

170
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:09,361
Wish you hadn't told me.

171
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:10,946
I think she's right.

172
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:13,156
But isn't media a meritocracy?

173
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,819
Do you think that?

174
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,994
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?
I have plenty of merit.

175
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,441
Merit defined within reason.

176
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:23,708
As in this place
can't run without you?

177
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,846
How the hell do we do that?

178
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,299
Then you're worth every
penny they're paying you.

179
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:32,745
Thanks, Sal.

180
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,038
<i>Mr. Draper, mr. Sterling</i>

181
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,508
<i>and Ben Cosgrove
are here to see you.</i>

182
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:43,980
Ken.

183
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:45,792
Bad news.

184
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,444
So bad I don't feel like telling you.
Cosgrove.

185
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:51,228
We were shooting
Jimmy Barrett for UTZ,

186
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,046
- and...
- don't pussyfoot around.

187
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,808
- Just tell him.
- I'm trying to tell him.

188
00:10:56,426 --> 00:10:58,285
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,380
Why don't you get your own?

190
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,122
We have a whole storeroom
full of Luckys.

191
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,821
Because I don't smoke.

192
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,146
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling
made a surprise visit to the set,

193
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,603
and they got the full
Jimmy Barrett treatment.

194
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,548
<i>Mr. Rumsen's coming in.</i>

195
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,685
I don't care that you drink, Freddie,
but it's interfering with your job.

196
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,667
Only an idiot would put Jimmy Barrett
in a room with her.

197
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:17,679
No visits.

198
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,973
How bad was it?

199
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,134
He called her the Hindenburg.

200
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:25,271
And, uh, he said something
about the whale in Pinocchio.

201
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:32,152
Did you laugh in front
of the Schillings?

202
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,916
Of course not. I was mortified.

203
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,540
- You know, my mother's heavyset.
- I stopped it right away.

204
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,478
So what we're dealing with here is that
you failed to control jimmy barrett,

205
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,457
and you failed to control
mr. And mrs. Utz,

206
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,381
so maybe both of you
aren't suited for these tasks.

207
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,909
- <i>Mr. Phillips is here.</i>
- Perfect.

208
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:52,190
Utz is going to lose Jimmy,
and we're going to lose Utz.

209
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,101
God. I Miss the'50s.

210
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,219
Has anyone tried to save this yet
besides leopold and loeb over here?

211
00:11:57,558 --> 00:12:00,789
Can't get the Schillings on the phone.
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.

212
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:03,726
I'm sure he'll feel real bad
about it tonight and give her a call.

213
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,761
Don, can you work him over?

214
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:08,021
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.

215
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,903
Don's going to fix it.

216
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:12,442
He knows what that nut means to Utz
and what Utz means to us.

217
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:13,902
Fix what, exactly?

218
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:16,280
Fix this mess that was made
because Freddie got him drunk.

219
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,334
Come on. Cosgrove should have told me
they were here.

220
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:21,186
I would have never
let her near that set.

221
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:24,371
I did. I told Lois.
I took them by here, but you were out.

222
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,417
I'm going to talk
to the Schillings,

223
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:36,513
then I'm going to explain
the facts of life to jimmy.

224
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,612
That'll work.
A guy like that must know

225
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,398
how to make a charming apology,
or he'd be dead.

226
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,398
Where were you?

227
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,109
At the Printer's.

228
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,237
You should tell your girl that.

229
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:01,074
Lois.

230
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:06,706
Close the door.

231
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:11,538
Sit down.

232
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:13,963
Stand.

233
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,697
I'd like to find a way
not to be cruel,

234
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:19,134
but I don't think it would be serving
either one of us.

235
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,951
Are you firing me?

236
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,369
No.

237
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,298
It's nice to know that you
care about something.

238
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,669
Are you trying to think
of what you could possibly say

239
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,188
to make up for
what's happened here?

240
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,476
What happened?

241
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,402
I think you're not
suited for this job.

242
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,163
What did I do?

243
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:42,167
In addition to being incompetent,

244
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,410
you threatened my reputation,
and not just today.

245
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,078
Mr. Draper, I try to cover
for you all the time.

246
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,938
You do not cover for me.

247
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:51,875
You manage people's expectations.

248
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,165
Can you be more specific?

249
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,149
You really want that?

250
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:58,662
No, I guess not.

251
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:02,303
You're not suited for this job.
It's not an insult.

252
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,624
It's just the way it is.

253
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,412
Stick to the switchboard.

254
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,645
Please tell Miss holloway
on your way out.

255
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:14,057
Yes, Mr. Draper.

256
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,920
Is there something due
tomorrow I don't know about?

257
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:27,969
No.

258
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,544
Already finding ways
not to go home, are we?

259
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,851
Edgar fladen, CBS, please.

260
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:47,919
Hello.

261
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,294
<i>Fladdy. Harry Crane. How are you?</i>

262
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:52,264
Still at work, same as you.

263
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,173
<i>How you like it over there?</i>

264
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:57,358
Did Sterling coo lose
some of its drunken luster?

265
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,669
I don't know.

266
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:01,403
I was thinking maybe I have
to move out to move up.

267
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,528
Forget about here.
They're picking us off.

268
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:05,198
I'm one gone paleface.

269
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,073
Well, thought I'd ask.

270
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,829
Keep your ear to the ground for me.
Doesn't have to be there.

271
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,654
Hey, how about some concern?

272
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,467
I just lost Lever brothers
and Kimberly Clark

273
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,343
from one of my biggest shows.

274
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,717
We're lousy with sponsors over here.
What do you need?

275
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:20,967
<i>Don't get excited.
Sponsors drop out for a reason.</i>

276
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,965
Not always.

277
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,085
Okay. Try this on.

278
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:26,918
The Defenders. Top 20 show.

279
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:30,326
E. G. Marshall, Bob Reed. Lawyers,
but, you know, they really care.

280
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,351
So this writers turn in this script
about a cannibal.

281
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,077
A cannibal lawyer?

282
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,524
The director eats up all this time
refusing to do it,

283
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,901
like his resume isn't filled
with crap, and surprise,

284
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,782
<i>the writers have only
one other script ready...</i>

285
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,968
Something we threw away last year

286
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,338
because they used the word abortion

287
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,122
30 times in 51 minutes.

288
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,718
Why?

289
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,958
Because they show one,
opening scene.

290
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,839
<i>Exactly. The whole thing was a ploy
to get us to shoot it.</i>

291
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:05,675
They think they're so clever.
I tell you, I miss the blacklist.

292
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,911
Send it over. I want to see it.

293
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:11,348
<i>I'm sure. It's going
on the air, sponsor or no.</i>

294
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,058
I'll watch it with you in the bar
where I'll be working.

295
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,218
Send it over. Let me
see what I can do.

296
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:17,338
<i>All right.</i>

297
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,196
Miss holloway, good morning.

298
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,131
I'll be taking care of you
while we search

299
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,473
for a suitable candidate.

300
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,562
I am really sorry about that.

301
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:32,182
Did she leave everything
in a condition you can follow?

302
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:34,872
Perhaps if you were
involved in the selection.

303
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,547
What can I tell?

304
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,861
I'll just continue looking
for another Miss Olsen.

305
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:41,484
No. I want someone
who'll be happy with that job.

306
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,954
Well, for the time
being, that's me.

307
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,383
How about a cup of coffee?
I think I remember how you take it.

308
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:48,344
Sure.

309
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,542
- Is Jimmy Barrett shooting today?
- Yes. At Eue.

310
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:55,318
What time do they start?

311
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,219
They were supposed
to start this morning,

312
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:59,120
but Mr. Barrett's been
showing up around 4.

313
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,504
Wake me at 3:30.

314
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,358
We'll start
with your correspondence.

315
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:08,489
<i>Did you go to that office
for the purpose of obtaining</i>

316
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,159
<i>an illegal operation?</i>

317
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:11,848
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:15,130
<i>- Were you pregnant?
- Yes.</i>

319
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,707
<i>Then you went to Dr. Montgomery
for an abortion.</i>

320
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:19,800
<i>Yes.</i>

321
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,795
<i>Was the abortion performed?
Just a moment.</i>

322
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,801
<i>Mr. Preston, aren't you
going to object?</i>

323
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,281
<i>The witness is not
a qualified medical expert.</i>

324
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:31,049
<i>The defense is willing to concede
that an operation was performed</i>

325
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,173
<i>on Miss stafford, which resulted
in the termination of a pregnancy.</i>

326
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:36,057
<i>Very well. You may proceed.</i>

327
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,565
Come here a lot, do you?

328
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,077
Not if everything's
running smoothly.

329
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:48,646
So buy me a drink.

330
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:51,240
I think there's been
plenty of drinking here.

331
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,032
Jimmy around?

332
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:56,218
He left early.
Rehearsal at the copa.

333
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:57,329
Forgot this.

334
00:17:57,632 --> 00:17:58,998
Isn't that our tuxedo?

335
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,119
He likes it better.

336
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,668
Great. So let's go talk to him.

337
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:06,207
There's no reason for that.

338
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:07,806
Talk to his manager.

339
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,369
How can I help you?

340
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,015
I'm sorry. In the pitch,
you were introduced as his wife.

341
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,176
Would you prefer
I pretend to be his sister,

342
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,050
like I did in the old days?

343
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,354
Wife, manager, someone should have kept
a lid on him yesterday.

344
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,545
I've seen the man sober.
He's not funny.

345
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,526
- Mrs. Barrett...
- Bobbie.

346
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,676
He can come in here with vomit
in his pockets for all I care.

347
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:34,146
But these people
are his benefactors.

348
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,933
Like the Medicis of Florence,

349
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,496
they're patrons of his art.

350
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,209
Mr. And Mrs. Utz.

351
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:46,271
I want you to imagine something
that Jimmy obviously can't.

352
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:50,882
The Schillings were very excited
to see their favorite comedian.

353
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:54,051
Then they know that being picked
on by Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.

354
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:55,929
No one was laughing.

355
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,260
That's not what I heard.

356
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,254
I'll tell you what.

357
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,153
They're in the big city
for the weekend.

358
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,521
Why don't they just go out
and buy a thicker skin?

359
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:10,931
You are aware
that all of this can go away.

360
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,698
No more free Tuxedos.

361
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,992
We have a contract.

362
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,994
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.

363
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:21,870
You?

364
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,332
Jimmy doesn't have a lot
of patience for business

365
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:26,710
or for businessmen.

366
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,998
In fact, I'm pretty sure
he already hates you.

367
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:31,041
Really?

368
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:35,636
Some glib ad man in that suit,

369
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,624
cigarette perfectly in hand,

370
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:41,121
not a hair out of place, here
to tell him he's been a bad boy?

371
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,591
Well, he has been.

372
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,645
So what do you suggest I do?

373
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,985
He has to know that you're a fan,

374
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,886
and that he knows more than you,

375
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:57,811
and that he's got a shot
with your wife.

376
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,409
Girlfriend? Both?

377
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:01,548
Wife.

378
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,369
So who's going to have
a talk with him, you or me?

379
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,001
Neither of us.

380
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,808
I have to go.

381
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,005
Let me drive you over.

382
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,970
Give up, will you?

383
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:17,719
It's raining.

384
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,880
What's that?

385
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,491
Hail.

386
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:08,701
Bobbie.

387
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:11,106
Don.

388
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,895
I don't want to do this.

389
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,422
Doesn't feel that way.

390
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:34,922
Hi, daddy.

391
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,107
Hi, daddy.

392
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:37,979
Hey, you.

393
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:39,975
How was work?

394
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,047
Fine.

395
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:47,391
Can I ask daddy?

396
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,852
What do you want?

397
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:56,084
I'm fine.

398
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,359
You can ask him, but he's not going
to disagree with me.

399
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,368
Ask me what?

400
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,691
Could we go riding
with mommy on saturday?

401
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,500
No.

402
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:15,201
There are just going
to be mommies there.

403
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,547
I'll need you to watch them.
It's a couple of hours.

404
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,050
But she promised.

405
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:22,763
"She"?

406
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,724
Not this saturday.
It didn't work out.

407
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,643
You can ride me around the den.

408
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,147
I picked up your watch.
Good as new.

409
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,024
Open it.

410
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,406
I got it monogrammed.

411
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:49,648
Well, Betts.

412
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:52,899
Thank you.

413
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,278
What are you doing?

414
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,092
I think she's out of gas.
Thought I'd fill her up.

415
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:46,435
They feed them in the barn.

416
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:49,030
You're ruining that horse
for whoever has her next.

417
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,435
I want it on record that she was ruined
when I got to her.

418
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,409
Just pull up on the reins.
Straighten her out.

419
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,590
You can't let her do that.

420
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,030
You don't for a minute think
you might be hurting her?

421
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,965
She needs to be told what to do.

422
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:05,427
- don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid, but...

423
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:07,594
I am curious why I'm riding Nehi

424
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,993
and you've got Copenhagen.

425
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,120
Some horses have better names.

426
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:15,581
Where's your girlfriend,
Mrs. Carson?

427
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,675
Her daughter has a ballet recital.

428
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:21,462
I'm really not afraid, you know?

429
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:23,658
I've just always been more
comfortable with animals

430
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,841
when they were on
the other end of my rifle.

431
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,470
That's a terrible attitude.

432
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,928
It is, and I've tried
to explain it to Tara,

433
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,347
but she won't listen.

434
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,319
All the men in her family
ride like this.

435
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:37,729
I also don't work, so
maybe I'm wrong about it.

436
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:40,364
I should go warm him up.

437
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:42,066
Tally-ho.

438
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,999
I'll be right back.

439
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:28,701
Hello?

440
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,743
Hello. It's Don Draper.
Can you talk?

441
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,694
I'm glad you called.

442
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,449
<i>How are you?</i>

443
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:40,709
Weren't you afraid you'd get Jimmy?

444
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,875
No, I wanted to invite
you both to dinner.

445
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:44,117
Monday night.

446
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,794
<i>A command performance.</i>

447
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,436
I was thinking Lutèce.

448
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:51,970
It will be formal.
Can you get him there?

449
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:54,877
I told you. He does whatever I say.

450
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,099
Keep it small.

451
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,019
My wife, the Schillings, you.

452
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,506
Okay. If that's what you want.

453
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,235
What do you want?

454
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,406
It's that kind
of phone call, is it?

455
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:16,243
Where are you?

456
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:18,996
In my home.

457
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:21,158
With my children.

458
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:22,811
<i>Really?</i>

459
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:28,465
I like being bad and then
going home and being good.

460
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:32,385
<i>I'll see you monday.</i>

461
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,370
Have a wonderful weekend.

462
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:04,571
Did you have a nice ride?

463
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,435
Don't smoke in here. They hate it.

464
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:12,216
I don't know. Place burns down,
I could give this up.

465
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:15,758
I assume you're trying to be funny,
but most of the people who ride here...

466
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,771
Hold on. Mrs. Draper...

467
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,808
I'm so sorry.
That's not what I meant.

468
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,205
Just because you don't
know what you're doing

469
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,384
doesn't mean the rest
of us are silly.

470
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:25,859
I apologize.

471
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,396
Girls and their horses.

472
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:32,648
I can't figure you out.

473
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,071
Why would you want to do that?

474
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:38,434
When Tara came to visit,
I could tell she was jealous.

475
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:41,385
Of your two old lady friends.

476
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:44,582
She certainly seems like
a girl who has everything.

477
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,746
She does.

478
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,632
When she was at Wellesley,

479
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,691
she came for a couple
of weekends to New Haven.

480
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:51,161
I remember those.

481
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,713
So exciting.

482
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,285
We got into a kind
of pattern, where

483
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:58,747
there'd be a warm reunion,
a football game,

484
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,191
and some kind of obscure argument.

485
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,988
You know, I would soothe,
and she would pout...

486
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,775
You know, Mr. Case, having
been married for some time,

487
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,066
I can tell you, your fiancée
would be very unhappy

488
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,359
with you sharing this
with a stranger.

489
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:14,321
Arthur.

490
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,573
I don't know why I brought that up.

491
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:22,623
I guess I just rembered going home
with her that first time.

492
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,248
Pulling off the merritt parkway
and hitting this long, private road.

493
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,235
You know that
Scott Fitzgerald story,

494
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:30,055
"A diamond as big as the ritz"?

495
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:30,982
No.

496
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,924
Her house is a slightly smaller version
of my high school.

497
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:38,315
And I realized why she was
so happy all the time,

498
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:41,765
and then, why she was so angry
when she didn't get what she wanted.

499
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,817
- All girls are like that.
- You aren't.

500
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:46,387
You don't know that.

501
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:49,362
You are so beautiful.

502
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:50,876
Thank you.

503
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,461
So different than Tara.

504
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,779
Tara is very beautiful.
You know that.

505
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,001
She doesn't need anything.

506
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:59,865
What she does need,
anyone can get her.

507
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,812
You're nervous about getting married.
You'll see.

508
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,916
You don't know what
she'll mean to you.

509
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,335
But I think about you.

510
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:13,630
Why would you do that?

511
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:17,798
Arthur, I like being around you.

512
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,968
Don't say anything to ruin that.

513
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,563
You're so profoundly sad.

514
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,569
No.

515
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,482
It's just my people are nordic.

516
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:36,842
Don't do that.

517
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,311
Don't tell me what to do.

518
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,915
You're so profoundly sad.

519
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,561
You're wrong.

520
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm grateful.

521
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:34,794
How was it?

522
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,381
I'm sorry I'm late.
Thank you for watching them.

523
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,342
- Come in here.
- I should get cleaned up.

524
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,761
I don't care.

525
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:44,304
Listen.

526
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,972
How do you feel about
Lutèce monday night?

527
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:51,409
Lutèce?

528
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,230
Pleased, I guess.

529
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:57,649
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.

530
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,656
- Why?
- Business.

531
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,951
Hunt schilling from Utz potato chips
and wives.

532
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,955
Is this one where I talk,
or I don't talk?

533
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:12,876
You need to charm him.

534
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,336
I need you to be shiny and bright.
I need a better half.

535
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,034
Monday night.

536
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,769
- You have plans?
- I'll have to find something to wear.

537
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:24,172
It's no notice. No notice at all.

538
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,094
Birdie,

539
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,972
we'll go there alone another time.

540
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,702
<i>What is it?</i>

541
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,628
<i>What is it? What's this
got to do with you?</i>

542
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,773
<i>"He helped me," says Sam.</i>

543
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:53,138
<i>Is this you?</i>

544
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,770
<i>They're writing this about you?</i>

545
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,208
<i>Answer me! Are you
mixed up in this?</i>

546
00:31:58,328 --> 00:32:00,129
<i>- Answer me!
- Mr. Mason.</i>

547
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,001
<i>You keep out of this!</i>

548
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,175
<i>Sandra Mace.</i>

549
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,521
<i>I was reading about this.</i>

550
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,236
<i>I was thanking God</i>

551
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:11,281
<i>that my daughter wasn't
the kind of a girl that was...</i>

552
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:14,435
<i>Would be mixed up
in anything ugly like this.</i>

553
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,394
<i>Please, daddy, don't.</i>

554
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:20,457
<i>I was even feeling sorry for the parents
of the girls who were involved.</i>

555
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:22,643
<i>- Please, please...
- Please?</i>

556
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:24,457
<i>Eighteen years old!</i>

557
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,529
<i>You have to have
an illegitimate child</i>

558
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,145
<i>taken away from you
by some filthy doctor!</i>

559
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:30,910
<i>Mr. Mason!</i>

560
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,143
<i>You get out of my house!</i>

561
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,832
I do want to see the rest of this,
but I get the idea.

562
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:39,026
- I'm her father!
- Then behave as though you a...

563
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:44,841
Top 20 show, prime time,
for pennies on the dollar.

564
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:47,332
And it's the perfect match
for Belle Jolie lipstick.

565
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:49,886
Really? How does that work?

566
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:52,208
Controversy means viewers.

567
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:54,876
Women will find
a way to watch this.

568
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,958
Maybe just because they don't want
to get left out.

569
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,259
Is that true?

570
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:02,984
There's no doubt in my mind.

571
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,958
We can talk to them
about putting on a warning.

572
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:08,644
Research shows,
rules are made to be broken.

573
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:11,153
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.

574
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,399
This discussion,
it's uncomfortable.

575
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,828
This show is troubling.

576
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,505
It's catharsis.

577
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,539
That's hard to come by.

578
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,132
What is better than tears
to make a girl

579
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,128
ready to hear she can be beautiful?

580
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,024
I'd love to see a spike.

581
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:27,083
But what do I do when
Hugh Brody asks

582
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:28,718
what the hell this is?

583
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:31,136
Belle Jolie is a family company.

584
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,097
This is not wholesome.

585
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:36,092
There are limits to what
you can get out of daytime.

586
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:38,947
I don't want Belle Jolie
to be part of this debate.

587
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:42,272
So you think girls who buy lipstick
aren't going to be interested in this?

588
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,029
I don't care where they stand.
So it's political.

589
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,583
Politics are in.
Women will be watching.

590
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:49,919
Young women.

591
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:52,017
I'm sorry.

592
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:57,257
We thought you should know about it.

593
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,271
I have to say, I'm very impressed

594
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:03,041
you brought this to us.

595
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,147
I wish we were
a different kind of company.

596
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:06,917
We all work for someone.

597
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:11,302
- It was a pleasure.
- Pleasure.

598
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:15,682
- How's it going?
- Very well, thank you.

599
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,430
- You said you wanted to see me?
- Yes, I did.

600
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:37,870
- You're Harry Crane, right?
- Yes, I am.

601
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,998
Certain things have
come to my attention.

602
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,458
No.

603
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:44,433
I heard about it
third-hand, and I thought

604
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,587
it sounded reckless,
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.

605
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:48,296
Mr. Cooper knows about this?

606
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,008
I think someone told on you.
And it backfired.

607
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,005
- Mitch.
- Doesn't matter.

608
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,946
Cooper thought
it showed initiative.

609
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:58,521
So, you're in here now,
and I'm smiling.

610
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,100
What do you want?

611
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:06,685
I guess, for one thing,

612
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,278
I think that we should have
a television department.

613
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,613
All the other agencies have them.
And I think I should run it.

614
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:16,084
You're now the head
of the tv department,

615
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,645
which is comprised solely of you.
Anything else?

616
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,061
Well, actually, um...

617
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,583
I think I deserve a raise.

618
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,399
And I think

619
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:39,640
you've already received
a sizable reward.

620
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,602
- Let's not get greedy.
- I'm not being greedy.

621
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:44,670
Are you arguing with me?

622
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:48,775
- How much do you make?
- Two hundred dollars a week.

623
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,193
Plus drinks.

624
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,243
Give me a number.

625
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,742
How about 310?

626
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,523
No one makes that around here.
Not even close.

627
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:02,914
How about two and a quarter?
Say yes.

628
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,832
Yes.

629
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,295
I'll throw in new business cards.
You drive a hell of a bargain.

630
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:23,810
We really enjoyed visiting,
but we'd rather stay in a hotel.

631
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,222
Made my daughter-in-law happier.

632
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:30,106
Luckily, we're a long way
from those problems.

633
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:32,158
Although I do love the idea
of Bobby and Sally

634
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:34,328
having apartments and families.

635
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,641
Where is he?

636
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:40,325
Who?

637
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:43,654
Jimmy Barrett.

638
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,519
No, Hunt.

639
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,522
I don't think that would
be a good idea.

640
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,921
Edith, please.

641
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:55,258
He wants to apologize.

642
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:58,638
Oh, dear.

643
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:02,528
Well, he certainly
picked a nice place.

644
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:06,207
Hello, everybody.

645
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:09,151
Sorry we're late, but one of us likes
to make an entrance.

646
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,449
- Hello. Bobbie Barrett.
- Pleasure.

647
00:37:12,712 --> 00:37:14,485
- We've met before.
- I remember.

648
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:16,276
Mr. Draper.

649
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,729
This is my wife Betty.

650
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,116
Betty, this is Bobbie
and Jimmy Barrett.

651
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,204
Oh, my. I am such a fan.

652
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,455
When you imagine
someone saying that to you,

653
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,654
you always hope it's her.

654
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,276
And this one. My God.
Are you two sold separately?

655
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:34,589
Look, it's J.F.K.

656
00:37:34,749 --> 00:37:36,314
And you're not Jackie,
but you're definitely his type.

657
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:37,592
I've met him.

658
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:40,802
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.
You remember Hunt and Edith Schilling.

659
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,710
How could I forget?
They bought me a car.

660
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,380
A pleasure as always.

661
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,053
And the little lady.
Look at you, all dolled up.

662
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,116
What do you do, sweetheart?
I want to know everything.

663
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:56,736
I'm a housewife.

664
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:59,029
I bet little birds
hang up your laundry.

665
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,699
And we have a little boy
and a little girl.

666
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,547
Is that everything? Or you want to let
my imagination run wild?

667
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:07,215
By the way, I loved you
ingentleman's agreement.

668
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,585
Good evening,
<i>Mesdames</i> and <i>Monsieurs</i>.

669
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,251
The chef has prepared
many <i>specialités</i>

670
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:15,006
- which I will have the pleasure of...
- Just a minute, monsieur Le Pew.

671
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,458
Any chance we can get
a drink order filled?

672
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:18,403
Sorry, everybody,
but Jimmy's down a quart.

673
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:21,335
2 Johnnie Walkers, rocks.
Bobbie, you want anything?

674
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:23,208
- Dubonnet with a twist.
- <i>Bien sûr</i>.

675
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:26,120
And make it fast, while this place
is still french.

676
00:38:28,345 --> 00:38:30,582
- I hope you all like spit in your food.
- Come on.

677
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:32,024
I come here all the time.

678
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,206
Now, I have a few key
questions for Mrs. America.

679
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:38,137
Remember, Betsy,
everything's riding on this.

680
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,568
So really, what fills your days?

681
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:41,780
Eating bonbons?

682
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:44,700
Hitting tennis balls
with the needy?

683
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:47,572
Actually, I spend a lot
of my time riding horses.

684
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,162
It's really a passion for me.

685
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:50,623
And for them, I bet.

686
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,541
So big horses?
Give me an education.

687
00:38:53,702 --> 00:38:55,252
You don't want to hear about this.

688
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:58,547
No, I do. Is it the beauty pageant thing
where they walk in little bitty steps?

689
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:00,256
I'll be right back.

690
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,345
No. That's dressage.

691
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:05,513
I knew that.

692
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:08,266
It's the same kind of sale,
but I do jumping.

693
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,601
You two do any jumping?

694
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:13,813
I'm sorry. Can you
excuse me a moment?

695
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:16,662
All this talk about horses, huh?

696
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,993
What, are you expecting
a chinese baby?

697
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,060
I don't know what it is,
but one thing I know

698
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,707
is it's not chinese.

699
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:32,581
We're both very proud of you.

700
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:36,185
Well, good. Because a 121 % raise
is nothing to sneeze at.

701
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,324
I don't care about the money.
Well...

702
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,837
The money's nice.

703
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:46,012
I just can't wait to go
into the phone company tomorrow

704
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:48,932
and tell the girls that my husband
is the head of television

705
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:50,376
at Sterling Cooper.

706
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:53,738
Do you feel well enough to go in?
Because you don't have to.

707
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,013
You're sweet.

708
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:00,486
What did you do?

709
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:04,368
Well, I took this tv show
that no one wanted

710
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,949
to sponsor, and I told one
of our clients about it.

711
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:08,709
And you sold it?

712
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:12,527
No, but everyone was impressed
that I recognized the opportunity.

713
00:40:13,363 --> 00:40:14,795
What's the show?

714
00:40:15,628 --> 00:40:17,096
Just some show.

715
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:23,174
You wouldn't like it.

716
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:34,935
You look great.

717
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,079
Do I?

718
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,357
- I'm not feeling great.
- Why not?

719
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:42,655
I'm going to be brief

720
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:45,237
because I don't like leaving him
alone out there.

721
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:46,864
They're loving it.

722
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:48,929
They're being polite.

723
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:52,035
The window for
this apology is closing.

724
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:56,149
It has to happen before the appetizers,
or they will leave.

725
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:57,548
Really?

726
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,086
Because I was thinking about that,

727
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:03,816
so I took a look
at Jimmy's contract...

728
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:05,829
Well, me and a lawyer...

729
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:09,513
And I realized Jimmy doesn't have
to apologize at all.

730
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:13,557
In fact, they're going to have
to pay him, even if they fire him.

731
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:17,431
Especially because hurt feelings
isn't a very good reason.

732
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:21,249
So what is this all about?

733
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:26,188
I think an apology,
and a public one like this one,

734
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,276
has to be worth $25,000.

735
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,367
And I want it in the paper.

736
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,853
Say it's a bonus.

737
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:48,319
Believe me,

738
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,879
I will ruin him.

739
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:56,708
Do what I say.

740
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,734
- don't get up.
- I wasn't gonna.

741
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:18,490
But this one knows about horses.
Who knows?

742
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,361
I've been spending the whole
time watching her lips move.

743
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,571
I hope we haven't ordered yet
because there really is something

744
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,616
that we need to get out of the way.

745
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:37,915
He's picking up the check. I mean,
there's really no debate, is there?

746
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:44,060
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling, Jimmy has
something that he'd like to say to you.

747
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:56,151
Honestly, I'd rather eat your chips
than anything in this dump.

748
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,359
They have snails here, you know.

749
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,624
That's nice to hear.

750
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:03,208
Mrs. Schilling...

751
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:04,674
Edith...

752
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:07,505
I was out of line the other day.
I shouldn't have said it to you,

753
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:09,053
and not just cause
you're married to him.

754
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,691
I shouldn't have said it to anybody,
not in that environment.

755
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:13,461
Sweetheart, look at me.

756
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,845
You, too, Hunt.

757
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:16,688
Can I call you Hunt?

758
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:19,240
There's the guy under the lights,
and there's me.

759
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,300
He's made me rich,
but he hasn't made me very nice.

760
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:25,227
I hope we can put it behind us.

761
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,804
I know that's what you do.

762
00:43:28,924 --> 00:43:31,153
I guess I just don't
have the stomach for it.

763
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:39,162
Well, I'm famished.

764
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:48,739
Excuse me.

765
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:19,812
Betts, you all right?

766
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,014
Nothing.

767
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:31,056
Nothing's wrong.

768
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:34,880
I'm just so happy.

769
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,403
When I said I wanted to be

770
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,563
a part of your life...

771
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:49,599
This is what I meant.

772
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,684
We make a great team.
