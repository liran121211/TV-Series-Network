1
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,327
Mad Men 2x9
<i>Six Month Leave</i>

2
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,435
Kids, it's time to go!

3
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:57,203
Coming, Carla.

4
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,654
And I said I liked her name.

5
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:09,812
Cocoa's a nice name.
Isn't it?

6
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,866
Yes, it is.

7
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,920
Come on, Bobby. Let's go.

8
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:23,223
All right. Let's go.

9
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,731
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:31,800
- Peggy.
- Good morning, Don.

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,108
- Good morning, Mr. Draper.
- Hollis.

12
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,483
You hear about Marilyn?
Poor thing.

13
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:42,187
It's very upsetting.

14
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,034
I can't say I'm surprised.
The few things I know about her.

15
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:48,677
You just don't imagine
her ever being alone.

16
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:49,903
She was so famous.

17
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,646
Some people just hide
in plain sight.

18
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,320
My mother and sister keep calling.

20
00:01:58,357 --> 00:01:59,907
Suicide is disturbing.

21
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,671
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.

22
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:12,365
We're lucky Playtex didn't go
for that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.

23
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,550
We'd have to pull
everything indefinitely.

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,020
Yes, that's true.

25
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,949
I've never taken pills,

26
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,209
even when I had a headache.

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,303
Mr. Draper, good morning.
Would you like coffee?

28
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,803
I already had some.

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,039
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

30
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,052
Do you need to go home?

31
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,522
No. Of course not.

32
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,992
I have Warren, and I have Todd.

33
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:53,178
Todd is a mail boy.
Why do you have him?

34
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,385
I'm paying him.

35
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:56,551
I'm sorry. I don't understand
this stupid blood drive.

36
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,534
You just hate that Media
wins every year.

37
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,117
Wins what? How do you win a
blood drive? What do you win?

38
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,812
I don't know. You're
the best or something.

39
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,240
I'll be lucky if Accounts
can get eight people.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,857
Campbell's afraid of needles,
Duck doesn't give two craps.

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,866
- Good morning.
- Good morning, fellas.

42
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,573
Is this program
already in progress?

43
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,990
We're expecting our most
successful blood drive ever.

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,839
Yes. Tell me everything.

45
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,910
I think we're very organized.

46
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,615
Creative, our department,

47
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,234
will be at 75 to 80% participation.

48
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,208
Of course, I'm assuming
you are in.

49
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:27,614
I am.

50
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:30,321
Do Kurt and Smitty
count as one person?

51
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,867
Why don't you bore me
with the details?

52
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:34,553
We're going to take the lockers
out of the break room,

53
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,052
put them in the hallway
in the morning.

54
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,115
There will be two litters,
three nurses,

55
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,739
at least one old lady serving
refreshments, and plenty of chairs.

56
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:43,177
Kinsey, I want you to pull
every intern and lackey...

57
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,264
switchboard, elevator men.

58
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,238
Find out who wants
to be a copywriter for the day.

59
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,485
- Dollar a head.
- That's not fair.

60
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:52,688
You're in Accounts.
You should have thought of it.

61
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:53,861
Just to be clear,

62
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:57,701
do I get the dollar
for each person I get,

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,325
or do they get it
for giving blood?

64
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,711
The people giving blood.
This is for mankind, Kinsey.

65
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:05,820
That's the money they'd make
actually being in the art department.

66
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,124
So what is the prize?

67
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,289
Helping another human being.

68
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,337
Also, there will be women fainting.
I'd think you'd like that.

69
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,509
If this was a flat-out athletic
competion, Accounts would win,

70
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:17,752
without a doubt.

71
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:20,376
What an elegant surrender.
And put up more posters.

72
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,939
I can't believe I have
to say that to you people.

73
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,811
Apparently, if we get
100% participation,

74
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,440
which Media will do its best to aid,
they're going to put us in the Times.

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,001
I booked a photographer,
just in case.

76
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:29,997
Good.

77
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:32,500
NBC's having the Mitch Miller
concert on Thursday.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,538
Any chance I could show
you and Mr. Draper off?

79
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,112
We'd love to, but...

80
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,440
my kid is sick.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,631
You'll know what
that means soon enough.

82
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,369
Shot down.

83
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,577
That was quick.

84
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,365
What do we have today?

85
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,694
The 10:00 with Miss Holloway
to go over traffic for new business,

86
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:41,064
4:00 with Ron Venincasa
from Ace Hardware,

87
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,313
and M. Sterling moved the meeting
with Boston Edison to 5.

88
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,061
I assume to have it bleed
into the cocktail hour.

89
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,459
May I?

90
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:01,372
there was a bit
of confusion last night.

91
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:03,323
I think I made a terrible mistake.

92
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,242
What happened?

93
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,076
Your daughter called and asked

94
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,071
when you would be back
from your business trip

95
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,120
because her mother wasn't sure.

96
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,813
You don't have to tell me anything,
but I didn't know what to say.

97
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,179
I said Wednesday. I know
I should have said I don't know.

98
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,211
Mrs. Draper is working out
some things.

99
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:29,225
I understand. I'm sure
it won't come up again.

100
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:33,882
I thought it would be over by now.
Yes, and there'd be no need to...

101
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,006
I'm sorry about that.

102
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:39,889
It goes without saying
that this is personal,

103
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,704
and I'd appreciate
your keeping it that way.

104
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:43,824
Of course.

105
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,160
I'd also avoid giving
me concerned looks.

106
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,371
I hope you've noticed
I'm a discreet person.

107
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,767
I don't know you at all,
and this is personal,

108
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,458
and it's not up for discussion.

109
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:57,698
Of course.

110
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,672
If you need anything,
I'm right out there.

111
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,889
I'm at the Roosevelt
if there's an emergency.

112
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>In an interview just weeks
before her death,</i>

113
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,079
<i>Miss Monroe angrily
protested to a reporter</i>

114
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,078
<i>about attacks on stars.</i>

115
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,641
<i>"We're what's okay with the
movie business," she said.</i>

116
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:38,851
<i>Management is what's wrong
with the business."</i>

117
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,516
<i>Mr. Campbell, Miss Olsen
and Mr. Romano are here.</i>

118
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,261
Send them in.

119
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,016
My oldest just turned 30,

120
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:12,828
and she's had a string
of bad beaux.

121
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,836
It's very upsetting.

122
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,329
Can I get you kids anything?

123
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:17,958
- I'm fine.
- I'll have something.

124
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:19,876
They're probably walking over.

125
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,136
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.

126
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:24,392
I'll do introductions.

127
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,581
Jeff Hartung's wife
just had a baby.

128
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:27,951
Boy or girl?

129
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:29,172
That's good.

130
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:31,267
Then I talk about Volkswagen.

131
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,599
No. Don said we only bring up Volkswagen
if they don't like what we've presented.

132
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,858
- Then I throw it to you, Freddie.
- Thank you, Freddie.

133
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,769
"I just got a brand-new
Samsonite Silhouette,"

134
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:44,889
"and I hate it."

135
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:48,029
"Don't get me wrong. I love
the shape, the size, the color,"

136
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,867
"and I love the Silhouette
because it's a Samsonite,"

137
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,578
"so I know we're going to go
lots of places together,"

138
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,148
see lots of things,

139
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,329
collect a lifetime of memories.

140
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,999
I hate my Silhouette
because it's empty.

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Then Sal.

142
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,081
Shouldn't the artwork come first?

143
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,632
What about unveiling it?

144
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,301
You know how excited they get.

145
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,830
What the hell, Freddie?

146
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,791
What...

147
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:25,233
What were we talking about?
Two types of travelers.

148
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:30,596
Freddie, do you have another
pair of trousers here?

149
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:32,763
Why?

150
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,410
Jesus.

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Jesus.

152
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,667
I... I'll fix this. I...

153
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,478
I need a... I need a minute.

154
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,993
I got to think.

155
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:03,764
Is he dead?

156
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,526
No, he's not dead. He passed out.

157
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,579
He's fine.

158
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,948
<i>The Hartungs are at reception.</i>

159
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,464
We'll be right there.
Thanks, Abigail.

160
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,144
He can't leave this room.

161
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,014
They're all from Colorado.

162
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:26,268
I guess I could push it
until tomorrow,

163
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:28,838
book them another night
at the Carlyle.

164
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,708
- Should I just cancel it?
- I should talk to Don.

165
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:33,519
That's not necessary.
I can handle this.

166
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,441
Fine.

167
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,893
Jesus. It's a suitcase.

168
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,863
Peggy, you can do it, right?

169
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,906
You think it's going
to be better tomorrow?

170
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:41,826
Shit.

171
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,871
It'll be fine.

172
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,649
We'll tell them Freddie's sick.
It's true.

173
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:49,401
I'll go to reception.
You two go to the conference room

174
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,695
and act like you've been waiting.
But don't look mad.

175
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:53,528
Someone tell Freddie's
girl it's cancelled.

176
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,493
I don't want him wandering in.

177
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,871
- It's disgusting.
- There's no need for that.

178
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,847
Can I speak to you for a minute?

179
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,910
I forgot you were coming by.

180
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,188
Are you okay?

181
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,066
I haven't been feeling well.

182
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,097
No, Betty.

183
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,411
You and Don are still
coming tonight, I hope.

184
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,411
We'd love to. I just don't think
I'll be up to it.

185
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,881
That ruins things.

186
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,782
You wanted to borrow
the black chiffon, right?

187
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,408
- Come upstairs.
- Are you sure?

188
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,240
I don't know who I'm going to talk to.
Raymond has to work these things.

189
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,411
And I got you out of bed?
I am so sorry.

190
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:32,412
Give me the black one,
and I'll go.

191
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:33,532
Nonsense.

192
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:40,045
I think my waist
is higher than yours.

193
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,928
What do you have that's generous?

194
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:44,525
I don't know.

195
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,367
How about this?

196
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:51,035
You'll look like sherbet.
Long white gloves.

197
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:53,105
I can't wear those after Gypsy.

198
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,569
Think you'll be better
by lunch on Thursday?

199
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,966
I'm looking forward to it.

200
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,550
This is youthful.

201
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:08,582
It doesn't matter. I'm invisible.

202
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:13,170
- That's not true.
- Raymond's sweet about it,

203
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,895
but he's so easy to please.

204
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,218
That's sweet.

205
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:20,404
It is.

206
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:24,299
I think, what did I do
to deserve him?

207
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,848
Then I spend his money
on Dr. Weinberg.

208
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,906
I got my diagnosis the other day.
I'm bored.

209
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:33,684
That's too bad.

210
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:36,421
I saw Arthur have a fight
with Tara,

211
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,441
and I have been having
ridiculous dreams since.

212
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:43,995
I wish you'd come ride with us again.
It really takes the pressure off.

213
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,994
Think you can carry this?

214
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:48,941
No, ma'am.

215
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,587
- You shouldn't talk to him so much.
- I know. It's embarrassing.

216
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:00,426
It's a switch you can
flip on and off, you know.

217
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,155
Really?

218
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:06,084
You don't even think
about this, do you?

219
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,407
Don's perfect.

220
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:18,133
Can we talk at lunch?
I'm really not feeling well.

221
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:20,412
Take them all.

222
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,182
No. Just these two.

223
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,607
That's it for today.

224
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,718
Many's the time I've dreamed
of finding you like this.

225
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:26,636
What are you doing here?

226
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,682
You're right. I'll just get all my
belongings, and I'll leave. It's 4:30.

227
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:32,327
You're supposed to be
sitting in a bar somewhere

228
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,810
waiting for Boston Edison.

229
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,562
How often do you come in here?

230
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,523
Not that often.

231
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,865
What's wrong, Red?
Do you miss me?

232
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,025
She was so young.

233
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:54,868
Not you, too.

234
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,850
Yes, I'm just another
frivolous secretary.

235
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,987
It's a terrible tragedy,

236
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:01,957
but that woman's a stranger.

237
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,671
Roosevelt...

238
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,615
I hated him, but I felt like
I knew him.

239
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:09,762
A lot of people felt like they knew her.
You should be sensitive to that.

240
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,527
Hé. You're not like her.

241
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,674
Physically, a little, but
don't tell me that makes you sad.

242
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,044
It's not a joke.

243
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,567
This world destroyed her.

244
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:25,604
Really? She was a movie
star who had everything

245
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:28,781
and everybody, and she
threw it away.

246
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:34,037
But, hey, if you want
to be sad.

247
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,726
One day you'll lose someone
who's important to you.

248
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,797
You'll see.

249
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,145
It's very painful.

250
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,068
Are you feeling better, mommy?

251
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:03,623
Yes. I'll join you next time.

252
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:08,279
I'm surprised daddy
let you in the car.

253
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,447
You kids should go to bed.

254
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:15,146
Wash your face and brush your teeth.
I'll tuck you in.

255
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:18,673
Good night.

256
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:21,808
You just came back.

257
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:25,425
Now you're leaving again?

258
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,034
It'll go by like that.

259
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,111
Come here.

260
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,324
It won't be that long, Salamander.

261
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:44,984
Go.

262
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,248
Listen, she called my office.

263
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,098
She did?

264
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:56,954
When?

265
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:58,674
Monday.

266
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,712
What do you want me to say?

267
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,184
I think she expected you
over the week-end.

268
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,972
You said you didn't want
me here, and then you do.

269
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:11,300
- I didn't want them involved in this.
- Obviously, that's impossible.

270
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,492
What do you want to do?

271
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,962
I mean, how long
is this going go on?

272
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:20,362
- We have to tell them something.
- Like what?

273
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,551
Okay. How about...

274
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,479
I'm working on an account.
They're putting me up in Philadelphia,

275
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,360
but I'll be home every week-end.

276
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:33,270
- Jesus. Did you just think that up?
- Or I could just come home.

277
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,420
Bets, what do you want?

278
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,185
Listen, if your mind's made up,
I'm not going to talk you into it.

279
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,502
I thought you can talk
anyone into anything.

280
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,272
Good night.

281
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,447
- Would you like coffee?
- And a bear claw.

282
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:21,184
What's this?

283
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,624
I thought you could use a few
more shirts in your rotation.

284
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,131
Thank you. Submit your receipt.

285
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,276
Your correspondence
is on your desk.

286
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:36,901
Let me get your breakfast.
I'll be right back.

287
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,400
And Mr. Kinsey said
that I have to drag you,

288
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,057
if necessary, to the blood drive.

289
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,783
You're not a fainter, are you?

290
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,683
I don't faint,
but I might cry after.

291
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:06,050
- Peggy.
- Hello, Freddie.

292
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,344
How'd it go yesterday?

293
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,216
I left word with Abigail.
They loved it.

294
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:10,336
Good. Good.

295
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:13,674
I was thinking about
letting you talk anyway.

296
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,513
I have to apologize
for putting you in that spot.

297
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,683
Freddie, it's over.
There's no reason to talk about it.

298
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:24,336
Of course.

299
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:26,811
Did they ask about me?

300
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:29,836
- We told them you were sick.
- That's good.

301
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,293
So, on Monday, when they
get back to Colorado,

302
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,194
I'll give them a call
and sew things up.

303
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,654
That's a great idea.

304
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:07,144
Mrs. Draper. I'm sorry
to bother you.

305
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,293
It's okay, Carla.

306
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,636
It's a beautiful day.

307
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,567
I'm going to take the children
out again. Is that good?

308
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,820
Whatever they want.

309
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:24,636
Can I do anything for you?
If you want, I can draw a bath.

310
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:25,949
No, thank you.

311
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,046
I've been married
almost 20 years, you know.

312
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:38,697
I really don't want
to talk about this.

313
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:39,817
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:41,886
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,415
I haven't been sleep...
sleeping very well.

316
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,011
You know what helps?

317
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:53,512
Splash cold water
on your face and go outside.

318
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:56,200
You'll notice things
are right where you left them.

319
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm usually part of
the meeting before the meeting.

320
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,848
Relax, Don. Sit down.

321
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,685
This is all being done
in the right way.

322
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:29,302
Don, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

323
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:32,325
We were on the launch pad
yesterday for Samsonite,

324
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,647
and Freddie Rumsen pissed
his pants.

325
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,265
What?

326
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:40,963
He's not talking about nerves here.
He's talking about a wet pair of pants.

327
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,950
Really?

328
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,658
How'd the presentation go?

329
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:47,910
Don, it's conduct unbefitting.

330
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:49,313
Of Freddie Rumsen?

331
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:51,452
We're lucky Campbell here
grabbed the controls.

332
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,580
He locked Rumsen up
and threw Peggy Olsen in.

333
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,731
We're lucky the bench is deep.

334
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,700
We have to cut him loose.

335
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,382
- Is that necessary?
- The man is a train wreck.

336
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:04,397
We at least need to get him
off this account.

337
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,411
They called already.
They're thrilled with Peggy.

338
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,481
No. I don't want him
on any of my accounts.

339
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,852
- This could have happened in a meeting.
- But it didn't.

340
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,874
That'll be all, boys.

341
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,479
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

342
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,088
We're not doing him any favors
keeping him around.

343
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:31,352
Duck's a teetotaler. He's been
gunning for Freddie since day 1.

344
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:32,728
He's got a point.

345
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:34,328
We can't even tell
Cooper about this.

346
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:36,918
You know his whole thing
with germs.

347
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:38,395
I don't think it's in my contract

348
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,393
that Duck can fire someone
in my department.

349
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,169
You don't have a contract,

350
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,275
and I can fire anyone
I want to.

351
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,427
We really don't have a choice.

352
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:49,241
You can still get him
to give blood.

353
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,666
The agencies will laugh about this,
but the clients,

354
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,810
they already think
we're all like that.

355
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,083
We'll say it's a six-month
leave of absence

356
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,955
so he can go for the cure.

357
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,925
He'll know what that means.

358
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,540
You don't want to throw him away.

359
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,399
Your loyalty is starting
to become a liability.

360
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,519
Let's do this before he finds out.
We don't need any more accidents.

361
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,808
Dinner tonight.

362
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,710
You need to call the missus?

363
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:20,272
I'll make it.

364
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:58,416
Mr. Case.

365
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:03,427
How are you?

366
00:25:04,141 --> 00:25:05,714
It's a beautiful day.

367
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,637
Have you just ridden,
or are you about to ride?

368
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,834
I can never tell whether
you're before or after.

369
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,304
I'm on my way out.

370
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,128
It's good to see you.

371
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,685
How are your children?

372
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:19,535
They're wonderful.

373
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,527
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?

374
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,144
I think so. Monday, maybe?

375
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:28,487
That's good news.
I'm glad she came.

376
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:30,765
Why?

377
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:32,393
Nothing.

378
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:34,636
I had noticed
she seemed distracted.

379
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:36,412
I shouldn't have said anything.

380
00:25:37,477 --> 00:25:39,081
Is there anything I can do?

381
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:42,172
No. But she'd be glad
to know you're concerned.

382
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:44,442
I think you make her feel better.

383
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:46,312
She talks about you a lot.

384
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:49,049
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

385
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:50,941
You know what?

386
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,580
The three of us should go
to lunch and have some fun.

387
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,972
It would cheer her up.

388
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,189
- It's a great idea.
- Thursday?

389
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,979
Café Soleil in Old Town. 1:00.

390
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,614
- I'll pick up the check.
- See you then.

391
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,186
That was nothing.
I'm thinking of doing it again.

392
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:21,462
You should smoke a cigarette right now.
I know they said not to,

393
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,416
but I'm telling you,
my knees buckled.

394
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:26,134
I thought I was going to
perform a full Freddie Rumsen.

395
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:27,588
Jesus.

396
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:32,395
Hello, Don. We're in the lead.
Turns out Hollis has a novel.

397
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:33,337
Good.

398
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,597
Too bad Freddie made
his donation yesterday.

399
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:37,932
He's a real wizz in advertising.

400
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:39,943
Jesus.

401
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:43,438
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

402
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:46,607
That's none of your business.

403
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:49,236
Freddie had a bad day.

404
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:50,708
Can't you find something
else to do

405
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,362
besides dining on the drama
of other people's lives

406
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:54,949
like a bunch of teenage girls?

407
00:26:57,144 --> 00:26:58,944
Sorry, Don. It's funny.

408
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:01,831
Sure.

409
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,874
It's just a man's name, right?

410
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,618
Could you leave us alone
for a moment?

411
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:18,068
Truth to tell,
I was a little nervous.

412
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:20,309
I'd never given one of those
funny speeches before

413
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,232
where you say what
you don't mean.

414
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,792
Freddie, we've reached a decision.

415
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:27,227
You're going to take a
six-month leave of absence.

416
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:31,256
- Is that necessary?
- The door will be open.

417
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,232
It was a snafu.

418
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:35,656
Isn't the embarrassment enough?

419
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:39,369
Full salary, you dry out, come back,
we'll see where we are.

420
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:43,916
Clients love me.
I keep up with them.

421
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,370
We have laughs.

422
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:48,003
Monday morning, I'll be
good as new, I promise.

423
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,839
There's a line, Freddie,
and you wet it.

424
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:55,036
You see? We're laughing about it.

425
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,606
What's the big deal?

426
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:59,180
You remember Bob Peebles?
How mean he was?

427
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:03,474
He fired his secretary, and he threw
all her things out the window,

428
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:04,768
including her keys.

429
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:07,222
That was good for morale.

430
00:28:10,843 --> 00:28:12,293
What is this about?

431
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,853
Duck Phillips?

432
00:28:14,852 --> 00:28:17,615
He's as dry as a bone.
He doesn't understand this business.

433
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,323
Freddie, my father would
have fired you for this.

434
00:28:20,443 --> 00:28:23,351
Your father drank more than
the two of you put together.

435
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:26,124
He used to come in
with his shirt on inside-out.

436
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:28,141
He admired you.

437
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,586
I, however, had different
feelings at the time.

438
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,537
When we first met,

439
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:34,852
Bonny Prince Sterling here
thought I was a coward

440
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,538
because I was in the Signal Corps.

441
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:38,190
I didn't know it was only
for his last six months.

442
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,013
I thought he was a typist.

443
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,664
Turns out before that,
he was in charge of killing people...

444
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,351
and by people, I mean Germans.

445
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:46,852
It was a long time ago.

446
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:49,774
Come on. Be proud.
What was it? Like 15 of them.

447
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,315
That's impressive.

448
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:56,137
Look, I can be
completely in control.

449
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,163
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.

450
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:02,618
Came back a new man with great stories.
Only drinks beer now.

451
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,833
It's the best thing, Freddie.

452
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:16,368
Well, I guess you get dealt
the hand you get dealt, right?

453
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,232
I can pull myself together.
I got a great book.

454
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,956
Maybe I'll head
to Philly or Boston.

455
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:31,718
They're all dying
to do what we do here.

456
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:33,440
You know I'll recommend you.

457
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,526
Fantastic. So this could be good.

458
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,694
There are a lot of great towns.

459
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,733
My father sold greeting cards.

460
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:45,288
He used to come into the kitchen,
unroll this map on the table,

461
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,600
and put a finger on a spot
and say something like,

462
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,208
"Memphis. Who wants to live
in Memphis?"

463
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:51,837
I'd say, "Not me."

464
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,666
We had only been in
Springfield for nine months.

465
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,685
Meanwhile, here we are.

466
00:29:58,787 --> 00:29:59,787
To New York.

467
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,177
Come on. Let's make a night of it.

468
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:06,524
- Really?
- Absolutely.

469
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,823
To Monday morning.

470
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,384
It'll be here
faster than you think.

471
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,633
Hold off on the menus.
We're going take another lap first.

472
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:19,307
Bring some bread.

473
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:26,235
Give me 5 bucks. No. Sorry. Don.

474
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,459
Can I help you gentlemen?

475
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:33,584
Swordfish.

476
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,503
And who are you here to see?

477
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,782
You can't do that now.
I just gave you the money.

478
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:41,800
Come on. Do we look like cops?

479
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,470
Sir?

480
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:47,618
I have a very good friend...

481
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:49,819
I can't remember the guy's name.

482
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,186
How about if I give you our names?
I'm Dick Dollars,

483
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,332
this is Mike Moneybags,

484
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,858
and this... Tilden Katz.

485
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,322
Fine.

486
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,270
Here.

487
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,769
That's a 20.

488
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,457
Gentlemen.

489
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,208
- Is it Milwaukee?
- Yes, it is.

490
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:30,568
Son of a bitch.

491
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:50,125
The Chuck-a-luck.

492
00:31:57,723 --> 00:31:59,921
Going to need some cocktails.

493
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:04,174
Eh, isn't that
the champ back there?

494
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,967
For another couple of months.

495
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,763
You're crazy.
Nobody's going to beat him.

496
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:15,595
Loosen up. Everything's going
to be okay.

497
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,554
Just in time.

498
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,768
Canadian Club neat, Wolfschmidt gibson,
Granddad rocks.

499
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,530
Pete Campbell, huh?

500
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,285
I would have never thought
I was in his way.

501
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:36,485
You know, you bet badly.

502
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:39,334
- Obviously.
- No. I mean you win a few times,

503
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:40,776
you got to start really
putting it out there.

504
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,347
You kept betting the same thing.

505
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,694
You're so good at this,
why don't you quit your job?

506
00:32:47,771 --> 00:32:49,979
See? He's having a great time.

507
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:55,504
Hello, there.

508
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,704
Are we winners or losers?

509
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:01,740
Losers tonight,
but winners in general.

510
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:05,319
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.

511
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,151
- What do you think of that?
- I think I'm glad I'm not that kid.

512
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:16,899
I'm sorry. Can we get you
a drink or something?

513
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:18,019
No.

514
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:25,649
I'm sorry. Were you interested?

515
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,461
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

516
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,231
I know what's going on.

517
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:31,442
You come in too early.

518
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:34,273
You got dry cleaning moving in and out.
I can't remember the last time it was

519
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:36,149
you went out spur of the moment.

520
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:37,962
Send off Freddie,
I had to send off Freddie.

521
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,082
Come on.

522
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:42,155
I've been in your
particular situation.

523
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:44,649
I heard you chaired
the blood drive.

524
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:46,736
Where are you, the Stanhope?
The Biltmore?

525
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,962
- Did she kick you out? You leave?
- There's nothing to talk about.

526
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:51,932
Look, people make mistakes.

527
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,221
You feel bad about it.
You think things over,

528
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:56,882
and in the end you do
the grand gesture for her.

529
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,399
It'll be easy for you.
You're creative.

530
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,069
Roger, will you stop?

531
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,025
All I'm going to say is
do you want to be right,

532
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:04,336
or do you want to be married?

533
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:07,149
I know marriage isn't a natural state,
but you do it.

534
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,269
Why?

535
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:09,906
I don't know.

536
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:12,331
Kids.

537
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,330
Again!

538
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:18,336
And don't fool yourself.
There are other things.

539
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,406
Think about when you met her.

540
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:25,983
Okay. I'm sorry.
You're so secretive.

541
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,027
Look who's here.

542
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:34,185
If it isn't the man
in the gray flannel suit.

543
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:42,040
What the hell was that for?

544
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,872
We're going to go.

545
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:46,528
Don't worry about it.

546
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:49,660
I'm sure it's not the first time
he's been punched in the face.

547
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Floyd.

548
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:56,582
How'd I do?

549
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:05,340
I'm sure there are 20 people
who want to thank you for that.

550
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,610
It wasn't exactly a fair match-up.

551
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,184
I think that's going
to do it for me.

552
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:11,538
Me, too.

553
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:13,810
It's getting late.

554
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,991
This was a nice evening.
Hold on.

555
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:19,171
Don and I are going to
the East Side. You take it.

556
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:20,787
Absolutely.

557
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,687
I'd like to stay and get
all sentimental with you,

558
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:34,234
but I got to go and give
a Chinaman a music lesson.

559
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:38,112
Want to watch how I do it,
unzipping the fly and everything?

560
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,306
Go to hell.

561
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,742
Take him to McCann.

562
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:49,692
- This was fun.
- Good.

563
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,968
I'm going to miss you.

564
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:54,168
You're talented.

565
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:57,166
I don't know.

566
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,492
Thank you, Freddie.

567
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,139
It means a lot.

568
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,219
What am I going to do?

569
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,842
What am I going to tell Violet?

570
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:11,406
I don't know. It sounded like
you had a plan.

571
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,844
I'm not kidding, Don.

572
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,009
What am I going to do?

573
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:18,993
It's not an ending.

574
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,368
It's a fresh start.

575
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:26,635
If I don't go into
that office every day,

576
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,446
who am I?

577
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,207
Where do you live, Freddie?

578
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,199
152 Riverside Drive.

579
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,542
Apartment 604.

580
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,781
No matter what he says,
take him there.

581
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,547
Good night, Freddie.

582
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,800
Good-bye, Don.

583
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:12,702
See, I find if I stick
with the clear liquors...

584
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:14,909
vodka, gin... I know where I stand.

585
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:18,494
I'm the opposite.

586
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,415
So what do you think,
because you gave blood,

587
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,186
the whiskey made you
a little angry?

588
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:27,954
That was a real Archibald
Whitman maneuver.

589
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,333
Who's that?

590
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,526
This hothead drunk I used to know.

591
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,696
Jimmy Barrett's a weasel. Enjoy.

592
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,469
So what's going on with you?

593
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:47,716
I'm at the Roosevelt.

594
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,586
See? That wasn't so hard.

595
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:52,151
I really don't want to discuss it.

596
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,023
Why, because you feel so bad?
I've been there.

597
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:59,248
No, I don't feel bad at all.

598
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,344
I mean, sometimes...

599
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,393
Mostly, I'm just relieved.

600
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:10,457
Really?

601
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:13,966
Do you fall in love?

602
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,381
That would be easier.

603
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,520
Then I'd know what to do.

604
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Easier...

605
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,783
There's some incredible woman,

606
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:29,837
and someone's going to end up with her,
but it can't be you.

607
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:30,957
Why not?

608
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:35,318
Because we're married.

609
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:44,392
I don't know.

610
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:46,924
It's your life.

611
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,402
You don't know how long
it's going to be,

612
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,457
but you know it's got
a bad ending.

613
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:55,643
You have to move forward.

614
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:00,526
As soon as you figure out
what that is.

615
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:01,646
Two coronaries.

616
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,067
Got to move forward.

617
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,435
It's your life.

618
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,982
I mean, this can't be it, right?

619
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,113
We're in it together, huh?

620
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:39,116
That's true.

621
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,610
You wanted to see me?

622
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:49,010
Close the door.

623
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:03,184
That was quite
a presentation you gave.

624
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:05,486
The Samsonite people are thrilled.

625
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,256
That's good to hear.

626
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:09,709
They've requested
that you be reassigned

627
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,917
as the copywriter on their account.

628
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,684
What about Freddie?

629
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:17,293
Freddie's decided
to take a few months off.

630
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,794
He did? When's he coming back?

631
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:21,581
It doesn't matter.

632
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:24,174
You'll be taking over
all of his business.

633
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:28,765
Are you sure?

634
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,145
You know, I really don't like

635
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,587
walking into an ambush
from Duck and Pete Campbell.

636
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:36,603
I don't know why anyone
had to know about that.

637
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Even me?

638
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,044
No, of course you, but...

639
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:43,411
I just thought that...

640
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:46,030
I love Freddie.

641
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:47,894
What's your point?

642
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:51,327
Don't feel bad about
being good at your job.

643
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:56,498
I wish it hadn't happened this way.

644
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:01,082
That's the way it happened.

645
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,046
Congratulations.

646
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:33,795
- Miss Olsen...
- In a minute.

647
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:35,660
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

648
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:38,174
Do you know what you
did to Freddie Rumsen?

649
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:40,801
- For just cause.
- You didn't have to tell Don.

650
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:43,251
- You told on Mr. Rumsen?
- Do you mind?

651
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,331
It would have gotten out anyway.

652
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:52,313
Right, and he'd be some legend
in one of those stupid stories.

653
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:54,550
You remember the guy who wet
his pants before the big meeting?

654
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,932
Instead, he's finished.

655
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,864
Why do you feel bad for him?

656
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:00,809
Those people always blame
their problems on society.

657
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:03,613
He did it to himself.
Those people have no self-control.

658
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:05,686
If it wasn't for him,
I'd still be a secretary.

659
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:08,194
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a junior copywriter.

660
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:11,848
I refuse to feel bad.

661
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,701
We're going to get raises.
You could get his office.

662
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,175
Now, I'll go first.

663
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,457
Congratulations, Peggy.

664
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:26,296
Congratulations, Pete.

665
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,983
Good to see you.

666
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,484
This is me.

667
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,159
It's nice to see you.

668
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:43,866
- What are you doing here?
- Betty invited me for lunch,

669
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:46,258
but we're going to
need another place setting.

670
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,196
We're going to be three.

671
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:55,741
Betty didn't say
you'd be joining us.

672
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:57,611
I hope I'm not intruding.

673
00:42:58,046 --> 00:42:59,491
She thought it would be fun.

674
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:00,816
It will be.

675
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:03,898
It's just gotten
infinitely more fun.

676
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,812
I think I need whatever
you're having.

677
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:11,094
It's a gin and tonic.

678
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:12,592
Nothing special.

679
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,550
It's perfect.

680
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,050
Keep stirring.

681
00:43:26,112 --> 00:43:27,862
Bobby, go get two spoons.

682
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:45,120
So with Indian Point open now,

683
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,991
we should be able to use
even a modest safety record.

684
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:50,839
We were spitballing
about a cartoon turtle.

685
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,740
Kids... keeps it friendly
and nature-loving,

686
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,815
and then we just hammer
the Ravenswood area

687
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,385
until they're ready
for the next plant.

688
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:01,835
You on board with that?

689
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,183
Yes.

690
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,004
I want to see schedules,

691
00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:11,074
and I want to see this turtle.

692
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:21,161
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

693
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:27,542
- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Mona. Jane, it's okay.

694
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:35,759
- Just stop.
- What?

695
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,119
I don't even know
what to say to you.

696
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:41,441
About what?

697
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:43,161
Don't act innocent.

698
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,854
He's leaving me for his secretary.

699
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:51,303
He's in love, and you said
it was great.

700
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:52,984
Mona, I didn't say anything.

701
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,815
"It's your life."

702
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:57,488
"You have to move forward."

703
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,703
- Mona, I didn't mean it that way.
- 25 years of marriage.

704
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:12,712
- I want you to calm down.
- Don't make me make a scene.

705
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:16,549
- We should talk about this.
- You can talk to Margaret.

706
00:45:40,877 --> 00:45:43,452
Listen, Don, I can explain.

707
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:45,904
I want her off my desk.
