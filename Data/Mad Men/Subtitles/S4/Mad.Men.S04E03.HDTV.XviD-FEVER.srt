This is the one.

00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:08,169
Who is she?

6
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,986
She's the soul of the world.

8
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,594
The only thing keeping
you from being happy

9
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,451
is the belief that
you are alone.

10
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,233
Do you miss London?

11
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:20,042
God, yes.

12
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,169
Stop telling what to do,
I know what you want.

13
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:23,707
So do it.

when did you stop
taking the pills?

20
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:14,149
They ran out on the 2nd.

21
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:16,553
I'd say I would
expect to be fertile again
at the end of the cycle,

22
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,690
Although from my experience
it's more likely a month.

23
00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:20,893
All this time
I've been afraid to skip one

24
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:24,634
- But it could take a month?
- Why don't you join him
for basic training?

25

San Antonio is lovely

I didn't have
a choice or a wife.

40
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,890
You know I've had
a couple of procedures.

41
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,093
I just want to make sure
they don't affect anything.

42

I only remember one.

43

There was one before that.

44
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,569
Should I be worried?

45
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,807
Was the other performed
by a physician?

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,811
She said she was a midwife.

47
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,915
Well, you got pregnant

everything looks fine.

running out of gas

- Am I interrupting?
- No.

69

I'll see you

this afternoon.

We're still
doing that? Why?

71

00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:43,248
I'm sure another day
and a half of work

75
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,750
Will not come close
to the amount

76
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,252

in Los Angeles this year.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,553
Okay.

probably Times Square.

- We can do it now.

we're here anyway.

that all men are dizzy

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,572
Or she'll spend the night.
You can get her
in the morning.

173
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,810
Okay, you figure it out.
Good night, sweetheart.

174
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:12,246
You know I'm very grateful.

175
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:14,748
If I don't see you,
dick, happy new year.

176
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:15,983
Happy new year.

177
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:20,720
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

178
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:22,889
I'm going to wash
the road off me,

179
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:25,425
And then we are
going to that place
with the beer and abalone.

180
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,627
Perfect.
Sounds like there's
towels all over the bed.

181
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,865
- Why am I staying?
- I wanted him to meet you

182
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,833
And I know you've got grass.

183
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,902
( sighs )

184
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,770
Hello.

185
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:45,139
Ah. Come over here.

186
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,177
- Is that your dinner?
- I love your chicken.

187
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:51,746
- ( giggles )
- ( kisses )

188
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,981
- How was the doctor?
- Everything's good.

189
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,185
Good.
I have to go.

190
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,153
Let me at least heat it up.

191
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,687
You can take it with you.

192
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:06,090
Peabody's offered
his place in the Poconos
for the 14th and 15th.

193
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,824
Greg, I can't
get away, not then.

194
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,692
Joanie, I have
to work new year's.

195
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,360
I had to trade it for January.

196
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,462
Then get one of
the Jewish docs to do it.

197
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,630
- You worked
on their holiday.
- Joanie...

198
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,400
You don't think
I'd rather be smelling
perfume than Lysol?

199
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,901
Tell me what you want me to do.

200
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,870
I guess it's not
your problem too.

201
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:27,340
Why don't you just not show up?

202
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,709
- I'll lose my job.
- We'll make it.

203
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,210
- Until when?
- Until I leave for basic,

204
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,413
And then it's just
a couple of weeks
and then I'll be home.

205
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,582
And then you're
going to Vietnam.

206
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,718
- We don't know that.
- Oh, that makes me
feel better.

207
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:41,886
Just keep marking off
the days on the calendar

208
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:43,921
While keep planning
for our future.

209
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,356
I'll see you tomorrow
when you're on your way out.

210
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,895
- You don't even know
when you're going!
- Soon.

211
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,767
<i>- ( music playing )

the worst roommate.</i>

212
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:02,736
She had a nervous breakdown.

213
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,972
One morning she's
reading the bible

214
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,507
<i>Instead
of her psych book.</i>

215
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,975
The next morning
she woke me up,

216
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,877
Leaning over me
with this crazy smile,

217
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:15,446
And said, "morning, Stephanie.

218
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,148
Have you heard
the good news?"

219
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,982
- There are worse things.
- ( don chuckling )

220
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,518
- No, there aren't.

221
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:24,253

A self-made man.

226
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:38,232
What's it like
taking off your suit
and returning to the wild?

227
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,734
I really don't
like how political
you're getting.

228
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,502
I'm not political.

229
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,338
I just don't understand
who's in charge.

230
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,374
You're in charge.

231
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,342
Trust me.
I work in advertising.

232
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,444
You're kidding me.
It's pollution.

233
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,279
So stop buying things.

234
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,815
Don't think
that's not possible.

And ask each other questions?

315
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,746

- It's why
she broke her leg.

342
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,171
It's in her bones.
It's all over her body.

343
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,740
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:56,350
Cancer. Shit.

345
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,218
I'm so sorry.

346
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,821
Of course she's not
gonna say a damn thing.

347
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,723
She doesn't know.

348
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,995
- What?
- The doctors said

349
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:12,432
She doesn't have long,
so there's no reason
to tell her.

350
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:16,202
Some quacks out in Pedro?
What are you going
to do about it?

351
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,604
My mom got a consultation.

352
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:21,139
Your mother does not
get to decide that.

353
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:24,408
Please don't make me sorry
that I told you.

354
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,746
I didn't want you to leave here

355
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:31,547
And not know.

356
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:37,152
<i>( door opens )</i>

357
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:41,455
( door closes )

358
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,160
( sighs )

359
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:45,239
( lighter flicks )

360
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,013
<i>( door closes )</i>

361
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,116
Good morning.

362
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:37,650
I woke up in a panic

363
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,719
Because I thought
I might've missed you.

364
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:42,389
But it doesn't look
like you're ready to go.

365
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,991
I thought I'd stay
a little longer
if it's okay.

366
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,293
Hell yes.
Stay as long
as you want.

367
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:49,461
We'll see.

368
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,962
If I had rolled over on this,

369
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,395
I would've had
to smoke the dress.

370
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,903
How'd you sleep?

371
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,173
I was feeling no pain,
as they say.

372
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,308
In fact, I don't know
if I would've woken up

373
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,210
If I hadn't heard
that jet fly by.

374
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,378
And I thought, "oh my god.
Dick left already."

375
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:23,716
There's all kinds
of aircraft here, you know.

376
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,552
If we stay up tonight
and we get lucky,

377
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,021
We'll see something
you'll remember.

378
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,790
( chuckles )
if we keep smoking that.

379
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,328
I've seen u.F.O.S.

380
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,796
There was a lot going on
during the missile scare,

381
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,665
But it was different.

382
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,800
You saw a u.F.O.?

383
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,568
Mm-hmm. You don't have
to do that, you know.

384
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,204
I want to.

385
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,573
I'm not gonna fight
watching dick Whitman

386
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,541
Paint my living room
in his shorts.

387
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,081
I'm so damn proud of you.

388
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,017
I count on that.

389
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:08,588
Does that scare you?

390
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,923
The idea
of another civilization
on another planet

391
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,691
Smart enough to find
a way to get here?

392
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,259
It doesn't scare me,

393
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:17,228
But the odds are against it.

394
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,363
<i>Well, I saw
something once</i>

395
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,832
And I'm telling you
it knocked me sideways.

396
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,035
I started thinking
of everything I was
sure was true

397
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,673
And how flimsy it all might be.

398
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,975
You don't need to see
a u.F.O. To know that.

399
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,677
That's not a great way
to think about things.

400
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:48,486
<i>I know everything
about you</i>

401
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:51,155
And I still love you.

402
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:57,160
Are you just gonna
paint that corner?

403
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:59,461
'cause a patch
of new paint is just
as bad as a stain.

404
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,965
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

405
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,636
<i>Patty:
What the hell
is going on?</i>

406
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,471
- You're gonna get arrested.
- No, you are.

407
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,907
- That's breaking and entering.
- I thought you had
a flight to catch.

408
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,775
I changed my plans.

409
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:19,845
You just can't keep
your pants on, can you?

410
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>( slams door )</i>

411
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:28,319
You never know what's
gonna set her off.

412
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,623
<i>( door closes )</i>

413
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,794
- I need to talk to you.
- I bet.

414
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,262
I heard you car
pull up at 2:30.

415
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,297
- She's half your age.
- What's your plan?

416
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:44,666
Just gonna let her
wake up one day in agony
and you tell her it's over?

417
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:50,538
<i>I'm going to assume
that you've done everything</i>

418
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:52,840
In your limited means,
but I'm here now.

419
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:54,575
She's gonna see
some real doctors

420
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,310
And she's not gonna
live in the dark.

421
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:59,279
We showed the x-rays
to specialists... everybody.

422
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:03,249
- It's very advanced.
- Specialists?

423
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,885
- You don't think she knows
something's going on?
- She had polio.

424
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:07,586
She's been going to doctors
since she was eight.

425
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,721
Maybe... I don't know.

426
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,124
She hasn't let on,
so this is the way
it's gonna be.

427
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,860
I understand
you feel guilty,
but don't.

428
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,162
Go to Acapulco.
There's nothing
for you to do here.

429
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:21,497
<i>She is very
important to me.</i>

430
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,599
I'm gonna do what I have to.

431
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,334
You have no say
in the affairs
of this family.

432
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,369
You're just a man in a room

433
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:31,104
With a checkbook.
I'm sorry.

434
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,848
Please do the decent thing.

435
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,351
The longer you're here,

436
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,953
The more likely you are
to say something.

437
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,309
She thinks you brought
the pot, I bet.

438
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,144
If it wasn't for my niece,

439
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,247
We'd have killed
each other by now.

440
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,051
She means well
and she's family.

441
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:11,719
I wouldn't have picked her.

442
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,723
I'm just saying

443
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,260
Not everybody has that.

444
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:21,230
You have your kids.

445
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:22,865
I bet that's better.

446
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:24,933
It's different.

447
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,609
I have to tell you something.

448
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,344
What's wrong?

449
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:48,119
I have to go.

450
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,557
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:00,063
I... I thought
I could stay,
but I can't.

452
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,898
Oh, I don't care.

453
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:04,001
I want you to.

454
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,703
I want you
to do everything
you want to do.

455
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:10,607
I'll bring the kids
out at Easter.

456
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,443
We'll go to Catalina,
see the bison.

457
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,152
Acapulco.

458
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,253
Do you think
there's more Mexicans
here or there?

459
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:35,710
<i>(Peggy) Joan.</i>

460
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:37,278
Open it.

461
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,053
They're beautiful.

462
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:53,592
It's so encouraging
to see someone happily
married around here.

463
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,694
Peggy, why don't you go home?

464
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:58,029
- I'll tell everyone you have
something important to do.
- Really?

465
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,396
- I have to buy a dress.
- Oh.

466
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,198
New year's eve,
big group of girls,

467
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,167
- You'll want to stand out.
- No, I'm spending it with mark.

468
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,535
My boyfriend?

469
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,969
( angrily ) happy new year.

470
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,672
Excuse me.

471
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,275
"darling, I've been an ass.

472
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,011
- Kisses, lane"?
- What?

473
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,449
I am not your darling
and I don't want your kisses.

474
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,686
- What?
- I thought American men
were bad enough,

475
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:22,922
But none of them has
ever so consistently

476
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,857
Made me feel
like a helpless,
stupid little girl.

477
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,192
Calm down.
I did send you flowers,

478
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,794
But I also sent flowers
to my wife in London.

479
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:32,162
The sentiments
were very different,
I assure you. Sandy!

480
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,634
Um, is everything okay?

481
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,135
- Yes.
- Just get back to work.

482
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:40,369
Sandy!

483
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:45,539
Did it ever occur
to you how sensitive
these deliveries were?

484
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,541
How often do I send flowers?

485
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:50,276
I ordered the flowers
from Rhinelander's.

486
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,779
They assured me
they were going to contact
your florist in London,

487
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,381
And somehow
they mixed them up.
It's not my fault.

488
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,750
Sandra,
everyone makes mistakes,

489
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:01,385
But the fact that you're
the kind of person who cannot
accept blame is egregious.

490
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,121
I don't know what that means.

491
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,087
It means I can't believe
I hired you.

492
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,792
<i>You had one simple task.</i>

493
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:13,761
I don't even know
if I can call to apologize.

494
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,863
What exactly did
Mrs. Harris's note say?

495
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,133
It said, "Joan,
forgive me. Lane."

496
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,070
You're fired.
Go get your things.

497
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,604
You'll be paid through
the end of the year.

498
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,974
Those instructions
you understood!

499
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,244
I'll have Megan clean this up.

500
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,651
- What are you doing?
- You inspired me.

501
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,320
Would you like
to sign your work?

502
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:48,756
- Really?
- Pick a spot on the wall.

503
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:57,063
Ah.

504
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,199
You should swim as much
as you can there.

505
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,200
It'll clear your head.

506
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,868
And no cliff diving.

507
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:09,974
( tisks )

508
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,491
Hey.
You'll be fine.

509
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:28,128
You'll make the best of it.

510
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,495
You always do.

511
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,467
You know you can call me
if you need anything.

512
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,845
- Goodbye, Anna.
- Goodbye, dick.

513
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,154
<i>Woman:
Mr. Draper?</i>

514
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,955
Mr. Draper?

515
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,393
Happy new year.

516
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,062
Happy new year.

517
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:18,272
- ( door closes )
- hey, what are you doing up?

518
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,374
I figured since
we missed it here,

519
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:22,376
We could celebrate it
in Hawaii.

520
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, look at that.

521
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:31,683
I'm sorry.
I ate dinner at 3:00.

522
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:34,185
A bowl of cottage cheese
in the cafeteria?

523
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,756
How about a glass
of fresh-squeezed
orange juice?

524
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:43,261
Sure. The nurses
spent five minutes

525
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,530
Trying to get this girl's
contact lenses out.

526
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:47,999
She was screaming.
It turns out

527
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,201
Her friend was the one
with the contact lenses.

528
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:52,135
Oh! God!

529
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,038
Oh God.

530
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:56,973
- Let me see.
- I cut it really bad, Greg.

531
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:57,941
- It really hurts.
- Jesus.

532
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:00,209
( whimpers )

533
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,878
- Hold this.
- ( breathes heavily )

534
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,346
Just take me to the hospital.

535
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,878
Sit down.

536
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:18,649
- Greg, you don't
have to do this.
- Would you stop?

537
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,754
Isn't there some
medical ethical law

538
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,089
- Against operating
on your wife?
- ( chuckles )

539
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:34,562
Ah!

540
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,731
Ah! Ow.

541
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,066
I want you to calm down.

542
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:43,469
For me, this is like...

543
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,839
I don't know...
filing some papers
is for you.

544
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,173
I do it all the time.

545
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,409
I don't do that anymore.
I have other people do that.

546
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,744
It's really throbbing.
Let me get my coat.

547
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:56,380
Hey, since when have
we had that bird's
nest on the ceiling?

548
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,015
Ah!

549
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,884
I usually save that for kids.

550
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,488
Now don't move.

551
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,728
One hillbilly says
to the other,

552
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,597
"you wanna play
20 questions?"

553
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,001
The other hillbilly says,
"what is that?"

554
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,903
He says, "I write something

555
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,972
On a piece of paper,

556
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,174
"And you get 20 questions
to guess what it be."

557
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,511
So he takes out
a piece of paper

558
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:31,346
And writes "donkey damn" on it.

559
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:35,416
The other hillbilly takes
a second to think and asks,

560
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:37,384
"can you eat it?"

561
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,620
The other hillbilly says,

562
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,221
"I might reckon
you could."

563
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,357
The other one says,

564
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,225
"is it donkey damn?"

565
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:52,463
Cohen told me that.

566
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,370
- Aw, come on. It's fine.
- ( sniffling )

567
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,838
I'm not crying 'cause it hurts.

568
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,940
Everything's gonna be okay.

569
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,808
When?

570
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:12,845
Joanie.

571
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:23,786
I can't fix anything else,

572
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:26,856
But I can fix this.

573
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:35,330
( keys rattle )

574
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,072
Hello?

575
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,640
<i>Lane: Hello?</i>

576
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:52,776
I thought you were in Acapulco.

577
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:56,714
I didn't feel like it.

578
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,649
You should be in England
with your family.

579
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,885
Oh, too much to do.

580
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,453
They'll be back soon enough.

581
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,822
I have a sandwich
in the refrigerator.

582
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,257
It's very large.

583
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,825
No thank you.

584
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:11,194
- Do you mind?
- Help yourself.

585
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,700
<i>( drawer opens )</i>

586
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:22,004
<i>- ( drawer closes )
- I received something</i>

587
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,907
Rather special
from my father
for my birthday.

588
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:28,042
- What is it?
- Who knows?

589
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,977
<i>- ( pops )
- ( liquid sloshing )</i>

590
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,946
He's one of those alcoholics

591
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,547
Who thinks
that he's collecting.

592
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,948
( chuckles )

593
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:37,116
<i>( bottle thunks )</i>

594
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,051
- Chin-chin.
- ( clinks )

595
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,355
- There's no...
- no bite at all.

596
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,126

599
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,302
- Ah.
- I made a discovery

600
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,175
As I slowly pulled back
from the records.

601
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:10,115
I can't take
any more bad news, lane.

602
00:35:12,352 --> 00:35:15,153
Although things are
precarious financially,

603
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,123
It's been a magnificent year.

604
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:30,832
<i>( don shouts )
lane!</i>

605
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,667
( shouts ) what?

606
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,268
<i>Come here.</i>

607
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,409
We're going to the movies.

608
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,847
Do you think we should?

609
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:49,882
Does howdy doody
have a wooden dick?

610
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,553
"zorba the Greek"...
seen it, but would
see it again.

611
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,922
"it's a mad mad mad world."

612
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,423
No kidding.

613
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,527
- "send me no flowers."
- no.

614
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,562
( splashing )

615
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:07,129
<i>Lane:
"the guns of August."</i>

616
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:10,031
I hate guns and I hate August.

617
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,801
It's all over the rug.

618
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,869
We'll have to smoke the dress.

619
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:19,605
I don't know that one.

620
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,241
"the umbrellas
of Cherbourg."

621
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,577
Catherine Deneuve.

622
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,712
Apparently it's for
all the young lovers
of the world.

623
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,547
( movie playing )

624
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:40,153
This movie is very good.

625
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:45,958
You know what's
going on here, don't you?

626
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,795
- Handjobs.
- Is that right?

627
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,897
Shh!

628
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,831
What percentage do you think?

629
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:56,432
Do you mind?

630
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,133
( speaks mock Japanese )

631
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,635
- Monster!
- ( both laughing )

632
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,909
You like it here.

633
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,577
I do. I do.

634
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,611
Even alone.

635
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:15,617
You remind me of a chap
I knew in school.

636
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,088
We followed him around
in a pack

637
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,390
And he didn't notice
we were there.

638
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:25,994
He died in a motorcycle crash.

639
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,532
Mmm.
Rebecca convinced me

640
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,567
That you were all
on holiday together...

641
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,835
Without me.

642
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:39,571
I suppose we haven't
been very welcoming.

643
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,406
Campbell's friendly,

644
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:44,542
Although I believe
unintentionally.

645
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:48,845
But my wife is
quite severe with people,

646
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,380
Including me.

647
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:53,682
I'm sorry to hear that.

648
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:57,352
I, um...

649
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,521
I wanted to bring our families

650
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:02,990
To New York for the holidays,

651
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:05,425
But she was terribly homesick.

652
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,828
We had an argument...

653
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,929
A series of arguments...

654
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,731
And she left.

655
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,133
I then weakened
and sent her flowers.

656
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:19,335
Huh.
Tried to, anyway.

657
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,237
Then we had a rather
solemn phone call

658
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:27,239
In which she told me
she was not returning.

659
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,476
Then she put
my son on the phone.

660
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:38,279
That's tough.

661
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,783
How did you know
when you were done?

662
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:46,887
It wasn't my decision.

663
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,726
And I've learned the hard way

664
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:53,297
Not to give advice
in these situations.

665
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:57,537
You were
supposed to tell me
to get on a plane.

666
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:01,307
Is that what you want?

667
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,742
Or is that what
people expect of you?

668
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,913
I want my beef.

669
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:11,382
Ah. Here it is.

670
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,456
( sniffs )

671
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,726
I, uh,

672
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,027
Was going to call
a lady friend of mine.

673
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:26,561
I'm supposed
to meet her downtown.

674
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:31,364
Do you want her
to bring a friend?

675
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,301
Oh, no no.
No thank you.

676
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:36,835
What are you gonna do?

677
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:40,372
We can pretend it's new year's.

678
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,640
It actually is.

679
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,282
If you don't mind.

680
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,884
It's the least I can do.

681
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:06,094
- I'm not hungry.
- What? Not hungry

682
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:08,029
For this...

683
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:10,765
- Beautiful piece
of American meat?
- ( chuckles )

684
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,902
( yells )

685
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,739
I got a big Texas belt buckle!

686
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:21,907
<i>- Yeehaw!
- ( people laughing )</i>

687
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,112
I'm thinking,
"did my mother get suspicious
and call the fuzz?"

688
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,614
"we know you're
practicing self-abuse.

689
00:40:29,682 --> 00:40:31,549
Please come out
with your hand up."

690
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,255
Aw. I see we have
an anniversary
here tonight.

691
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:44,360
Look at these two...
George and Martha.

692
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:46,661
( people laugh )

693
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:49,798
Tell me, what's it like
when your eyes meet across
a crowded men's room?

694
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,103
Wall street,
does it bother your parents
that he's so ugly?

695
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:57,839
Audience: Ooh.

696
00:40:57,906 --> 00:41:00,441
So we all want to know:
At the end of the night

697
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,944
When it's just
the two of you,
who picks up the check?

698
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:07,114
We're not homosexuals!
We're divorced!

699
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:08,983
- ( people laugh )
- don't.

700
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:12,487
Oh man. Now they're
gonna fight in the car
all the way home.

701
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,756
"honey, why'd you provoke
the comedian?"

702
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,128
Okay, now welcome
a talented young musician

703
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:22,830
Whose mother says
he's the next Bob Dylan.

704
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:27,167
- ( whistles )
- man: Yeah.

705
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,640
Candice, this is lane.

706
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,042
And this is my friend Janine.

707
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,276
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

708
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:38,445
I guess I was wrong.
You're not queers.

709
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,981
- You're rich.
- ( people laugh )

710
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:42,649
<i>Comedian:
A warm welcome
for Rudy Jenson.</i>

711

( "house of
the rising sun" playing )

712
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,994
- You ladies look lovely.
- Why thank you.

713
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,896
It's true.

714
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,132
I love this song.

715
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,000
Really?
He wrote it.

716
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:02,768
Don't.
She'll believe anything.

717
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,937
<i>- What?
- ( laughs )</i>

718
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:06,471
Let's get out of here.

719
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,647
You have no mixers
at all and no food.

720
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:18,149
I love your apartment.

721
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:19,850
It's very manly.

722
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,818
It came this way.

723
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:25,120
I think Norman mailer
shot a deer over there.

724
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:29,323
I love deer.

725
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:31,191
Get your tail
in here and help me.

726
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,199
( whispering )
she seems to know her way
around in your kitchen.

727
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,234
What's that like?

728
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:43,802
( whispering )
I told you I don't like

729
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,237
Giving advice
in these situations.

730
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:51,809
Why don't you show me around?

731
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:55,580
I suppose I am
a bit curious myself.

732
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:01,719
Not in there.

733
00:43:57,881 --> 00:44:00,115
What happened to Acapulco?

734
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,218
She does not go to Barnard.

735
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:07,054
( laughs )

736
00:44:08,394 --> 00:44:10,197
Guys like him like that.

737
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,111
Come on. Let's go
in the other room.

738
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:17,849
No. Here.

739
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:28,525

741

- Morning.
- Morning.

742
00:44:40,632 --> 00:44:42,699
I'm terribly thirsty.

743
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,101
We'll have coffee in a minute.

744
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:46,901
Just a glass of water, please.

745
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:55,841
What do I owe you
for the evening?

746
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,947
- Don't worry about it.
- I should pay.

747
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:05,050
The girl...
how much was she?

748
00:45:05,118 --> 00:45:06,985
$25.

749
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:12,321
Fascinating.

750
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:14,656
Here's $30.

751
00:45:23,864 --> 00:45:26,665
Well, I shall be running along.

752
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:44,047

the welcome distraction.</i>

( clears throat ) sorry.

758
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,451
All right. Gentlemen,
shall we begin 1965?
