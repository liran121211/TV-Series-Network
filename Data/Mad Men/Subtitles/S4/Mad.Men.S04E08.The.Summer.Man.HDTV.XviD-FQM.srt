1
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,652
They say as soon as you have
to cut down on your drinking

2
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,387
you have a drinking problem.

3
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,759
My mind is a jumble.

4
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,828
I can't organize my thoughts

5
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:32,497
and typing feels like work.

6
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,901
I've never written
more than 250 words,

7
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,737
not even in high school...

8
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:41,706
Five paragraphs, 50 words apiece.

9
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,742
God, I was lazy.

10
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,412
I should've finished high school.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,547
Everything could
have been different.

12
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,464
Are you okay, sir?

13
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,086
Summer's coming.

14
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,254
I smelled it.

15
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,957
I kind of thought I smelled corn,
which is impossible.

16
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,494
There it was again.

17
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,063
Perfume.

18
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,946
Morning, miss blankenship.

19
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,848
How was your surgery?

20
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,683
It was a nightmare...

21
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,752
The ether and the blindness...

22
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,286
And then I got the goggles.

23
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,955
So everything's good?

24
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,257
I'll tell you... I was blind

25
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,926
- and now I see.
- Well, good.

26
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,928
- If you need more time...
- I'm fine, Roger.

27
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,931
I'm kidding around here.

28
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,467
My book's at home.

29
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,137
Can you give me the number
for a Bethany van Nuys?

30
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,344
May... maybe lift it
up and drop it down.

31
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,881
I'm stronger than you,
but I'm not that strong.

32
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,949
Stop stop....

33
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,285
- He's right.
- I feel like Margaret mead.

34
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,387
You know what,
Harry? I think this is a show.

35
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,356
Okay, we're gonna do it.

36
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,857
Harry, get out of the way.

37
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:22,066
What is going on out here?

38
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,068
I don't know.

39
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:26,037
I got blockaded on my way
back from the men's room.

40
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,939
Thank you, gentlemen....

41
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,909
- Everyone back to work.
- It took my watch.

42
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,344
- What?
- Ken was buying a Clark bar...

43
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:34,681
But it ate my change, and since

44
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,114
Danny's not here, we went to Peggy.

45
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,183
But it turns out Joey's
got the smallest hands.

46
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,651
No, I said I had done it before.

47
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:41,820
Why don't you put another
dime in the machine

48
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:43,655
- and pull again?
- Do you really think we didn't try that?

49
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:45,023
- This thing is a bandit.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,457
Cut it out!

51
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,026
Don't make me come out here again.

52
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,661
Sorry, mom.

53
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,329
Pardon?

54
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,364
Okay. Hey, it's over.

55
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,133
I'm trying to get my watch.
What am I supposed to do?

56
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,036
Call the complaint number.
Have an adult solve this problem.

57
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,771
What is going on out here?

58
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,739
I was in the midst of an extremely
important telephone call.

59
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,242
Joan was just handing
out demerits....

60
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,945
Joey, in my office.

61
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:08,913
- Oh.
- Go easy on him.

62
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,549
A private spanking...
just like my dre dream.

63
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,618
When did we get a vending machine?

64
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,358
I know you're a freelancer and
you spend time in other offices,

65
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,727
but you should know this
behavior is not tolerated here.

66
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,762
- Yes, ma'am.
- I should let you know

67
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,331
there's a problem now between us.

68
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:27,665
Why are you always on my case?

69
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,901
Because you are
particularly disrespectful.

70
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,170
No, I'm not. Stan'sse.

71
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:35,206
Maybe he's better at his job.

72
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,776
I'm glad you're amused.

73
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:41,379
You're so arrogant.

74
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,982
Me? What do you do around here

75
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,984
besides walking around like
you're trying to get raped?

76
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,952
Excuse me?

77
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,954
I'm not some young
girl off the bus.

78
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,322
I don't need some
madam from a Shanghai

79
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,390
whorehouse to show me the ropes.

80
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,598
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were in here.

81
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,001
Where the hell else would I be?
This is my office.

82
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,470
And you all better stop
cutting through here.

83
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,105
It's not a thoroughfare.

84
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,741
Take the extra steps.
You could use them.

85
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:12,477
You're right.

86
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,282
Go ahead. I'm leaving anyway.

87
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,162
Oh no.

89
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,967
Oh, miss blankenship,
good to see you.

90
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,469
I mean, nice to see you.
I mean, welcome back.

91
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:42,006
- Let me help you with those.
- Finally, someone offers.

92
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:46,377
I told you I can see
with the glasses.

93
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,914
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- I've got your liquor.

94
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:52,417
I only have two hands.

95
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:56,587
- I'm set.
- And then you're not.

96
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,256
Take those back to the storeroom,

97
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,258
and while you're there
get me some cigarettes.

98
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,160
Your wife called earlier.

99
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:05,596
- She's not my wife.
- Mrs. Francis said to remind you

100
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,366
that you can't have the kids this weekend.
It's very complicated.

101
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,034
It's Bobby's birthday party Sunday.

102
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:11,803
It's gene's birthday.

103
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,472
Did you want me to buy
him or her a gift?

104
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:16,741
No.

105
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,997
What a pleasant surprise.

106
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:56,381
You don't mind that I'm
home early, do you?

107
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,416
You said you didn't
want watch me pack.

108
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:00,952
You don't even want to say goodbye.

109
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,653
I don't.

110
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:06,858
Joanie, it's basic training.
I'll be back.

111
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:09,694
You said they use live ammunition.

112
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:15,700
Come on. Come in here.

113
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,877
Greg, that doesn't
make everything better.

114
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,513
- It makes it worse.
- It's eight weeks.

115
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,148
I'm gonna come back in uniform.

116
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,549
You know you'll like that.

117
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,721
What am I gonna do?
Who am I gonna talk to?

118
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,191
Well, you'll talk to
your friends at work.

119
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,906
Is this the way you want
to spend this time, crying?

120
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:07,752
- I can't.
- Mmm, sure you can.

121
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,289
Just pretend we're
in some midtown hotel

122
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,692
and we both snuck away
for the afternoon.

123
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,818
More and more every
day about Vietnam.

124
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,654
I hope it's not another Korea.

125
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,624
I sound like a little girl,

126
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,192
writing down what happened today.

127
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:55,099
Sunday is gene's birthday party.

128
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,136
I know I can't go.

129
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,104
I keep thinking about him.

130
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,108
He was conceived in a
moment of desperation

131
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:06,644
and born into a mess.

132
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,165
One,

133
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,300
climb mount Kilimanjaro...

134
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:32,136
Go anywhere in Africa, actually;

135
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:35,406
two, gain a modicum

136
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,074
of control over the way I feel.

137
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,045
I want to wake up

138
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,115
and I want to be that man.

139
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,256
Could you get that to el Jefe?

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,197
So mountain dew... everything
kind of fell apart there.

141
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,166
- They don't like the work.
- Too bad.

142
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,168
Well, somebody showed a
couple of bottlers the work

143
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,771
and they don't like
witches brewing things.

144
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,906
They don't like the
occult in general.

145
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:11,709
And you told them it's their
hillbilly working a still?

146
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:13,611
I did, but the fact remains

147
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,379
that in the world of sodie pop

148
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:17,682
Pepsi is the tail and the
bottlers are the dog.

149
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:19,016
They just want us to
change the drawing.

150
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,587
Except it's damaged goods.

151
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,055
They're never gonna want
to see that board again.

152
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:26,657
- Start over.
- I did it with Joey.

153
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,326
Do you want Stan to take over?

154
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:31,162
You're spreading me awful thin.

155
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,830
Do you want me to tell
Joan to figure it out?

156
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,766
"It"? You don't even
know what "it" is.

157
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,002
Miss blankenship, get Joan in here.

158
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,937
She startles when you do that.

159
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:43,975
I had an uncle who was blind.

160
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,744
She's not blind. She's
recovering from cataract surgery.

161
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,843
He would come in the room
and he would say......

162
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,916
- What can I do for you?
- A redo on mountain dew.

163
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:28,719
I want to make Joey full
time for a couple of weeks.

164
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:32,390
I'd have to double-check
on his availability,

165
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,158
but are you sure
he's the right fit?

166
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:37,595
He did the first round.
And we're redoing it.

167
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,463
It's more complicated than that.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,685
Well, this may not be the time or

169
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,770
the place to bring this up but...

170
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,339
- What now?
- ...I've been hearing complaints about him.

171
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:52,209
- Really?
- He's not a gentleman with the girls.

172
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:55,112
Okay. One juicy story?

173
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,348
I'll protect those concerned

174
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,917
but it involves an
extremely blue joke.

175
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:02,620
- When?
- It doesn't matter.

176
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:04,255
Fine, you can tell it to me later.

177
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:06,524
Of course,

178
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:09,727
but I'm going to call in other books.
There's too much to do.

179
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,702
- Are we done?
- Sure.

180
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,477
Can you tell ray Charles to
come in here and clean this up?

181
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:30,981
And as soon as you
get to Hollywood,

182
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,750
you find out that that myth is...

183
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,585
Well, it had some truth to it.

184
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,287
There is instant fame.

185
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,456
What's this have to do with
"Peyton place"?

186
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:40,324
Well, we went down to the set

187
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:42,860
and Ryan was doing this scene
against another rival...

188
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,629
I can't tell you who...
and the guy was awful.

189
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,165
I start to hear him talk
about a young fresh face,

190
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,800
wholesome but a little mischievous.

191
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,702
Am I crazy?

192
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,605
I don't understand.
You want to be an actor?

193
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:57,708
Does that sound like me? That's you.
You could do it.

194
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:00,077
I know the right people...
maybe not the big screen,

195
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,812
but the small screen definitely.

196
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,848
I'm kind of down to earth.

197
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:07,685
You're so handsome.
I showed them a picture.

198
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:09,987
How'd you get a picture?

199
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,617
I sent one of those
polaroids from the

200
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,057
Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.

201
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,526
Mr. crane, I hate to interrupt you,

202
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:18,429
but I have Peggy Olson out
here looking for Mr. baird.

203
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,933
Well, thank you for thinking of me.

204
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,702
You're too modest, you know that?

205
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,040
What were you doing in there?

206
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:32,009
Everyplace I've worked
there's always some old fairy

207
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:33,778
who comes onto me,
but that was the weirdest by far.

208
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,813
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.

209
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,516
- It happens a lot.
- What did you do to Joan?

210
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,218
- I told her off.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

211
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,026
- She's important around here.
- Let me

212
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,722
tell you something
about the big ragu.

213
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,025
We're creative and she's
an overblown secretary.

214
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,693
Fine, don't listen to me.

215
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,629
There's a Joan in every company.

216
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,464
My mother was a Joan,

217
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:55,366
always telling
everybody what to do.

218
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:56,854
She even wore a pen around her neck

219
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,235
so people would stare at her tits.

220
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,206
She's not your mother, and she and
Lane basically run this place.

221
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:04,775
Okay, message received.

222
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:08,679
Ugh, is it time to go yet?

223
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,180
Glad you could make it.

224
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,582
Well, we were on our way
to the theater anyway.

225
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,618
Ralph Stuben,
this is my wife Betty.

226
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,154
- Pleased to meet you.
- I hope you don't mind.

227
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:30,390
The Congressman wanted
me to do this immediately

228
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,292
and he didn't want me
to do it over the phone.

229
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,227
She doesn't mind,

230
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,262
and she's very discreet.

231
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,331
That's the curse of
a political wife...

232
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,725
That and having to eat dinner with

233
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,934
a lot of people you don't know.

234
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,336
Betty's no stranger
to public service.

235
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,944
- So what show did you see?
- Why

236
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,439
don't we get a drink at the bar?

237
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,344
It'll only be a minute.

238
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:56,149
Thank you.

239
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:03,656
So are you a Felix or an Oscar?

240
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,825
Like most men I'd
rather be an Oscar,

241
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,027
but I'm probably a Felix....

242
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:12,131
Every date feels like
a first date with you.

243
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,133
Is that good or bad?

244
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,769
It's just I know you must
be seeing someone else.

245
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:19,172
And don't say no,
because it'll just hurt me more.

246
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:23,710
Look, I'm here with you right now.

247
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,845
We're on a date

248
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:28,047
and I thought we were
getting to know each other.

249
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,649
It doesn't just accumulate.

250
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:32,952
It takes intense,
prolonged contact.

251
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,789
Don't you want to be
close with anyone?

252
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:39,626
I do.

253
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:43,663
I know we're from
different generations

254
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,599
but I'm going to
need more from you.

255
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,035
We are from different generations,

256
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,970
because I don't remember
women pushing this hard.

257
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,973
And I'm not seeing anyone.

258
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,908
I'm working...

259
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:58,311
All the time.

260
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,712
Well, I get excited when you call

261
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,015
and then I don't hear from you.

262
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,759
We don't have to get married for me

263
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,485
to show you off at
the country club.

264
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:08,254
Don.

265
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:09,922
How are you?

266
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,259
I'm fine, Henry.

267
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,429
Henry, Betty,
this is miss van Nuys.

268
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:19,499
- Bethany.
- Enjoy your dinner.

269
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,075
My goodness, what was that?

270
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:32,145
Well, that was actually my ex-wife

271
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:35,148
and her husband

272
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:37,550
and some slob who's about to have
the worst dinner of his life.

273
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,552
What? Her?

274
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,435
Well, first of all, my official
capacity if anyone asks...

275
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:56,803
I'm here to thank you for securing

276
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,172
the governor's endorsement
for Congressman Lindsay.

277
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,674
That's no small feat, I'm sure.

278
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:04,043
Well, rocky only hates him
because he's handsome.

279
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,846
Well, not to worry.

280
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:08,348
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.

281
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,683
Any talk of the white
house is fiction.

282
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,386
Huh. I guess he hasn't
seen the cover of "life."

283
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:16,556
Okay.

284
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:19,759
Hypothetically,

285
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:22,328
the Congressman is putting
together a team with his eye on '72

286
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:27,033
and well, it would be built...

287
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,969
If it were going to be built...
around you.

288
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,308
And yes, he doesn't want
rocky to have you either.

289
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,781
Elizabeth, do you
know what you want?

290
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,883
Honey, this part is almost over.

291
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,985
I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

292
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:53,559
One drink and she gets flushed.

293
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:56,362
Yeah, my wife has
the other problem.

294
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,739
Are you okay in there,
ma'am? - Yes, I'm fine.

295
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,880
- You dropped your purse.
- I'll take it.

296
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,804
What did you want me to do,
put you in a cab?

297
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,972
That wouldn't be right.

298
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,041
I can't believe you made me
sit there and look at them.

299
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,976
Nobody said you had
to look at them.

300
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:47,246
You need a drink? Well,
what are you, a wino?

301
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:50,450
You need a drink? That is not
something you're allowed to say.

302
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,819
Oh, now you decide what
I can and can't say?

303
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:55,288
I was in a marriage
like that before.

304
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,924
You're gonna run into him.
It's a small town.

305
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:01,327
- I hate him.
- Hate's a strong word, Betty.

306
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,296
I hate Nazis.

307
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:05,231
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.

308
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,500
I don't like seeing her.
I don't hate her.

309
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:09,602
- You're a Saint.
- I'm an adult.

310
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,638
It was upsetting.
Can't you let me have that?

311
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:15,074
Not when it ruins
the whole evening.

312
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:17,877
This man is asking me to
take Lindsay all the way.

313
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:21,214
That could happen.
Don draper doesn't have a say.

314
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:25,651
- You're right. Who cares about him?
- You do.

315
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,587
He's taking up too much
space in your life,

316
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,889
maybe in your heart.

317
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:32,358
That's ridiculous.

318
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,027
Look,

319
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,797
maybe we rushed into this.

320
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,198
"We"?

321
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,667
I was six months
pregnant when we met.

322
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,872
- Pull over.
- Are you kidding me?

323
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:48,007
Let me out, Henry.

324
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:50,142
No, you know what?
Let me out at the house,

325
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,545
because you don't want
to live there anyway.

326
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:56,849
You can stay at a hotel or
wherever you were when I met you...

327
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,986
In your mansion with your servants.

328
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:01,954
Shut up, Betty. You're drunk.

329
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:27,713
What are you doing?

330
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,749
Making you comfortable.

331
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:46,465
She's a sweet girl

332
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:49,068
and she wants me to know her,

333
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:50,970
but I already do.

334
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,775
People tell you who they are,
but we ignore it

335
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,978
because we want them to
be who we want them to be.

336
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:07,787
To be continued.

337
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,294
I bet she was thinking
of that line all night.

338
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,600
I looked up at the Barbizon

339
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,401
and I thought of all
the women in there...

340
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:24,837
One in every room...

341
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,340
Touching themselves to sleep.

342
00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:32,712
Waverly and 6th.

343
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:37,783
I like sleeping alone,

344
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:40,086
stretching out like a skydiver,

345
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:43,255
cool patches to roll onto.

346
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:46,025
I just appreciate it more.

347
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:53,911
No. No! I'm talking now!

348
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:58,140
I don't care where you go and
I don't care what you do!

349
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,776
So in order...

350
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:03,779
Would you let me talk?
I want my key back,

351
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:06,849
I don't want to see
your shorts on my floor

352
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,117
and I don't want you
complaining......

353
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:09,618
...That I don't cook
'cause I don't cook!

354
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,523
You know what, David?
Go sitting in the ocean!

355
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:15,824
Good morning.

356
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:22,765
Are you leaving already?

357
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:29,772
Were you going to say goodbye?

358
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,174
I thought you could use the sleep.

359
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:36,512
I'm sorry, Henry.

360
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:40,649
Come over here.

361
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:55,697
I don't want to have to
defend myself all the time.

362
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,866
All the time?

363
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,335
Henry, I'm really sorry.

364
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,672
I know.

365
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,741
Get some sleep.

366
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,979
Carla took the kids to school.

367
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:15,584
Henry, he was the only
man I'd ever been with.

368
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,489
I'll call you later.

369
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:12,157
It tastes good, because it still

370
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,109
basically tastes like mountain dew.

371
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:17,279
And it's very simple to make.
I call it jet fuel.

372
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:20,482
Rocket fuel, and I like the
simplicity of the idea...

373
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,685
- Young people, hillbillies.
- Xerox crapped out again.

374
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:25,254
I think I killed it.

375
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,092
I'll run this specimen
over to the lab.

376
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,560
It's delicious.

377
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:37,166
Ah. You're a haircut,
you know that?

378
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,901
You need three ingredients
for a cocktail.

379
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:41,236
Vodka and mountain
dew is an emergency.

380
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,511
Don wants our freelance
art director Joey baird

381
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,246
put on full time for
the next three weeks.

382
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,115
None of my business I suppose.

383
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,791
I really think this vending
machine is a troublemaker.

384
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,227
I think it's been a great success.

385
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:07,229
Revenue is climbing.

386
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:11,033
I was gonna suggest we
get a sandwich machine.

387
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,601
We'd probably get 40% of the work

388
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:14,102
force keeping busy through lunch.

389
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,538
Or we'd end up with a
bunch of fat secretaries

390
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,273
who think the whole
afternoon is lunchtime,

391
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,642
because there's always another
sandwich around the corner.

392
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,178
There have been a
lot of complaints.

393
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:26,215
Did you tell them
to call the number?

394
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:31,553
What do you think they're doing
in there... Lane and Joan?

395
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:34,590
It's an unholy alliance.

396
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:36,325
I know exactly what
they're doing in there.

397
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:41,396
Joan's on the desk,
boobs on the blotter.

398
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:44,433
Lane's behind her,
probably has a bowler hat.

399
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,667
Am I wrong?

400
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,603
Hey, don't do that.

401
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,538
I'm not doing anything.
Joan's doing it.

402
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,077
Mountain Dew-dah.

403
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:58,313
Give me three cocktails with at
least three ingredients each.

404
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,249
Peggy Olson,

405
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,252
pioneering the science
of wet blanketry.

406
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,120
You love her.

407
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,927
Holy Francis calling.

408
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,075
- This is Don.
- Hello, Don. Henry Francis.

409
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,477
Sorry to bother you at work.

410
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:30,512
I assume it's important.

411
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,447
It is but not dire.

412
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,053
Okay. What can I do for you?

413
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,856
I bought a boat and I...

414
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,324
Well, I'd like to
put it in the garage

415
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,226
and I don't have the clearance
with your things there.

416
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:46,928
No, of course.

417
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:49,331
I can probably have
some movers take them,

418
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,933
put them in storage somewhere.
I can take it off the rent.

419
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:54,069
No. No, that's okay.

420
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:55,704
I should probably come
and get them myself.

421
00:27:57,907 --> 00:28:00,008
Gene's birthday
party's on Sunday...

422
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,544
I know.

423
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:05,013
...So I think Saturday
would be best, don't you?

424
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:10,385
I see.

425
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,287
The boat's coming next week so...

426
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:14,056
Fine.

427
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,590
I'll come at noon.

428
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,969
Miss blankenship,
can I get some coffee?

429
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,188
I just lost 30 in the machine.

430
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,984
How is that possible?

431
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,952
Well, I wanted a
pack of life savers

432
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,754
so I put in a nickel
and it didn't work.

433
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,923
So I looked in my purse and
all I had was a quarter,

434
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,124
so then I lost a quarter too.

435
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:47,293
Was the exact-change light on?

436
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,395
I started with the exact change.

437
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,898
Oh, Peggy, it's a nickel.

438
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,734
I'm not calling that number.
No one ever answers.

439
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:56,335
I can't believe you.

440
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,071
Fine, then give me
some life savers.

441
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:16,322
- Who did that?
- Did what?

442
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,825
That pornographic drawing.

443
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:22,428
It's a very brave person

444
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,163
that does something anonymously.

445
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,965
It's a very brave
person who does that.

446
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,167
It's still illegal in
many States you know.

447
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:38,945
I can't wait until next year
when all of you are in Vietnam.

448
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:41,047
You will be pining for the day

449
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,082
when someone was trying
to make your life easier.

450
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,785
And when you're over there,

451
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,387
you're in the jungle and
they're shooting at you,

452
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:52,158
remember you're not dying for me,
because I never liked you.

453
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,634
- Joan.
- Don't worry. I'm not going home.

454
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,371
Jesus. Scorched earth.

455
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:07,607
- What's wrong with her?
- I told you not to do that.

456
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,609
- Come on, Peggy.
- It's a joke.

457
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:15,748
She's still patting around
for the buzzer. I'm sorry.

458
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:18,117
What do you want?

459
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,923
Joey taped it to Joan's window.

460
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,393
- Really?
- Yes, and it's disrespectful to Joan

461
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:29,362
and it's disrespectful to me.

462
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,864
Narrative, forced perspective...
are you sure Joey did this?

463
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,634
Yes, I told him not to.

464
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,836
Well, I wouldn't tolerate
that if I were you.

465
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,704
But you have no problem with it?

466
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:41,207
I didn't say that.

467
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,142
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.

468
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,478
Me?

469
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,947
I thought you would go out
there and yell at him.

470
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,049
Yell at him, fire him.
Look, believe me...

471
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,584
You do not want me
involved in this.

472
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:53,519
People will think
you're a tattletale.

473
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:55,955
Dr. Miller has arrived.

474
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,258
Send her in.

475
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,461
You want some respect?
Go out there and get it for yourself.

476
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,566
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

477
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,705
Is everything all right?

478
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:14,040
Yes.

479
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,346
Joey, can I speak
to you for a minute?

480
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:21,747
- You want one?
- No.

481
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm sorry, okay?

482
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:37,430
Good. Now go apologize.

483
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,031
What? Then she'll know I did it.

484
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,267
You did do it. I told you not to.

485
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,902
Come on. It's funny.

486
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,870
Really? Would you show it to Lane?

487
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:46,205
He would think it's funny.

488
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,240
What if it were Don on his knees?

489
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:51,811
You have no sense of humor.

490
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,780
You're fired.

491
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:58,417
All right, all right.
I see the nostrils are flared.

492
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:01,120
- I'll go apologize.
- No, get your things.

493
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,022
- Are you serious?
- I am.

494
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:06,425
We'll see what Don has
to say about that.

495
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,361
Don doesn't even know who you are.

496
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,398
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

497
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:15,334
Hang on. Come on. This is crazy.

498
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,269
It's just a job, Joey.
You'll get another one.

499
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:26,345
Well, I was wrong about you.

500
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,194
What's going on?

501
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,363
Watch out, fellas. The fun's over.

502
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,333
- What?
- That's all, folks.

503
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,835
- Are you serious?
- A little bug bit me.

504
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:51,871
Well, I'll give you a call.
We'll have a drink.

505
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,977
Stan, throw vick chemical
on the back burner.

506
00:32:58,045 --> 00:32:59,845
You're on mountain dew.

507
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,919
You know, these guys
may be embarrassed

508
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,388
by having some professional
tell them what to do.

509
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,490
He'll take advice from another man.

510
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,627
Not if he knows more.

511
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:17,363
You know I'm right about auto parts.
I used to sell cars.

512
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:20,132
Yes, but we still have to do it.

513
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,836
God, this is boring.

514
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:27,907
I think I'm hungry.
Do you want to eat?

515
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:30,509
- You mean order in?
- I don't know.

516
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:31,977
You seem kind of dressed up.

517
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,214
We could take Fillmore
parts with us if you want.

518
00:33:39,252 --> 00:33:41,887
You'd like to have dinner with me?

519
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:46,992
Yes.

520
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:51,530
You asked me out the first
time I came in here.

521
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,866
Why would it be
different for me now?

522
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:58,137
It just felt like
the timing is right.

523
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:03,309
So why don't we do that?

524
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,344
You could ask me out for dinner

525
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,880
at some future date instead of...
I don't know...

526
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:10,249
Tacking it onto a workday
like an afterthought....

527
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,986
I could do that.

528
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:17,389
Saturday night far
enough in the future?

529
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,093
Not normally, but you're in luck.

530
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:24,096
Good.

531
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,598
Okay then.

532
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,868
I've got enough to go on here.

533
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:30,569
Okay.

534
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:32,204
- Good night.
- Good night.

535
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:41,922
It's Francine.

536
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,223
Come in.

537
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,928
Whoa. I'm all bitten up.

538
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,813
This is my potato salad bowl,
but this one's yours.

539
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,149
Well, thank you.

540
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,017
Henry was going to pick one
up on his way home from work,

541
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,686
but he's been so busy.

542
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,355
Oh, Betty, he's very ambitious.

543
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,957
He's mad at me.

544
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:03,826
Why would that be so?

545
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:08,397
Oh God, if I can make it
through this weekend...

546
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,399
It's awo-year-old's birthday party,

547
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:13,703
you'll have help and no one cares.

548
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,605
Oh.

549
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:19,475
Is he coming?

550
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,746
I told him about it.

551
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:25,781
Now I can only hope he
won't show up and ruin it.

552
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:27,616
Well, he won't.

553
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,552
We ran into him in the city...

554
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,654
On a date.

555
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:34,657
Bethany van Nuys...
she was all of 15.

556
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,928
I misbehaved.

557
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:42,198
Henry didn't understand
it for some reason.

558
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,400
Why do you let him bother you?

559
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:47,169
We see him walking out with
the kids some weekends.

560
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:50,606
- Carlton calls him "that sad bastard."
- That's an act.

561
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:53,075
He's living the life,
let me tell you.

562
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,378
He doesn't get to have
this family and that.

563
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,714
Oh, Betty.

564
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,083
You have terrible luck
with entertaining.

565
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,860
Just be careful.

566
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,895
Don has nothing to lose,

567
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,897
and you have everything.

568
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,184
I don't know if you heard,
but I fired Joey.

569
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:38,454
I did. Good for you.

570
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:42,391
Excuse me?

571
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,593
Now everybody in the
office will know

572
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,247
that you solved my
problem and that you

573
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:47,630
must be really important, I guess.

574
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:52,835
What's wrong with you?
I defended you.

575
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:54,870
You defended yourself.

576
00:36:54,938 --> 00:36:56,372
Fine.

577
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,042
That cartoon was disgusting.

578
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,644
I had already handled it

579
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,445
and if I had wanted to go further,

580
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,182
one dinner with Mr.
Kreutzer from Sugarberry ham

581
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,684
and Joey would've been off
it and out of my hair.

582
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:10,953
So? It's the same result.

583
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:14,123
You want to be a big shot.

584
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,493
Well, no matter how
powerful we get around here,

585
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,962
they can still just draw a cartoon.

586
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,954
So all you've done
is proved to them

587
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:23,666
that I'm a meaningless secretary

588
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,174
have a nice weekend.
Good night, Peggy.

589
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:43,018
When a man walks into a room,

590
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,187
he brings his whole life with him.

591
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:58,133
He has a million reasons
for being anywhere.

592
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,802
Just ask him.

593
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:07,042
If you listen, he'll tell
you how he got there,

594
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,149
how he forgot where he was going

595
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,352
and then he woke up.

596
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,490
If you listen, he'll tell you

597
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:23,425
about the time he
thought he was an angel

598
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,829
or dreamt of being perfect.

599
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,635
And then he'll smile with wisdom,

600
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,370
content that he'd realized

601
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,472
the world isn't perfect.

602
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:43,412
We're flawed because
we want so much more.

603
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,964
We're ruined

604
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:03,699
because we get these things

605
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,834
and wish for what we had.

606
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:21,684
- You smell nice.
- So do you,

607
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:24,553
like chlorine.

608
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:27,056
I've been swimming.

609
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:28,791
Does it feel like summer?

610
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:31,226
It clears my head.

611
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:34,530
- For the creative process?
- For something.

612
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:38,367
I've been a little
out of sorts lately.

613
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:43,072
It's an effort to get in the water,

614
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,474
but when you do you're weightless
and you don't even sweat.

615
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,544
And in the end,

616
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,579
you're wrung out.

617
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:57,219
I've been looking forward to this.

618
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:59,488
It's very hard to get
a reservation here.

619
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:04,026
You should've called me.
I know a guy.

620
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:06,028
Really?

621
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:08,030
Who's your guy?

622
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,798
My father.

623
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:14,670
A lot of people who
supply restaurants

624
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:16,739
know a lot of the same
people who know my father.

625
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:20,642
Like...?

626
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:24,513
Not my father, just his friends.

627
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:26,315
He owns a candy store

628
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:30,652
and there are certain
responsibilities

629
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,755
that go along with that.

630
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:34,923
Interesting.

631
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:37,793
What's he like?

632
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:42,731
He's a handsome two-bit
gangster like you.

633
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:47,102
Two glasses of chianti.

634
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:55,944
When I'm out of sorts,
I look at the calendar.

635
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:59,548
There's usually something
significant on the horizon.

636
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,752
I never noticed that.

637
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,691
It's my two-year-old's birthday,

638
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,761
but I'm not going.

639
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,265
Why not?

640
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,069
Because I'm not welcome there.

641
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,640
He thinks that man's his father.

642
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:29,244
Maybe that's okay.

643
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:31,980
All he knows of the world

644
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:33,482
is what you show him.

645
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:50,799
Oh, that's nice.

646
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,611
I know I've sometimes
behaved to the contrary,

647
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,580
but I do admire your work.

648
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,915
That's nice to hear.

649
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,252
So tell me a trade secret.

650
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,989
How do you get them to do
what you want them to do?

651
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:20,329
Aesop has a fable about
the wind and the sun.

652
00:42:21,764 --> 00:42:24,633
The wind and the sun
had this competition

653
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:26,668
to see if they could get
a traveler's coat off.

654
00:42:26,736 --> 00:42:29,938
So the wind blows fiercely on him,

655
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,542
but the traveler just
pulls his coat tighter.

656
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,211
But the sun shines down on him,

657
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:38,013
warmer and warmer,

658
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:40,616
and the traveler just

659
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,217
takes it off.

660
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:45,220
And the moral is?

661
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:50,225
Kindness, gentleness
and persuasion win

662
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,194
where force fails.

663
00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:57,299
You know, Aesop did that
in probably 10 lines.

664
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,202
He's very economical.

665
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,504
So what you're saying
is you want my coat.

666
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,225
72nd and Broadway.

667
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:24,927
Thank you.

668
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,658
Where do you live?

669
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:58,760
Only around the corner.

670
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:00,629
Really?

671
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:04,132
Yes.

672
00:44:05,668 --> 00:44:07,569
But I'm just going to
take you to your door.

673
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:12,507
And why is that?

674
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:18,180
Because that's as far
as I can go right now

675
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:20,949
and I'm not ready
to say good night.

676
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,054
That's not what I expected.

677
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:43,231
- Hello, Francine.
- Hello, Don.

678
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:44,299
Daddy!

679
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:50,172
What's he doing here?

680
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:52,574
It's okay.

681
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:05,220
Here you go. Say hi to daddy.

682
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:06,888
Happy Birthday.

683
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:14,629
We have everything.

684
