1
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,925
Who is Don Draper?

2
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,303
Excuse me?

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,102
Who is Don Draper?

4
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,441
What do men say when you ask that?

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,606
Well, they usually take a minute
to think about it,

6
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,441
and then they do something cute.

7
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,277
One creative director said
he was a lion tamer.

8
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,496
I don't want to do that.

9
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,790
In the third person?

10
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,535
I don't know.

11
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,746
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

12
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,424
Take the train, maybe take your car
now that you can afford it.

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,585
And who told you that?

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,255
Anything? I mean, now's your chance.

15
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,557
Well, as I said before, I'm from the Midwest.

16
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,265
We were taught that it's not polite
to talk about yourself.

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,905
Obviously your Glo-Coat floor wax
commercials caused a bit of a squeal.

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,732
On the creative side, anyway.

19
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,567
What made you think of this idea?

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,030
I wanted it to be indistinguishable
from the movies.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,957
I wanted people to be watching it and say,

22
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,205
"What's happening in the story right now?
It's something else."

23
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,003
It's not an ad.

24
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,421
At least not for the first 30 seconds of it.

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,424
Very good, then. I think I have all I need.

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,967
It's only a few hundred words,

27
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,600
but on the bright side,
the picture may be bigger than the article.

28
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,441
You all should meet. This is Jack Hammond
from Advertising Age.

29
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,859
Roger Sterling and Pete Campbell.

30
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,189
I hope we're not interrupting this crisp
and engaging portrait you're painting.

31
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,445
Steady there.

32
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,373
-What happened there?
-Korea.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,743
We're grateful for your sacrifice. Peter.

34
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,046
Jack. Well, it's nice to meet you all.

35
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,754
Yeah, I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

36
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,673
Certainly.

37
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,220
Don, it was a pleasure.

38
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,343
-I look forward to the article.
-We all do.

39
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,397
My uncle lost his leg hitching a trailer.

40
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,273
He used to ask me to scratch his toes.
He didn't have any.

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,356
-We don't have time, Roger.
-One quick pop, Louise.

42
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,908
All right. Where is this party?
The Sheraton?

43
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,286
A wooden leg.

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,410
They're so cheap
they can't even afford a whole reporter.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,129
I'm Peter Campbell,
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

46
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,002
-Yeah.
-And this must be Murray.

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,754
Bob. Murray stayed in Portland.

48
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,428
Too bad. Missing jackhammer season.
Roger Sterling.

49
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,637
-And you must be Donald Draper.
-Don.

50
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,259
Bob.

51
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,188
We're very, very excited
you had time to meet with us, Don.

52
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,481
Murray told us Y&R had done Glo-Coat.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,938
Turns out everybody in New York,
except him, knows it's you.

54
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,319
And I think they're a little jealous.

55
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,614
Can't tell who the client is here.

56
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:01,079
I know a little, but what we need to know,
what Don needs to know is,

57
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,209
what exactly is your concern?

58
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,708
Well, I must say I'm getting tired of
saying this today.

59
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,589
Next time, just have one meeting.

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,046
We at Jantzen have had
a steady 25% bite of the apple.

61
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,130
But the two-piece is most of our concern.

62
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,382
You have a great bikini.

63
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:21,221
I've spent some time with the catalog,
and I would say no concerns at all.

64
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,480
It's not a bikini.

65
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,733
Bikini is underwear you wear to the beach.

66
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,735
We make a two-piece bathing suit.

67
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,314
We're a family company.

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,823
And nowadays it's tough to make a dent
if your ads don't look like a girlie magazine.

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,039
Do you want women who want bikinis
to buy your two-piece,

70
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,206
or do you just want to make sure

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,081
women who want a two-piece
don't suddenly buy a bikini?

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,334
My Lord.
That question just tied a knot in my brain.

73
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,094
Our competitors get bigger
the smaller they make that swimsuit.

74
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,934
We don't do that.

75
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,104
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

76
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,726
And that's just who our customers are.

77
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,524
Right now.

78
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,605
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

79
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,907
You know one of them is leaving New York
with VD.

80
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,612
-Where the hell have you been?
-What's the problem?

81
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,696
-Don!
-Can you give me a minute?

82
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,244
I don't mind waiting.

83
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,584
How'd it go?

84
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,295
Get back to work.

85
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,766
How was your interview?

86
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,310
Count to 100 and buzz me.

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,993
You missed Jeff Atherton.

88
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,030
He came here expressly to see you.

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,284
I'm sorry, I didn't know he was coming,
and I don't know who that is.

90
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,995
You have no idea
how tiny this place looks to a stranger.

91
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,671
Did you tell him about the second floor?

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,084
I refuse to be any part of that charade.

93
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,050
I wanted an office downtown. We overspent.

94
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,972
We could have got a lot more for our money.

95
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,674
And we could have had a conference table.

96
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,557
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table was deliberate.

97
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,392
He felt that a circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

98
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,940
About why there is no table.

99
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,660
They loved you.
What exactly is the problem?

100
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,033
Well, first of all, they're prudes.

101
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,865
Second of all, Y&R was standing
in the hallway when we left.

102
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,044
-You've been on a cattle call before.
-When the competition was fair.

103
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,044
Every hour of my time has to be accounted
for in the growth of this company.

104
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,626
Get me in a room where I have a chance.

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,719
In the end, it's going to come down to
big versus small.

106
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,142
There's two firms in the middle,
Kenyon & Eckhardt and D'Arcy.

107
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,389
They'll cancel each other out.

108
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,055
Y&R has six floors of creative.

109
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,391
They can throw bodies at this account
for weeks.

110
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,817
We don't have that kind of firepower.

111
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,313
We don't have to. We're the scrappy upstart.

112
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,737
You don't say that to the clients, do you?

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,989
-Your accountant is waiting.
-Send him in.

114
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,582
Creatively, Y&R is not capable of living
in this neighborhood.

115
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,159
You know why?

116
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,710
Because you don't work there.

117
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,718
John.

118
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,546
Marsha.

119
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,506
John.

120
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,175
Marsha.

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,347
John.

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,018
Happy Thanksgiving.

123
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,274
My mother's gonna be over the moon.

124
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,852
Enjoy it. it's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

125
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,608
-What?
-Did you kill Sugarberry?

126
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,860
That's a third of my work.

127
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,733
Stop jumping to conclusions.

128
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,194
I guess when Kreutzer said
they were going to send us all hams,

129
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,325
he really meant one in a cardboard box
with no note.

130
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,499
It's about as subtle as an atomic bomb.

131
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,825
Maybe they're cheap.

132
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,872
Do you honestly think this is a good sign?

133
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,707
-The work was old-fashioned.
-And whose fault is that?

134
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,468
Well, testing at four supermarkets
in Queens.

135
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,545
How much were they spending? Nothing.

136
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,090
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national,

137
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,470
and it could be a big account.

138
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,893
Damn it!

139
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,266
I thought we were getting on a streak.

140
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,399
Does this mean
I'm down to two days a week?

141
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,234
Don hated the work.

142
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,485
Put the ham on his desk.

143
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,529
He's probably having Thanksgiving dinner
alone in there.

144
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,656
That's not nice.

145
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,571
Marsha!

146
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,528
I'm serious.

147
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,082
I have a life insurance policy.
It's a company policy.

148
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,502
It pays the company, not the family.

149
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,124
What do you think?

150
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,833
It wouldn't be bad
to have a little security for the kids.

151
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,005
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

152
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,961
Uncle Sam will take a healthy bite.

153
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,592
He already has.

154
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,468
And the only other issue is the house.

155
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
What about it?

156
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,098
Well, October 1st,
she was supposed to be out.

157
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,518
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

158
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,197
Get her and him out of there and sell it.

159
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,196
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

160
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,990
Start World War III?

161
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:35,659
You're carrying a mortgage, plus insurance,
and taxes for a house you don't live in.

162
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,454
Leave it alone.

163
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,043
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

164
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,295
Come on.

165
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,014
"I don't want it like this. I want it like that.

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,092
"Not too much of that, just a little like this."

167
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,428
And then they look at it,
and they don't like it.

168
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,642
Two of their test markets
are in Jewish neighborhoods.

169
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,268
They're idiots.

170
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,894
How much does it cost
for us to buy all the product?

171
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,938
Too much, and we'd have to do it every day.

172
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,110
So how much does it cost for us to get

173
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,743
100 women to line up at one store
one afternoon,

174
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,948
clean them out once?

175
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,376
One hundred people?
Do you know how big a line that is?

176
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,873
People would talk about it.

177
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,751
-It's a PR stunt.
-We don't do that.

178
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,708
-Why not?
-Because you can't charge for it.

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,172
So what?

180
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:33,137
Two women fighting over one ham,
but they have to really fight.

181
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,264
They have to get arrested or something.

182
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,845
Because it's the last ham.

183
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,184
We don't have to write a play.

184
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,063
It's Thanksgiving.
They're shopping, the stakes are very high.

185
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,025
Old Chuck Dewey could probably get a story
in the Daily News for a case of something.

186
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,200
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys what's-her-name.

187
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,152
Who's the old lady
who never takes off her mittens?

188
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,779
I don't have any money.

189
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,035
-John!
-Marsha!

190
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,284
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

191
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,337
Top-shelf liquor, what's that gonna run?

192
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,632
Harry gets a case a month for sticking
his nose up some guy's ass at NBC.

193
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,172
Should I run it by Don?

194
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,635
Really?

195
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,466
We'll see. I'll call casting.

196
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,774
Good. I got you when you're vulnerable.

197
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,729
What do you need?

198
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,947
Someone white to carve our turkey.

199
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,321
I can't, Roger. I have plans.

200
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,986
You told me that.

201
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,537
Then you told me you had the kids
the day after.

202
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,036
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

203
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,412
No.

204
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,165
I was thinking the other day
about what happens when you leave here,

205
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,666
and it made me very upset.

206
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,790
I could say the same thing.

207
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,755
I'll paint you the picture that's in my mind,

208
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,336
but if it's true, I might kill myself.

209
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,505
I've hardly been a monk.

210
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,426
Forget that she knows Jane.
This girl's terrific.

211
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,763
She looks like Virginia Mayo, she's 25,
Mount Holyoke gymnastics team.

212
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,644
See her this weekend.

213
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,435
You hit it off, come Turkey Day,
maybe you can stuff her.

214
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,945
Sweetheart, 8:00 Saturday night,
Jimmy's La Grange.

215
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,029
For beauty and the beast.

216
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,113
Roger.

217
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,955
They have chicken Kiev.
The butter squirts everywhere.

218
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,218
Hello, Mr. Draper.

219
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,015
Hello, Celia.

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,184
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold, too.

221
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,565
I look forward to it.

222
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,980
But you don't eat nothing.

223
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,279
Have you seen my shine kit?

224
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,069
I put it on the top of the closet.

225
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,654
The children coming this weekend?

226
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,829
No. You need to put things back
where you found them.

227
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,167
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

228
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,928
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

229
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,309
And eat something.

230
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,549
Let me out of here!

231
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,802
Let me out of here!

232
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,431
Let me out of here!

233
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,563
Footprints on a wet floor
That's no longer a hanging offense.

234
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,902
Glo-Coat's patented formula
goes on easy and dries in seconds.

235
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,634
So how do you know Jane?

236
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,219
Before you ask me all the questions,
you have to let me finish one glass.

237
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,305
I don't have to ask you any questions.

238
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,903
I think I'm actually nervous.
I haven't done this since college.

239
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,107
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

240
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,941
I borrowed a dress.

241
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,778
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

242
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,325
Do you want to see it?

243
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,797
I can't believe I did that.

244
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,801
It's hard to believe there are two girls
who can wear that.

245
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,559
Don, I want to lift a shadow off this evening.

246
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,020
I Know this is your first date.

247
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,067
First that Roger was involved in.

248
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,774
Of course. I'm sure. It's just...

249
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,034
I'm breaking a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

250
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,581
But Jane has made you her personal cause.

251
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,749
And there are so many real problems
in the world.

252
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,795
I know. The world is so dark right now.

253
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,213
The country?

254
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,016
My goodness, you've made me
feel very serious all of a sudden.

255
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,310
I don't know if I can make you feel better
about the world.

256
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:56,100
One of the boys killed in Mississippi,
Andrew Goodman, he was from here.

257
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,978
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

258
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,031
Is that what it takes to change things?

259
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,785
What do you do?

260
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,405
I'm an actress.

261
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,490
But right now I'm a super in the opera.

262
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,033
And what is that?

263
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,202
A supernumerary.

264
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,629
We're the actors that fill the stage.

265
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,756
Like the chorus?

266
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,967
No singing.

267
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,387
I do a lot of mock drinking. I'm a wench.

268
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,512
I'm a courtesan. Part of a harem.

269
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,510
It depends on the opera.

270
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,435
That is truly fascinating.

271
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,486
I love the music, and I love backstage.

272
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,739
Our costumes are as good as the singers'.

273
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,192
And I love the stories.

274
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,202
They're very romantic.

275
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,363
Have you been?

276
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,915
I have.

277
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,961
But only for business,
so I've never enjoyed it.

278
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,835
Well, then you must come as my guest.

279
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,799
They give the supers tickets
instead of paying a decent wage.

280
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,296
Madam?

281
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,216
I don't even need to look. Chicken Kiev.

282
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,891
They make you wear a bib.

283
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,807
Come on. Let's have some fun.

284
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,981
Two chicken Kievs.

285
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,908
The Barbizon.

286
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,452
I bet that would make a great opera.

287
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,829
It would.

288
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,324
Well, I guess this is "good night."

289
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,000
Okay.

290
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,172
Good night.

291
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,678
So am I gonna see you
at Roger and Jane's for Thanksgiving?

292
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,467
It's tempting, but I have plans.

293
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,267
I'm sure the holidays must be very complex.

294
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,951
It may have been a while since you've had to
pick up on messages,

295
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,661
but I want to see you again.

296
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,963
How about right now?

297
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,963
I stopped the meter. We can start it again.
It'll be like I just picked you up.

298
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,553
Will you please take a week no?

299
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,132
Let's see where we are New Year's Eve.

300
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,431
-If it's meant to be, it'll keep.
-Let me walk you in.

301
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,680
No. I know that trick.

302
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,547
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

303
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,429
I think you both
really acquitted yourselves well.

304
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,555
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

305
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,136
My objective was to get the ham.

306
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,098
No one told you to hit me.
That wasn't part of it.

307
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,647
The important thing is that...
Here's Mr. Campbell.

308
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,281
I've been assured
that you ladies can look for your names

309
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,609
and perhaps your picture
in Monday's Daily News.

310
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,867
What section?

311
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,287
It's the Daily News. it's one big section.

312
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,121
All in all, not a bad way to spend a Sunday.

313
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,876
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

314
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,880
We probably shouldn't have
any more contact for the time being.

315
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,049
Shall we?

316
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,387
We really appreciate your talent
and, of course, your discretion.

317
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,475
You hurt me.

318
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,148
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

319
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,559
Daisy!

320
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,859
Walk her to the train.

321
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,776
-Are you okay, dear?
-Yeah.

322
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,280
Let's get you in a cab.

323
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,661
Morning.

324
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,833
Welcome back. How was Los Angeles?

325
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,578
Very hard to leave.

326
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,501
I would love a vacation.

327
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,255
It wasn't a vacation.
I had a lot of tsuris with Lucy and Desi.

328
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,336
Has someone been using my office?

329
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,216
Mr. Sterling doesn't have a television.

330
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,183
I'm calling a meeting for 11:00.
No, make it 1:00.

331
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,387
-Do we have a table yet?
-1:30, and no.

332
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,557
-Hi.
-Yes?

333
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,766
Do you know where the Secor rough cut is?

334
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,101
I got it!

335
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,942
Don't you want to know why?

336
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,525
I sold the Jai Alai TV special.

337
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,777
Really?

338
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,827
ABC, they're moving towards all these
eccentric sporting events, go-karts.

339
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,033
Well, that's very exciting.

340
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,960
Can you get someone to track down
a cup of coffee for me?

341
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,378
And I'd love a grapefruit juice-

342
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,547
And, Joan, that is my news.

343
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,050
I won't even tell people after it's aired.

344
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,593
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

345
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,644
Don, can I speak with you for a minute?

346
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,189
Morning.

347
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,319
-Lane, would you excuse us for a minute?
-Of course.

348
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,196
Good morning, Don.

349
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:49,126
You know, no one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

350
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,374
has thought it's been portrayed honestly
in the newspaper.

351
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,637
"Donald Draper, or Don as he is known,
perhaps in an attempt to appear humble,

352
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,089
"is a handsome cipher.

353
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,596
"One imagines somewhere in an attic

354
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,804
"there's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

355
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,348
For a guy from Ad Age, he can really write.

356
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,980
-He also says you're married.
-Jesus.

357
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,107
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

358
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,611
You didn't give him any facts.
He had to make some assumptions.

359
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,945
My job is to write ads,
not go around talking about who I am.

360
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,201
Who knows who you are?

361
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,784
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

362
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,290
-Why do you have so many copies?
-I bought one to read.

363
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,999
I was going to buy one
to frame in reception, and then I read it.

364
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,175
I just wanted to get them all
before anyone else did.

365
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,378
It'll be lining bird cages by Friday.

366
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,963
This is a missed opportunity.

367
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,096
You turned all the sizzle from Glo-Coat
into a wet fart.

368
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,969
Plus, you sound like a prick.

369
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,187
Well, it's done.

370
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,440
I learned a valuable lesson.

371
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,983
Stay away from one-legged reporters.

372
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,984
Yeah, I was thinking about that.
Who is he to criticize anybody?

373
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,158
Just so you don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

374
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,113
Jane's friend found you to be charming.
Although a little grabby in the car.

375
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,368
That is good news. Thank you.

376
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,000
She liked you. Maybe you should have
fondled Peg-Leg Pete.

377
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,913
They raise you up and they knock you down.

378
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,417
I don't know
what I could have done differently.

379
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,842
I believe that you were being modest,
but he didn't.

380
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,888
I'm sorry, but after the year you've had,
it's just not appropriate anymore.

381
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,644
He's expecting us!

382
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,519
-Is Joey coming?
-I'm here.

383
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,688
Why can't you come to our office?

384
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,861
Do you want to hear
what Sugarberry said or not?

385
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,029
Shoot.

386
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,987
It was uproarious. First it's Darryl,

387
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,444
and he tells me about how they
stared at the article all day yesterday,

388
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,029
worrying about a lawsuit.

389
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,412
So I hang up and debate whether or not
to tell Don, throw myself on my sword.

390
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,460
And then Kreutzer calls to tell me
other papers picked up the story.

391
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,537
And I think, "He knows it's us,"
but how could he?

392
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,545
And he said everyone, especially Darryl,
was very excited.

393
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,344
And then he gets Christian.

394
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,387
He's sorry someone got hurt,

395
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,137
but more people will taste their ham now,
and they'll love it.

396
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,850
It's beautiful.

397
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,599
How do you put something like this
in your book?

398
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,180
You can't. We can't even charge them.

399
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,441
Well, it wouldn't be a bad idea for them
to increase their media budget.

400
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,944
-Seize the moment.
-With more crappy ads?

401
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,154
-Hopefully not.
-You use it.

402
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,983
"The winner of the ham battle is you."

403
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
Can you imagine?

404
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,405
Lane's dentures would drop out of his head
if we came in with an additional buy.

405
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,077
"Our hams are worth fighting for."

406
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:42,588
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

407
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,218
Old ladies will smile.

408
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,013
Why didn't you pitch that two months ago?
It's good on its own.

409
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,261
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

410
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,012
Black crayon. I need it in an hour.

411
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,721
Chop-chop, Joey.

412
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,351
Clara, could you get Darryl for me
at Sugarberry?

413
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,731
Tell him it's urgent.

414
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,608
I may need you.

415
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,653
Horace Cook, Jr. It's urgent.

416
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,949
Ho-Ho. How was Tijuana?

417
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,122
I have to say, it's a very flattering picture.

418
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,751
And I don't think I'd mind
being described that way.

419
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,204
Mr. Crane, you're a salesman.

420
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,631
You do not want to be known as mysterious.

421
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,674
There'll be no further discussion.

422
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,504
I just got off the phone with Ho-Ho.
Jai Alai is leaving.

423
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,798
-What?
-it's over.

424
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,559
Bullshit. I just sold a TV special to ABC.

425
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,062
Well, apparently Don didn't mention them
in the article.

426
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,399
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

427
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,236
Spectacular.

428
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,610
What the hell's Ho-Ho doing
reading Ad Age?

429
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,690
Fix it.

430
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,657
Todd got all the partners from CGC to call,
and they worked them up and down.

431
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,580
-They told him we laugh about him.
-I don't!

432
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,751
Get him on the phone, get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

433
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,043
He hung up on me.

434
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,373
I think he was crying.

435
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,839
How much was left in Ho-Ho anyway?

436
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,972
We'll survive with Jai Alai off our list.

437
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,766
We will survive, but for how long?

438
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:18,847
The loss of Jai Alai
makes Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

439
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,182
It's an untenably insecure position.

440
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,029
Harry, why don't you call
and pretend like you don't Know any of this.

441
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,523
Give it an hour so he'll take the call.

442
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,327
I wish we really had a second floor
so I could jump off it.

443
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,250
I'm going to have to get you
another interview.

444
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,752
The Wall Street Journal.

445
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,132
And what do I do differently?
I told him the truth.

446
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,888
Who gives a crap what I say anyway?
My work speaks for me.

447
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,886
Turning creative success into business
is your work.

448
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,512
And you've failed.

449
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,023
It'll pass.

450
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,785
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

451
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,663
Happy Thanksgiving.

452
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,661
We started without you.

453
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,748
Grandma Pauline, I told you Mother's
was at noon. We already ate.

454
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,925
Well, you're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

455
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,669
Thank you.

456
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,754
Jamie, you'll have something?

457
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,757
We missed dessert.

458
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,934
You're next to your father.

459
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,220
Put up some coffee, dear.

460
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,852
-Hi, Daddy.
-Isn't that sweet?

461
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,935
We didn't forget you.

462
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,071
What do you say?

463
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,490
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

464
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,067
After you eat.

465
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,788
The traffic was simply murder.

466
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,829
That's because
that's what's become of this country.

467
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,956
Everyone has two Thanksgivings to go to.

468
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,131
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

469
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,927
Don't you like the food, dear?

470
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,804
-No.
-Sally Draper, that's rude.

471
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,479
-You love cranberry sauce.
-It has seeds in it.

472
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,147
-How about the sweet potato?
-I'm not hungry.

473
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,309
Look, there's marshmallow.

474
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,651
Oh, Lord.

475
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,242
She might have a fever.

476
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,533
-I'm sorry.
-it's all right, dear.

477
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,873
Isabel, can you bring a rag?

478
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,329
Stop pinching me!

479
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,678
I love sweet potatoes.

480
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,847
Isabel.

481
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,731
Happy Thanksgiving.

482
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,731
Do you want a drink?

483
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,567
I don't have much time.
I have supper with my family.

484
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,945
Of course you do.

485
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,076
Should I not have mentioned my family?

486
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,577
I never know how you're going to react.

487
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,708
No, that's fine.

488
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,263
-Let me take off my brassiere.
-No. In a minute.

489
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,883
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

490
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,303
So do it.

491
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,224
Harder.

492
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,144
Again.

493
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,207
Hold on.

494
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,421
Surprise. It's for you.

495
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,013
Why did you answer it?

496
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,888
It was the third try. I couldn't take it.

497
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,015
-Hello?
-Happy Thanksgiving.

498
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,225
Happy Thanksgiving.

499
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,277
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

500
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,733
What's wrong?

501
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,658
I need $280 for bail.

502
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,993
Bye.

503
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,279
Where are you?

504
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,449
It's not for me.

505
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,371
Spit it out, honey.

506
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,749
You're going to laugh.

507
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:04,465
Pete and I hired some actresses
to get in a fight over a Sugarberry ham.

508
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,633
You know, as a stunt.

509
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,971
We got them to increase their media budget.

510
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,305
Hello?

511
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,145
I'm here.

512
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:18,278
Well, one of them pressed charges
against the other for assault.

513
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,153
It's $80 bail and $100 apiece
to keep their mouths shut.

514
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,326
And it has to happen today.

515
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,403
Call Pete!

516
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,702
Do you think you're my first call?

517
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,670
Hello. I'm so sorry to bother you.

518
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,920
-I ought to let you twist in the wind.
-It still worked out.

519
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,422
-You'll be very happy.
-I'm not happy.

520
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,051
And I don't think it's funny or cute.
You run something like that by me first.

521
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,386
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

522
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,560
or worse yet, making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

523
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,771
You want people
to think we're idiots, Peggy?

524
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,310
Hey, there's no reason for name-calling.
She's been agonizing.

525
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,439
Who are you?

526
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,862
I'm her fiancé.

527
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,902
Mark, don't.

528
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,110
Why'd you bring him up here
if you didn't want him involved?

529
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,700
I know. I'm sorry, Don.

530
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,286
-Fiancé?
-It just came out.

531
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,633
Did you put the dog out?

532
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,262
It's cold outside.
But I locked her in the laundry room.

533
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
It's not cold in here.

534
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,577
Sally.

535
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,039
I was calling Daddy.

536
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,082
Hello?

537
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,248
I wanted to wish him a happy Thanksgiving.

538
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,671
You'll see him tomorrow.

539
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,674
You want to call him to complain
about how awful I am?

540
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,506
Don't expect any sympathy
when he hears my side of the story.

541
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,550
-Don't!
-Go to bed.

542
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm going to have them
take that phone out of the hallway.

543
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,038
Tomorrow, when the kids go,

544
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,993
why don't we have Carla take the baby,
and we'll drive to a nice dinner?

545
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,581
Maybe Essex.

546
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,497
The Griswold Inn.

547
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,500
Okay.

548
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,132
I'm really full, Betty.

549
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,817
Daddy!

550
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,985
Dad.

551
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,026
-How much turkey did you eat?
-I ate everything.

552
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,034
-Hello, Daddy.
-Hello.

553
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,335
9:00 tomorrow night.

554
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,080
-Where's the baby?
-I had Carla take him.

555
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,382
You weren't going to.
Henry and I have plans.

556
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,549
I'd like to see him.

557
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,012
-Hello, Don.
-Henry.

558
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,512
Come on, let's go.

559
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,531
Garage door.

560
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,037
What are you doing?

561
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,039
You know what I'm doing.

562
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,387
The button fell off my pajamas.

563
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,974
-I'll sew it on in the morning.
-You know how to sew?

564
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,473
I can do a button. I'll show you.

565
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,062
I'll leave the light on in the bathroom
so there won't be any more problems, okay?

566
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,317
Okay.

567
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,819
Good night, Daddy.

568
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,911
Good night, both of you.

569
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,282
Do you have your key?

570
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,684
-Hello?
-Maybe they're asleep.

571
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,221
Go upstairs.

572
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,263
What the hell is the dog doing in the house?

573
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,391
You run up to bed. I'll wait.

574
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,972
For what?

575
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,765
It's almost 10:00.

576
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,602
-I thought you said 10:00.
-She didn't.

577
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,482
I've waited for you plenty of times.

578
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,273
Henry, do you mind?

579
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,367
-Betty?
-it's okay.

580
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,410
Does that mean I should stay or not stay?

581
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,783
Stay.

582
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,835
When are you moving out?

583
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,704
I don't know.

584
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,289
Well, you were supposed to be out
a month ago.

585
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,216
We haven't found the right place
for the kids.

586
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,428
Well, either do as we agreed,
or I'm gonna need to collect rent.

587
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,504
What?

588
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,923
Or you could just buy it from me
if you want to.

589
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,224
-I can't believe you.
-Don, it's temporary.

590
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,555
Believe me, Henry,
everybody thinks this is temporary.

591
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,975
Good night.

592
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,237
He has some nerve.

593
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,908
I know you don't want to hear this,
but he's right.

594
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,867
Haven't the kids been through
enough change already?

595
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,376
-I can't just uproot them with no place to go.
-You're not even looking.

596
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,790
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

597
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,429
Miss Olson is here to see you.

598
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,814
Send her in.

599
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,321
They sent one for each of us.

600
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,538
Could have just as easily fired us.

601
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,625
But they didn't,
because they sold more hams.

602
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,037
And now you get to tell them why
if you want.

603
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,292
I think they'll be impressed.

604
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,504
Well, I'm not.

605
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,092
I try and stay away
from these kinds of shenanigans.

606
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,094
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

607
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,343
It was going great until it wasn't.

608
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,312
Thanks for the ham.

609
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,145
I should have told you.

610
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,983
Since when do you have a fiance?

611
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,440
I don't.

612
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,117
But you didn't have to do that that way.

613
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,741
You brought him with you because
you thought I wouldn't embarrass you.

614
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,993
At least I'm thinking ahead.

615
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,834
Doesn't always work, does it?

616
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,423
You need to think a little bit more
about the image of this agency.

617
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,092
Well, nobody knows about the ham stunt,

618
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,512
so our image remains
pretty much where you left it.

619
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,341
I won't need you
in the Jantzen presentation.

620
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,013
Now you're being spiteful.

621
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,055
No, I just think it would be better
not to have a girl in the room.

622
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,563
You know something?
We are all here because of you.

623
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,825
All we want to do is please you.

624
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,167
Why don't I put them in the pantry?
Christmas is around the corner.

625
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,248
Put them in the basement.

626
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,051
Did the children like their gifts?

627
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,588
They did.

628
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,847
It's nice the holiday is memorable
in some other way.

629
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,518
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

630
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,269
Next time I'll tell her not to get sick.

631
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:02,066
I've raised children in my life, Henry.
They're terrified of her.

632
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,606
You don't know any of the people
you're talking about.

633
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,067
Well, I know what you see in her.

634
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,573
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

635
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,915
Why can't you give her a chance?
She loves you.

636
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,909
She's a silly woman.

637
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,457
Honestly, Henry. I don't know
how you can stand living in that man's dirt.

638
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,009
You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,

639
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,594
take off your robe,
you head into the Cabana.

640
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,227
There's no other way to slice it,
you're getting undressed.

641
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,728
Can I put my feet on this?

642
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,936
-Pretend like it's your living room.
-Thank you.

643
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,356
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

644
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,821
The cut and the print of the cloth
and some sort of gentlemen's agreement.

645
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,292
"So well built,
we can't show you the second floor."

646
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,845
I think that's a little suggestive.

647
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,015
Good. That's what I was going for.

648
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,971
A wink, but it's not a leer.

649
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,477
We don't want a wink.

650
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,935
I think I explained
our product is for modest people.

651
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,105
Modest people want to be stimulated, too.

652
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,072
This draws them in in a way

653
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,116
that will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

654
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,115
Plus, they'll be dying to see the suit.

655
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,288
They'll be dying to see the girl.

656
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,162
And for all we know,
she's not even wearing a top.

657
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,336
You'll get them into the store.
isn't that the point?

658
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,506
It's not wholesome. It's not...

659
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,172
Did I tell you we're a family company?

660
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,925
I think I know what you're looking for.

661
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,005
A couple of women bouncing a beach ball,

662
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,183
little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

663
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,930
Your competitors are gonna keep killing you
because you're too scared of the skin

664
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,857
that your two-piece
was designed to show off.

665
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:08,693
Well, it's somehow dirtier
not seeing anything.

666
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,487
You need to decide
what kind of company you want to be.

667
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,322
Comfortable and dead,
or risky and possibly rich.

668
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,869
All I know is we don't want that.

669
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,753
Well, gentlemen, you were wondering
what a creative agency looks like,

670
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,501
there you have it.

671
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,670
Hope you enjoyed looking in the window.

672
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,711
Give me a minute.

673
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,011
Where are you going?

674
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,101
Control yourself. Cool off.

675
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,314
And hopefully Campbell can talk them into
hearing a few more ideas in a week or so.

676
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,108
What? No. That's not the point.

677
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,278
Out. Get out.

678
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,776
-Don.
-Excuse me?

679
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,325
Get your things
and get out of my office now.

680
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,408
Come on. Let's go.

681
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,756
Call Bert Cooper's man at
The Wall Street Journal.

682
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,676
There's always a name in every partnership
that defines who they are.

683
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,014
In the case of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
would you say that's Donald Draper?

684
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,770
Yes.

685
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,818
Really?

686
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,609
Last year,
our agency was being swallowed whole.

687
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,359
I realized I had two choices.

688
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,116
I could die of boredom
or holster up my guns.

689
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,701
So I walked into Lane Pryce's office
and I said,

690
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:45,956
"Fire us."

691
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,509
Two days later,
we were operating out of the Pierre Hotel.

692
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,963
Within a year, we had taken over two floors
of the Time-Life Building.
