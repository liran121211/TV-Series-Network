Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.

3
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:05,809
Why? Because she couldn't hear.

4
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:08,513
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,344
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,809
Ken has accounts.

7
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,640

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,632
Abe. Are you with Joyce?

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:19,592
Are you?

10
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,857
It's basic training. I'll be back.

11
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:24,656
What am I gonna do?
Who I'm gonna talk to?

12

I'm just gonna take you to your door.

That was Friday.

17

Look, I'll clear lunch plus one hour

18
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,503
and we'll grab a sandwich
and discuss this face to face.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,872

26
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,033
( Sighs ) It's too hot.

27
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,569
Would you settle for a leg?

28
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,171
I'd be grateful.

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,308
It's cold

30
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,343

31
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,312
I'm the softest.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,601

37
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,469
I'm already late.

38
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,471
For what?

39
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,440
Secor laxatives.

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,578
Did I spoil the mood?

42
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,680
What do you have to do?

43
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:37,283
I have a 4:00 at Erwin Wasey.

44
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,385
Doing what?

45
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,321
I can't tell you that, Mr. Bond.

46
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,790
I told you.

47
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,226
What are you working on over there?

48
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,961
I don't tell 'em what I'm doing for you.

49
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,165
You're not lying in bed
with them right now either.

50
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,568
Do you know what a Chinese wall is?

51
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,140
I really should go.

52
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,079
Can I get in the bathroom first?

53
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,214
Just take your time.

54
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,055
Let yourself out.

55
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,525
Lock the door behind you as a courtesy.

56
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,761
You wanna leave me here?

57
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,997
You sure?

58
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,101

60
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,244
I don't understand. Do you honestly think

61
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:39,512
my book isn't better than Ogilvy's?

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,180
Mine's got a story.

63
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,117
It's got mystery, intrigue, romance.

64

84
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,002
You had to tell me that in person?

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,339
- So depressing.
- He doesn't want a memo circulating.

86
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,240
He's afraid people will stop working.

87

What are you doing in August?

every afternoon... Working...

Which is what I'm trying to do right now.

92

Jesus. I'm sorry.

What does that have to do with you?

97

went for a swim.

Come back in an hour. I'm taking a nap.

I was gonna stop by your office,
but I didn't want to get you in trouble.

from everything falling apart
in every society. It's so tenuous.

All these corporations just throw
their money at everyone

'cause the people outnumber them.

But in the blink of an eye,
they could overturn everything.

177
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,199
- Me too.
- I don't hear it.

178
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,201
One more drink and it'll come out.

179
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,970
( Chuckles ) Okay.

180
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,675
What am I talking to you
about corporations for?

181
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,511
- You must deal with them all the time.
- I guess.

182
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,847
Vick chemical, American tobacco,

183
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,949
but most of them are family businesses...

184
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,518
Samsonite, Fillmore Auto Parts,

185
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,321
- sugarberry...
- Fillmore Auto Parts is worse than a corporation,

186
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,356
- what with the boycott and all.
- What boycott?

187
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,592
The southern stores won't hire negroes.

188
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,894
Says who?

189
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,130
It was in "The voice."
It was in a couple of places.

190
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,932
I don't think that's true.
I would've heard that.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,701
It is true.

192
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,404
That doesn't seem like them.

193
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:14,707
I'm sure they're perfectly nice
for racists, you know,

194
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,110
and obviously your company has
an investment in looking the other way.

195
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,515
Well, it's a complicated idea,

196
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,750
but in advertising,

197
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,452
we don't really judge people.

198
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,387
We try and help them
out of these situations.

199
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,856
Certainly we would try and stop this.

200
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,925
If it's true, it's not good
for their business.

201
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,795
Jesus, I don't even know where to start.

202
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,830
You would've done a campaign for Goldwater?

203
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,232
You kidding?
That would've been spectacular.

204
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,235
- Did you vote for him?
- Of course not.

205
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,337
Wha... civil rights isn't a situation

206
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,907
to be fixed with some P.R. campaign.

207
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,576
It's an inequality that
the world has its eyes on.

208
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,344
I know.

209
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,582
But I have to say

210
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,651
most of the things negroes can't do

211
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,486
I can't do either

212
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,455
and nobody seems to care.

213
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,390
What are you talking about?

214
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,692
Half of the meetings
take place over golf, tennis,

215
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,829
in a bunch of clubs where
I'm not allowed to be a member

216
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,731
or even enter.

217
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,667
The university club said the only way
I could eat dinner there

218
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,835
was if I arrived in a cake.

219
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,904
There's no negro copywriters, you know.

220
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm sure they could fight
their way in like I did.

221
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,043
Believe me, nobody wanted me there.

222
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,779
All right, Peggy.

223
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,314
We'll have a civil rights march for women.

224
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,021
I have a really early day.

225
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,389
It was nice to see you again.

226
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,625
Wait. Hey hey hey. I'm just saying

227
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,927
they're not shooting women
to keep 'em from voting. That's all.

228
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,664
Oh, Jesus. I'm really sorry.

229
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,867
I'm much better on paper.

230
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,470
You're opinionated
and you're criticizing me.

231
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,305
That's not what I'm doing.
This is discourse.

232
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,975
I knew I shouldn't have let Joyce leave.

233
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,977
Have a good night.

234
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,375
A three-letter word for a flightless bird.

235
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,010
Emu.

236
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,778
Nope. It starts with an "l."

237
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,547
The hell it does.

238
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,917
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

239
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,885
Could I get some coffee?
And let me know when Dr. Miller arrives.

240
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,588
It's hard... The way she breezes past me.

241
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,629
She's pushy, that one.

242
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,698
I guess that's what it takes.

243
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,403
- Morning.
- Good morning.

244
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,839
- And thank you.
- For what?

245
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,674
That was very thoughtful.

246
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:44,844
I knew I was rubbing you the wrong way,

247
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:48,214
so I thought, why not have
someone rub you the right way?

248
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,283
- I brought you bear claws.
- Caroline won't let me have one

249
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,252
unless it's on the end of a real bear.

250
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,522
- Well, anyway.
- Joanie.

251
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:01,193
- It'll be okay.
- People love to say that.

252
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,996
Look, I know you're having a tough run.

253
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,600
Let me get you a meal, hmm?

254
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,201
Take your mind off things?

255
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,404
Of course.

256
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,941
I forgot for a second that you're
incapable of doing something nice

257
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,877
without expecting something
nicer in return.

258
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,712
I didn't mean anything by it.

259
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,414
Honest.

260
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,115
Just thought you could use a night out.

261
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,785
- Thank you. I'm fine.
- Good.

262
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,329
- What are you doing here?
- I wrote something.

263
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,231
I kind of wrote it for you.

264
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,601
I would love it if you read it.

265
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,906
"Nuremberg on Madison Avenue"?

266
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,911
- What is this?
- It's what I was trying to say last night,

267
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,380
but without, I don't know,
my abrasive tone.

268
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,749
- Read it.
- Right now in front of you?

269
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,118
Nah. Take your time.
I'll wait over here.

270
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,620
I have a lot to do.

271
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,989
I came all the way up here. I want
to know what you think, okay?

272
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,365
These domesticated suburbanites

273
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,868
still have a primitive desire
to get their hands dirty,

274
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:19,405
but have they have become so
removed from nature that they can't.

275
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,373
They don't know how to hunt
or swing a hammer

276
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,709
- or fix their cars.
- You mean like these two.

277
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,912
Actually, no. I'm from Vermont

278
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,982
and Don's a competitive fly fisherman.

279
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,185
What our findings show
is that this demographic

280
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,321
will spend a good amount of money

281
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,289
for the satisfaction of being useful
with their hands.

282
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,659
Ladies love a man
who's good with his hands.

283
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,096
You think a mechanic
comes in and sees these jokers

284
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,798
looking at fan belts,
he's gonna stick around?

285
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,102
- No offense.
- What's the difference?

286
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,470
Our inventory's the same.

287
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,772
I think if they see
a coat and tie on aisle 4,

288
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,342
they'll think our prices went up.
I know I would.

289
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,745
Listen, salt of the earth, we need
more than mechanics to survive.

290
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,747
<i>You ever hear of Sears?
They'll kill us.</i>

291
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,582
We agreed we all had to agree.

292
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,618
Don't we have enough problems
with the boycott?

293
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,854
Look, I don't want to get involved

294
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,990
in a family squabble,
but I can't move forward

295
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,491
until you agree on a strategy.

296
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,395
What if there were a way
to market to both groups?

297
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,464
"Fillmore Auto Parts.

298
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:21,367
Where the pros go and everyone's welcome."

299
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,670
- It's a little corny.
- It's great and you know it.

300
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,206
That's not a strategy.
That's two strategies

301
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,474
connected by the word "and."

302
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,509
I can do "where the pros go"

303
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,545
or I can do "everyone's welcome,"

304
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,880
- but not both.
- Sure you can.

305
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,422
Someone has to make a decision.
There are three of you.

306
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,858
- Vote.
- ( Megan whispering )

307
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,159
Sean, what do you think?

308
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:50,162
I d-d-d-d...

309
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,832
D-d-d-don't know.

310
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,367
<i>Don: What?</i>

311
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:57,336
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

312
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,238
Continue, please.

313
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,576
<i>( Door opens )</i>

314
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,345
Why d-d-do we

315
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,080
have to c-c-convince him?

316
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,017
What are you doing here?

317
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,722
I wanted to see you.

318
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,091
I am so sorry. Who are you?

319
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,660
My name is Vivian Winters

320
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,696
and I'm going to assume you're her father

321
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,264
since that's what she's led me to believe.

322
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,266
Don. What exactly is going on?

323
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,602
I found her on the train between carriages

324
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,637
trying to avoid the conductor.

325
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,772
I didn't have enough money.

326
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,109
Megan, could you take her to my office?

327
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:39,411
Go.

328
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,318
Thank you.

329
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,087
Can I pay you for the ticket and your time?

330
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,055
You're just very lucky I ran into her

331
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:51,890
before someone else did.

332
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,827
The types on that train?
Someone should keep track of her.

333
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,196
You're right. I didn't know.

334
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:00,032
Men never know what's going on.

335
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,235
- I offered you money and I said thank you.
- ( Sighs )

336
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,444
She looks so chubby in the pictures.

337
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,113
Get her mother on the phone now.

338
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,754
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,090
I wanted to see you and I didn't
want to wait two weekends.

340
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:29,161
Well, you can't do this.
This is very serious.

341
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,230
<i>- ( Intercom buzzes )
- Blankenship: Mrs. Francis on the line.</i>

342
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:37,636
- Guess who's sitting on my couch right now.
- What are you talking about?

343
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,606
I'm talking about a stranger
bringing Sally to my office

344
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,108
<i>- because she got on the train with no money.
- You're kidding.</i>

345
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,210
Carla was supposed to pick her up
after the doctor.

346
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,280
- How the hell did this happen?
- Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her

347
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,316
to walk from camp to her
appointment by herself.

348
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,851
Great idea. Thank you, psychiatry.

349
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,554
Don't yell at me.
She needs to learn responsibility.

350
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,756
<i>You need to learn responsibility.</i>

351
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,692
Now come get her.
I've got a business to run here.

352
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,695
Because it's so easy.
It's so much fun to take care of her.

353
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,296
Enjoy.

354
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,365
- What?
- Enjoy, Don.

355
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,901
I'm meeting Henry in the city
tomorrow night. I'll get her then.

356
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:17,009
Don't move and don't touch anything.

357
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:20,145
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

358
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,247
I don't want to hear it. Just make sure
she doesn't leave that room.

359
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,116
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

360
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,880
- Hey.
- ( Whispers )
Are you serious with this?

361
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,688
Everyone knows who represents
Fillmore Auto Parts.

362
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,324
- We're the agency of record.
- But I was defending you.

363
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,392
We have a religion in this country

364
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,261
and it's business. You're not a priest.

365
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,362
You're just another congregant.

366
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,230
So I'm not a war criminal.

367
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:57,133
Look, why should someone nice
like you have to do this?

368
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,868
Why should you be a part
of that corruption?

369
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,438
It's a waste of your
and a million other artists' gifts.

370
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,740
If you publish this, I'll lose my job.

371
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,141
Maybe you're better than this.

372
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,578
I'm not a political person.

373
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,447
I don't have to defend myself.

374
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,317
You're political whether you like it or not.

375
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,187
And you're not supposed to be insulted.

376
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,489
- You're supposed to be flattered.
- Are you crazy?

377
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:23,026
You inspired me. I wrote this for you.

378
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,161
I guess I read you wrong.

379
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,466
You look so earnest.

380
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,768
I need your word that you'll destroy that.

381
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,004
Sure.

382
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,172
I won't bother you again.

383
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,679
( Dings )

384
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,651
Miss Blankenship.

385
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,158
Miss Blankenship, are you all right?

386
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,963
Miss Blankenship.

387
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,099
Miss Blankenship.

388
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,635

389
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,371

390
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,779
<i>- Oh. Do not come out of there.
- I know!</i>

391
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:22,552
- What now?
- Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

392
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,021
- I'm really sorry to bother you again.
- ( Sighs )

393
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,893
<i>- ( Door closes )
- Are you sure?</i>

394
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,062
- I'm afraid so.
- What happened?

395
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,565
( Crying )

396
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,836
Jesus.

397
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,006
Poor thing.

398
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,041
Should we call an ambulance?

399
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,012
The coroner.

400
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,481
What about them?

401
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,786
- I'll attend to this.
- Sally's in there.

402
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,456
- Why?
- She's visiting.

403
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,401
Megan, get a man, and we'll need a blanket.

404
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,537
There's an afghan on Mr. Crane's couch.

405
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,542
She seemed fine just a minute ago.

406
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:32,422
So where are we?

407
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,059
- Have we agreed on a strategy?
- I'm not sure.

408
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,495
<i>This is where we are.</i>

409
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,131
<i>Correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen,</i>

410
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:44,367
but we believe by holding onto
Fillmore's reputation

411
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,803
as a place for professional mechanics,

412
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,672
<i>we can actually attract men of all types.</i>

413
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,008
So it's something like

414
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,778
"Fillmore Auto Parts.

415
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,846
For the mechanic in every man."

416
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,482
And although it seems immaterial to you,

417
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,153
- the Fillmore brothers like it.
- Unanimously.

418
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,924
What was that again?

419
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,194
Fillmore Auto Parts.

420
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:12,929
"For the mechanic in every man."

421
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:29,813
My mother made that.

422
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,286
Can we get your signature?

423
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,087
- ( Clears throat )
- I'm the president.

424
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,637
I think this is a winner.

425
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:57,540
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

426
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:00,376
Ken, can you show them out?

427
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:01,644
Of course. This way.

428
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:13,556
My goodness. I was just talking to her.

429
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,895
Listen, my daughter
is sitting in my office.

430
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:21,497
- What?
- She decided to run away today.

431
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,566
- Sally?
- I'd really appreciate it

432
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,069
if you could go in my bag,
get my keys, take her to my apartment

433
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,804
and just... Sit with her.

434
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,505
Are you sure?

435
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:32,108
I would have my secretary do it,
but she's dead.

436
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,110
No, of course.

437
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,679
Okay, do you want to introduce me?

438
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,681
I mean, what do I say to her?

439
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,683
Do we really have to have
this discussion right now?

440
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,885
You're Faye.

441
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,823
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch

442
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,825
and stop them from bringing
Secor back here.

443
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:49,893
<i>( Door opens )</i>

444
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,496
Sally, this is my friend Faye.

445

She's going to take you to my apartment.

446
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,901
- Why?
- You don't want this to get worse, believe me.

447
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:08,611
Hello. My name is Faye.

448
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,714
I know. My dad just said that.

449
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,993
Stop.

450
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,763
- Where are they taking her?
- She's going to the morgue.

451
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,865
No, she's not.
She's going to Frank E. Campbell.

452
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:38,041
Anyone track down her family?

453
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,810
She has a niece. I'll call her.

454
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,645
I'm sorry, Bert.

455
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,188
Roger.

456
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,662
You should go home.

457
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,768
Yes. Take all my calls up here.

00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,070

Stop it.

If it looks like I'm going, open a window.

No chance of running into anyone

I know it's tough,

but he must've known about
the possibilities when he signed up.

503
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:57,806
I wasn't consulted.

504
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,274
You're kidding.

505
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:04,012
Because you always tell Jane
about all of your decisions?

506
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,248
She's the woman behind the man, isn't she?

507
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,919
Did you listen to my memoirs?

508
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,221
I just have them transcribed

509
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,457
and recycle the tapes.

510
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,859
And you're not a little curious
if there's a chapter called "Joan"?

511

There'd better not be.

- No.
- She had your keys.

00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,528
Please. I can't bring her back

700
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:40,297
kicking and screaming to her mother.

701
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:42,065
I don't have much child psychology.

702
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,067
Just talk to her.

703
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,569
<i>( Door opens )</i>

704
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:50,674
Dr. Faye wants to talk to you.

705
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:54,744
Hi, Sally.

706
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:56,513
Remember me from yesterday?

707
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,120
I know you don't want to go,
but you have to.

708
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:07,691
- Your mother came all the way out here.
- You don't know my mother.

709
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,292
Sally.

710
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,930
Sally,

711
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,700
sometimes we have to do things
we don't want to do.

712
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,202
- Shut up.
- What's gotten into you?

713
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,138
- I don't think I'm helping here.
- We don't want your help.

714
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:26,309
- Let's go, now.
- Stop it! No! Stop it!

715
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,197
It's gonna be all right.

716
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:49,532
No, it's not.

717
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,206
I fall all the time.

718
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,878
I was coming to get you.

719
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:04,714
Mrs.... Your...

720
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,583
Sally's mother is in reception.

721
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,253
Thank you.

722
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,733
I was worried about you.

723
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,013
Come on, let's go.

724
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:38,648
I was waiting in the lobby at 5:00.

725
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:41,685
- We lost track of time.
- Well, now I'm late.

726
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,056
Sally?

727
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:49,259
- Say goodbye to your father.
- Goodbye.

728
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,064
Excuse me.

729
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,069
Thank you.

730
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:13,216
Hi. Are you here to see Peggy?

731
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:21,725
( Sighs )

732
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,593
Can you make me one of those?

733
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:27,597
No. No, I can't.

734
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,736
- I can't do anything for you.
- Why are you upset?

735
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,471
You shouldn't have put me in that position.

736
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:37,741
Things happen. I didn't plan it.

737
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,342
You asked me to go watch her.

738
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,211
There was no one else to do it.

739
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:44,013
And just now? What the hell was that?

740
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:46,383
I'm not good with kids.

741
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,585
That was not your fault.

742
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,121
<i>Well, it feels like there was
a test and I failed it.</i>

743
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:55,859
God knows I'd be lying

744
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:57,594
if I said it didn't cross my mind:

745
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:00,230
Would I meet your children?
When would I meet your children?

746
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:02,532
But I don't have any.

747
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:15,812
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,516
I love children, but I chose
to be where I am.

749
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:23,253
I don't view it as a failure.

750
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,088
It doesn't matter.

751
00:43:28,225 --> 00:43:30,193
I mean it.

752
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,102
Jesus. What a mess.

753
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,240
Part of it's good, right?

754
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:49,345
Yeah.

755
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:02,025
I'm gonna go. I didn't really sleep.

756
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:08,998
We can have dinner this weekend.
I'll pick a place.

757
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,533
Good.

758
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,947
<i>( Door closes )</i>

759
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:36,826
<i>Joyce:
Why are you drinking here?</i>

760
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:39,195
Come on.

761
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:42,365
<i>I don't know what kind of surprise
you're gonna spring on me.</i>

762
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:46,603
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.

763
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,238
It's to be expected.

764
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:51,140
He seemed so nice.

765
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:54,944
He's a man. He won't be happy
until he turns you out.

766
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:56,312
What's that supposed to mean?

767
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,448
Gotta be their girl.

768
00:44:58,516 --> 00:45:02,085
It's the way they want it.
Maybe it's biology.

769
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:05,021
It's like men are this vegetable soup

770
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:08,157
and we can't put 'em on a plate
or eat 'em off the counter.

771
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:11,060
So women are the pot. They heat 'em up.

772
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,196
They hold 'em. They contain them.

773
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,400
But who wants to be a pot?

774
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:19,402
<i>Who the hell said we're not soup?</i>

775
00:45:20,738 --> 00:45:22,472
I don't think that's true.

776
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,541
It's been my experience.

777
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:29,412
But you know, I wouldn't
have helped Abe out

778
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,148
if I didn't think he was
some very interesting soup.

779
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:37,387
Listen, go ahead without me.

780
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:39,522
Another time.

781
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,624
Are you angry or lovesick?

782
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,193
I don't know.

783
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,797
Night, Peg.
