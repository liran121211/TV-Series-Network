( taps )

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,061
I'm sorry to bother you,

5
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,831
but we're the people
who paid for your meal,

6
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,636
and as much as I am committed
to you enjoying your food

7
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,444
while it's still piping hot,

8
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,680
I do have a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

9
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:57,913
I'll give you
the $3.10 back.

10
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,819
I have to beat my husband home.

11
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,557
Would your husband be
happy if you were late,

12
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:03,894
but had another $10?

13
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:06,165
Well, I guess it would help.

14
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:08,877
Good evening, ma'am.

15
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,048
What's your name, little girl?

16
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,751
It's Stacy.
Is that your question?

17
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:15,286
Would you say that you eat
here weekly, monthly?

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,928
Too much.

19
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:20,302
What's your favorite
thing about Burger Chef?

20
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,073
The taste or the price?

21
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,676
- It's near my house.
- Convenience.

22
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,714
Usually.

23
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,590
Does your husband
ever pick it up?

24
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:33,229
Oh, he wouldn't do that. It's bad
enough that I'm not making dinner.

25
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:35,536
Is that all?

26
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,285
Come back soon.

27
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,958
How much money do you have?

28
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:51,164
Two more families
and Chinese for us.

29
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:02,174
It's not a listing.
It's Sybil's apartment.

30
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,875
I'm not squatting.

31
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,508
I can afford a hotel.

32
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,677
It's seven nights.

33
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,586
I'm not paying for it, <i>bonita</i>.

34
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,020
Let me at least pay for
the theater tickets.

35
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,687
I get them for free.

36
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,391
Well, I'm going to buy you a
pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.

37
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:23,928
I want you shopping all day...

38
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:26,900
and screwing all night.

39
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,971
You'll spend the weekend
with me, won't you?

40
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,706
I will need to spend

41
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:33,876
some of Saturday
afternoon in Cos Cob.

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,778
Well, I'll come.

43
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:37,582
Why would you want to do that?

44
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,118
I sure would like
to meet Tammy.

45
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,786
I picked out her Barbie.

46
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:44,557
I don't want
to confuse her, baby.

47
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,060
She's probably more confused

48
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:47,996
that her parents
aren't actually divorced.

49
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,064
So that's something
that bothers you.

50
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,802
Of course it bothers me.

51
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,477
I don't know
where this is going,

52
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,678
but I don't want it to
fail on account of delay.

53
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,048
I haven't seen her in a while.

54
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,988
Next time...
I promise.

55
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:12,127
I thought you were never
going to get married again.

56
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:24,546
Meet me in the restroom
in 60 seconds.

57
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,884
I've always wanted to do that.

58
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:53,914
( TV playing )

59
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,152
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'll have a roll at the office.

60
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:01,785
Well, you're disappearing.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,721
Every time you say
something like that,

62
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,323
I go off my diet.

63
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,662
( TV off )

64
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,964
Go outdoors today, please.

65
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,137
( clicking )

66
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,608
I hope I'm not interrupting?
It's Bonnie.

67
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,074
I remember you.

68
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,044
You can't just walk in here.

69
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,313
Bonnie, this is Meredith.

70
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:30,249
Do you want me to come and
get you in five minutes?

71
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,253
Meredith, that'll be all.

72
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:37,627
Pete's having quite a homecoming,
so I thought I'd duck in.

73
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,295
You're the only one
I know here.

74
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,029
How long are you in town?

75
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,365
I hate to say it, but I
knew where to find you.

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,768
- Don, how are you?
- Good to see you.

77
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:48,136
I like what you've
done with the place.

78
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:49,803
I heard you have
quite the home.

79
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,371
Pete says it's
2,000 square feet.

80
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,307
Not quite.

81
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:57,146
Peggy's going to be leading us
through the work, as it were.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,814
I assume you're attending?

83
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,482
- Burger Chef?
- You're on the team.

84
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:02,983
I'd like you to be there.

85
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,987
I guess this is my cue.

86
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:09,321
Baloney. Walk me to
the conference room.

87
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,156
He wants to make sure
everyone's seen you.

88
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,058
( chuckles )

89
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,296
- Ta-ta.
- Very well.

90
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,001
Is this the billboard?

91
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,636
It's kind of lackluster.

92
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,607
That's the tray liner.

93
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,576
- That's everything, chief.
- Thank you, Stan.

94
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,576
- Hello, Stan.
- Good to see you, Pete.

95
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:36,709
How's life treating you?

96
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,543
I'm in New York
and I'm in love.

97
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:39,977
Me as well.

98
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,345
Hello, Pete.

99
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,181
Well, I think we should
get this started.

100
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:48,183
Did you need something, Don?

101
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,785
I've asked Don to join us.

102
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:53,622
I didn't know
you wanted the team.

103
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:54,789
Should we get Mathis as well?

104
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,590
No, Don's plenty.

105
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,660
Well, he has been instrumental.

106
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,003
I think we're
circling a strategy--

107
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,041
all the research
points to the fact

108
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,578
that mothers feel guilty.

109
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,344
They don't eat
at the restaurant

110
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,413
because of what Mathis calls
a "cleanliness fetish."

111
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:16,782
( chuckles )

112
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,886
And even when they get home,
they're embarrassed.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,756
Our job is to turn Burger Chef

114
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,124
into a special treat
served with love.

115
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:24,993
So the more these women
go to Burger Chef,

116
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,964
- the worse they feel.
- Yes.

117
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:29,298
We need to address how to
give homemakers permission.

118
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,932
Well, who gives
moms permission? Dads.

119
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,541
It's a dark night.
Reveal our mom, driving,

120
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,344
girl in a tutu next to her,

121
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:41,212
boy wearing a football
helmet in the back.

122
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:44,683
Push into a close-up
as we hear Mom's voice--

123
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,520
the things on her mind.

124
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:49,522
"Let's see, check that list for
the marching band fundraiser.

125
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,591
Get the sink trap checked.

126
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,728
Get Jim to take down
the storm windows.

127
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,630
( gasps )
Jim!

128
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,431
Jim will be home
in a half an hour."

129
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:00,899
Just then the little
girl says, "I'm hungry."

130
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,636
The boy says,
"I'm starving."

131
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:06,438
Mom says,
"One more stop."

132
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:09,040
We see the reflection
of the Burger Chef sign

133
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,776
on the station wagon
windshield as she pulls in.

134
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,045
Mom gets out of the car.

135
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,180
A handsome man comes out
holding a bag.

136
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,883
Mom walks up to him
and gives him a deep kiss.

137
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,189
The kids in the car
looking surprised.

138
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:26,957
He laughs and says,
"Can I take you to dinner?"

139
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:30,093
She says, "Next time,
let me get dinner.

140
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:31,730
You take down
the storm windows."

141
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,700
( chuckling )

142
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:35,802
Cut to them
at the kitchen table,

143
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:38,838
camera moving from face
to smiling face.

144
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,243
They're laughing,
Mom looks around, smiling.

145
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,646
VO, "Aren't you glad

146
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,148
everybody loves Burger Chef
as much as you do?"

147
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:52,018
Very nice. I think
it's coming along.

148
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,255
It's nice to see
family happiness again.

149
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,288
Thank you.

150
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,131
What do you think?

151
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:08,208
Dad surprising the family
absolves the mom.

152
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,777
It's right on strategy.
It's exactly what they wanted.

153
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,251
Don worked the tag over
by the syllable.

154
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,786
- It's deceptively simple.
- Thank you.

155
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,219
Why don't you take us
through the legs?

156
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,590
Let's start with radio.

157
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:27,230
Looky here.
A sight for sore eyes.

158
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:31,198
Ah...

159
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:33,631
Hello, Jim.

160
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,332
How's your Burger Chef
work going?

161
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,001
Better than yours, I guess.

162
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,703
Thank you, by the way, for failing
and giving us a shot at it.

163
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,606
It's not McDonald's.
It's run by morons.

164
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,442
A lot of companies
succeed that way.

165
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,409
But look who I'm talking to.

166
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:49,978
You don't mean that.
You're going after fast food,

167
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,283
you've got
your little car--

168
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,486
it's not Buick, but it's cute.

169
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,786
I know you folks want to be just
like McCann when you grow up.

170
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,754
When we grow up, we're going to
kill you and marry your wife.

171
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,293
( chuckles ) Listen, I hear
you're talking to Philip Morris.

172
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,394
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?

173
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,365
Well, I'm just curious how you think
you're going to pull that off

174
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,267
with Don Draper
haunting your halls.

175
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,635
( sighs )

176
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,136
You're so lucky my problems
aren't your problems.

177
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,140
What if I wanted them to be?

178
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,775
Are you looking for a job?

179
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,909
No. No.
I'm just looking

180
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,645
to enrich the lives
of people I respect.

181
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,846
The New York Athletic Club
frowns on people

182
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,948
making advances
in their steam room.

183
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,353
I was kidding around,

184
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:37,223
but I think you're
making eyes at me.

185
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,630
I'm gonna go get a massage,
relieve some of this tension.

186
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,900
Fellas, we got a live one here.

187
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,407
Come in, join us

188
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,843
I'm drinking rum.
Do you want some?

189
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:57,682
- No, thank you.
- That bar, it's hysterical.

190
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,818
My wife's a card.

191
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,355
I'm very pleased with the
direction I saw this morning.

192
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,956
- We all are.
- Thank you.

193
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,859
And-- not but--

194
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:09,993
I think with my understanding
of George Payton,

195
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,926
that our success would
be further assured

196
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,163
if Don delivered
the presentation.

197
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,866
- Oh.
- Here's the but.

198
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,634
It is completely your decision.

199
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,536
Why are you doing this now?

200
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,374
That's what I said.
She's doing fine.

201
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:31,108
Lou, first of all, you've
never seen Don at his best.

202
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:33,246
It'll be a tearjerker.

203
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,348
Number two is Peggy, in my
mind, will still speak,

204
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,514
but as the mother.
A change of tone.

205
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:40,915
You were wonderful in there.

206
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,317
I don't like
being in this position.

207
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,352
I know I can bring this home.

208
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:49,454
Peggy, you didn't walk into
this office and see Don here.

209
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,855
This is your client,

210
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,323
and you're going to write as
much of it as you want to.

211
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,758
Don will give authority,
you will give emotion.

212
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:59,593
I have authority.
And Don has emotion.

213
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:02,163
I prefer you
as an expert witness.

214
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:05,034
- You will introduce him.
- Intercom: <i>But it's your decision.</i>

215
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:07,103
- What?
- <i> It's Ted.</i>

216
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,906
Ted's on the phone.

217
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,076
Oh.

218
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,678
Hello.

219
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,717
I've seen the work so far.
I'm impressed.

220
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,351
And what would<i> you</i> do?

221
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,454
I would use everything
at my disposal to win it.

222
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,397
If you think George Payton
will prefer it,

223
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:29,501
I'm not going to ignore that.

224
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,572
You know that she's
every bit as good

225
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,509
as any woman in this business!

226
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:35,676
I do.

227
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:41,046
He'll be great.

228
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:46,152
Keep up the good work.

229
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:56,925
It's big and powerful and costs a
fortune, but it can't make coffee.

230
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,593
They've got a computer
twice that size

231
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:01,394
working on the
engine for the XP.

232
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,961
- Clara?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.

233
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:06,294
Gentlemen, there's coffee and
cake in Mr. Crane's office.

234
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,329
May I take your hats?

235
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,332
Hey, fellas.

236
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,200
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.

237
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,702
- Hello, Kenny.
- How's the kid? Is he flying yet?

238
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,869
Are you kidding? He's
crawling all over the place.

239
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,571
You've really got
to keep an eye on him.

240
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,775
Joan!
Come say hello.

241
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,909
Welcome back, Bob.
Gentlemen.

242
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:28,114
How the hell did we end up
with him instead of you?

243
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,151
- No one asked.
- This is Bill Hartley.

244
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,086
Bill's been bumped
to vice president of brand.

245
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,454
Congratulations.

246
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,291
You certainly picked the
right place to celebrate.

247
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:39,094
You mean New York City
or this very spot?

248
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:40,729
( laughs )

249
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,099
So far all we have lined up

250
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,533
is six hours of network pilots.

251
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:46,102
Clara, could you take
them to Harry's office?

252
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,471
- Enjoy.
- Very funny.

253
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,406
Pleasure, ma'am.

254
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,208
I'd love to see you Sunday.

255
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:55,942
Unless you've made plans
with some married guy.

256
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:58,914
I am all yours.

257
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,550
But if you want to see Kevin, you're
going to have to see my mother.

258
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:04,217
I want to see everyone.

259
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,760
- You need something?
- Yes, actually, I do.

260
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,496
I've given it careful thought,

261
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,199
and I think you should give the
presentation to Burger Chef.

262
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,936
Hold on.

263
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,371
You did a great job
this morning.

264
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,208
That's good to hear,
but I want to have

265
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,677
the best chance
of winning this,

266
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,846
and I'm not going to
pretend you're not it.

267
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:35,215
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

268
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,916
I'll introduce you, and
when you're rounding third,

269
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,150
you hand it off
to "the voice of moms."

270
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:43,421
And then you turn and hit the tag
like you just thought of it.

271
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,423
- Do I do that?
- Yes, you do.

272
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:51,090
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

273
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,256
Thank you.

274
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:57,526
You know, I was just noodling
around with the idea

275
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,894
of seeing the whole thing
from the kids' perspective.

276
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:03,064
- "Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?"
- Excuse me?

277
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:04,534
I don't know.
Just a thought.

278
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,668
I appreciate it, but we
already have a strategy.

279
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,838
<i>( door closes )</i>

280
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:18,745
Megan?

281
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,646
Hello!

282
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,284
Oh, I'm sorry.

283
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,120
Why didn't you say something?

284
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,654
No, Marsha, this is
Megan, Don's wife.

285
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:31,622
I didn't know he was married.

286
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,258
So nice to meet you.

287
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,094
Marsha, can you
get Megan some coffee?

288
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,997
I'm fine.

289
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,333
This is very impressive,
but where do you work now?

290
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,669
My office is right here.

291
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,344
- Are you a surprise?
- No, he's expecting me.

292
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:52,080
Well, you're a surprise for me.

293
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,983
How is everything in LA?

294
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:57,325
It's exciting
and new and different.

295
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,062
And a lot quieter.

296
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:02,930
What a great office.

297
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,532
Sooner or later you're going
to get Don's, aren't you?

298
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,937
I don't know
how much better it is.

299
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,071
He's right next door.

300
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:12,639
Oh.

301
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:14,207
Hey!

302
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,209
I didn't expect to see you.

303
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:19,080
- Peggy: Megan's in for a visit.
- Thanks for the subtitles.

304
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,047
- Did you hear about Ginsberg?
- Yes. Have you seen him?

305
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,415
I did.
She won't go.

306
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:25,984
Don: <i>All right,
Meredith, I'm gonna go.</i>

307
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:28,218
Don?

308
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,185
What are you doing here?

309
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,018
I couldn't wait to see you.

310
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:33,886
I thought
we could eat downtown.

311
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,021
That's a great idea.

312
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,759
Well, it was so great
to see you both.

313
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,695
Is it okay?
I have a visitor.

314
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,628
Enjoy yourself.

315
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:47,228
Good night.

316
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,633
I miss her.

317
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:57,272
You didn't even ask me
how the dry run went.

318
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,007
Was there a problem?

319
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,575
No, they loved it.

320
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:03,810
Are you mad at me?

321
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:07,049
No.
Good night, Stan.

322
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,751
Good night.

323
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:19,165
Ah, good, you're still here.

324
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,833
That's your opinion.

325
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,134
I played a round this
morning with Les Clark--

326
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,869
my friend from Philip Morris?

327
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,138
The brand commander
of Commander brand.

328
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:29,473
Your name came up
and I sure would appreciate

329
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:31,609
you helping us pave that road.

330
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,812
Your secret plan
to win the war?

331
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:36,118
Stop thinking about Don

332
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,456
and start thinking
about the company.

333
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,625
( ringing )

334
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,933
Who's here for William Hartley?

335
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,465
- Bill?
- Don't say anything.

336
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,734
But you should say thank
you to your boyfriend

337
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,736
- for posting bail.
- Has he seen a doctor?

338
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,504
- What did I just say?
- Take him to a headshrinker.

339
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,173
He tried to fellate
an undercover officer.

340
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,645
May I go?

341
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:23,520
Good night,
"ladies."

342
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:29,557
<i>( distant siren wails )</i>

343
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,360
I called you because
I knew you could keep this to yourself.

344
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:37,265
You should go to the hospital.

345
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,736
You know they're just
going to call the cops.

346
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,038
( sighs ) I wish I
was back in Detroit.

347
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:47,376
I've got that place wired.

348
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,383
Have you ever been arrested?

349
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,885
No.
Never.

350
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,392
I guess you've been lucky.

351
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,497
Well, I appreciate this.

352
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:04,002
I'm going to miss
having you around.

353
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,735
I am not of your stripe.

354
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,206
And you should think twice before
you threaten me like that.

355
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,375
Please.
I'm not threatening you.

356
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,980
We're moving the XP over to
Campbell-Ewald, and you're moving on.

357
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,918
- We're losing Chevy?
- Don't worry.

358
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:27,752
GM loves the work,
and they really love you.

359
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,352
Obviously not.

360
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:31,655
Your agency had
a successful tryout,

361
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,759
but the plan was always
to take the XP in-house.

362
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:38,894
But Buick is going
to come to<i> you</i>

363
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:40,961
with a great job offer.

364
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,630
What?

365
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,503
Well, that's very good news.

366
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,612
- When does all this happen?
- Imminently.

367
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,480
What about you?

368
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,582
I'm gonna call in sick.

369
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,454
My wife understands, thank God.

370
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,194
That's a good idea.

371
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,536
How did you live in this city?

372
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,709
There's so much temptation.

373
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,282
It was hard.

374
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,758
( sighs )

375
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,120
( birds chirping )

376
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,988
Hello?

377
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:14,756
Trudy?

378
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,026
Come along, let's go say hi.

379
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,467
Hello, sweetie.

380
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:24,101
It's Daddy, sweetheart.

381
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,074
I got you a Barbie all
the way from California.

382
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,442
Go ahead.

383
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,009
I don't believe we've met.

384
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,746
- Where's Trudy?
- She's at the hairdresser.

385
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,115
I'm Verna.

386
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,752
Well, Verna's going to
come with us to the car.

387
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:30,296
Tell me it was all a dream.

388
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,565
You're in a good mood.

389
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,235
Tell me you didn't miss this.

390
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,876
I missed you.

391
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:45,313
Well, we're going to eat
this delicious breakfast,

392
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:49,183
and I'm going
to take you shopping.

393
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:51,620
Okay.

394
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:20,148
( ringing )

395
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,181
Hey, baby, I'm almost ready.

396
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,919
"Hi, baby" yourself. I've
been here since 10:00.

397
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:28,322
- Oh, it's you.
- Are you coming in?

398
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,190
Find something else to do today.
That's an order.

399
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,923
I don't like the idea.

400
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:34,289
Of doing something else?

401
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,823
No, the idea for Burger Chef.

402
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,359
You haven't been "noodling"
with anything else, have you?

403
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:42,364
It came easy.
You don't trust it.

404
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:45,635
- It didn't come easy at all.
- So find a new one.

405
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,471
So<i> you</i> don't like it either.

406
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,972
The work is great!

407
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,172
I'm positive,
exclamation point!

408
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,639
How do I know you're not
just saying that

409
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,106
so you don't have to come in?

410
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,006
( sighs )

411
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,973
Do you need me to come in?

412
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,376
No.

413
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,376
Your "baby's" calling.

414
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,310
But we both know
there's a better idea.

415
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,383
There's always a better idea.

416
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,184
Bye.

417
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,187
<i>( TV playing )</i>

418
00:23:22,324 --> 00:23:24,791
Look at you.

419
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,994
You say goodbye to your daddy, and
then you're going to take a bath.

420
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,331
- Where's Trudy?
- She's out, Mr. Campbell.

421
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,534
Her car's in the drive.

422
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:34,675
Well, she came back,
but then she went out.

423
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,382
Why don't you give Tammy a
bath and let me tuck her in?

424
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,620
Of course,
Mr. Campbell.

- Hello?
- Hello, dear.

427
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:54,239
I'm afraid I've been
waylaid in Cos Cob.

428
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,444
You go without me. I'll pick
you up for a drink after.

429
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,846
You really want me to see "Oh!
Calcutta!" by myself?

430
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,649
Trudy must've forgotten.

431
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,188
There's no one
to look after Tammy.

432
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:09,756
Oh.

433
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,459
That's rather
inconsiderate, isn't it?

434
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:14,467
I'm sure it's just a mistake.

435
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:18,137
Well, I'm going to wait
until the very last minute.

436
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:21,871
That's sweet.
I'll make it up to you.

437
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:24,208
You most certainly will.

Well, it's just--

444
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:52,408
I just wanted to let you know

445
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:53,909
that I tried your
"kids' point of view" idea,

446
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,244

Well, it was great
hearing from you.

449
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:01,583
It's just I know,
now that you're presenting,

450
00:25:01,617 --> 00:25:03,251
you're prone to more
serious thought,

451
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,189
and I just wanted you
to know that one's a loser.

452
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:08,025
I'm always working, Peggy.
So are you.

453
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,496
Why are you undermining me?

454
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:14,469
From now on
I won't express myself.

455
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:16,737
Well, now it's tainted.

456
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:19,537
It's poisoned, because you
expressed yourself.

457
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:22,109
If you don't want to
do it, don't do it.

458

Did you lose your appetite?

459
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,825
Absolutely not.

Oh, hello.

461
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,608
Did you just get back?

462
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,579
No, but you did.

463
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:55,478
Is Tammy still up?

464
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:59,117
No. We said
our good nights.

Well, did you have a nice time?

I was in fine spirits

00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,597

about you pulled over

469

- Charlie Fiddich?
- Well, who was it, then?

471
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,640
Or are you going to keep
it a secret from me

472
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,777
like your father's
heart attack?

473
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:24,411
You've seen your
daughter for the year.

474
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:25,779
Don't you have
a plane to catch?

475
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:28,484
I don't like you carrying on like this.
It's immoral.

- You have a child.
- What?!

00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:20,945
That'd be nice.

527
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,523
( TV playing )

528
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:46,430
Air-conditioning.

529
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:48,700
Delicious.

530
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:51,503
- Did you have fun?
- You ate already?

531
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:53,672
I'm sorry, I was hungry.

532
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,038
I can eat again.

533
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,742
Look at these feet.

534
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,077
I wore my sandals
and I look like a hobo.

535
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:02,046
My toenails are black.

536
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,981
You can't wear
those in the city.

537
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,716
You might as well be barefoot.

538
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,085
Will you try on your wares?
Slowly?

539
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,155
Well, at least
you're in a better mood.

540
00:30:10,189 --> 00:30:12,760
Come over here.

541
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,035
Did you get your work done?

542
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,203
Some of it.

543
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,676
Well, this is my vacation,

544
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,445
and I knew you were
going to the office,

545
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,846
but the first Saturday
we spent here,

546
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,145
you needed to see
your daughter.

547
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:34,180
Then you didn't come home,

548
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:37,018
which I understand
was Trudy's fault.

549
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:40,018
Then you were grumpy.
Okay.

550
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:42,387
Then I amused myself
all morning,

551
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,389
and when I come back,
you ordered room service?

552
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,756
I'm inundated, sweetheart.

553
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,624
I don't like you in New York.

554
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,794
Well, then you don't like me.

555
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,862
You're not going to
fuck your way out of this.

556
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,196
What?

557
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:57,601
I'm going to wash my feet.

558
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:08,311
How's it going?

559
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:09,978
( huffs )

560
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,420
Did you park your
white horse outside?

561
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:23,992
Spare me the suspense and tell me
what your "save the day" plan is.

562
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:25,858
I don't have anything yet.

563
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,460
The idea I had wasn't great.

564
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,196
It wasn't great.
It was terrible.

565
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,797
I want to hear the real one.

566
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,498
Or are you just going to pull
it out during the presentation?

567
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:35,602
This idea is good.

568
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:37,171
I think we can get
the client to buy it.

569
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:40,172
No, you don't, or you
wouldn't have questioned it.

570
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:43,641
I'm going to do
whatever you say.

571
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,545
So you're going to pitch the
hell out of my shitty idea,

572
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,079
and I'm going to fail.

573
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,913
Peggy, I'm here to help you do

574
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:51,313
whatever you want to do.

575
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:54,085
Well, how am I
supposed to know?

576
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:58,588
That's a tough one.

577
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:01,525
- You love this.
- Not really.

578
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:04,627
I want you to feel good
about what you're doing,

579
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,765
but you'll never<i> know.</i>
That's just the job.

580
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,533
What's the job?

581
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:12,368
Living in
the "not knowing."

582
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:16,007
You know, I wouldn't have
argued if it was me.

583
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,612
I would have just given
you a hundred ideas

584
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,382
and never questioned why.

585
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,084
You really want to help me?

586
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,319
Show me how you think.

587
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:27,224
Do it out loud.

588
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,294
You can't tell people
what they want.

589
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:31,195
It has to be what<i> you</i> want.

590
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:35,796
I want to go to the movies.

591
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,404
I just came back from
"I Am Curious Yellow."

592
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,507
I'm still scandalized.

593
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:48,309
Of course Megan would want
to see a dirty movie.

594
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:51,376
- Do you want to work?
- It doesn't matter if I want to.

595
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,544
I have to, because
all of this is crap.

596
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:57,847
Pros and cons.

597
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:00,216
Pros--
it's almost done and it's good.

598
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,219
The account man's overjoyed
and the client's on board.

599
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:06,323
Those are the cons,
and you know it.

600
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:10,462
Well...

601
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:16,403
whenever I'm really
unsure about an idea,

602
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,904
first...

603
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,444
I abuse the people
whose help I need.

604
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,048
And then I take a nap.

605
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:29,788
Done.

606
00:33:29,822 --> 00:33:33,828
Then I start
at the beginning again...

607
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:38,265
and see if I end up
in the same place.

608
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,973
Mom's job is to make dinner.

609
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:46,509
Burger Chef's job
is to stop her.

610
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:54,048
What is it about that thing?
Little boys love it.

611
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,617
<i>( "The End of a Party"</i>
<i>plays in background )</i>

612
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:03,393
You're a very lucky person.

613
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:05,328
Have I been
complaining too much?

614
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:07,330
No.

615
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:10,000
- Did Gail go to bed?
- She did.

616
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,944
( sighs ) I know I
shouldn't be saying this,

617
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,681
because my heart is pounding.

618
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:24,184
What?

619
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:27,354
I know I said I didn't
get you anything...

620
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:31,661
but I did.

621
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:37,664
Bob, put that away.

622
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:40,266
I know I should have done
this a long time ago.

623
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,869
Did I miss my chance?

624
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:46,903
No.

625
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:50,205
I don't know.

626
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,341
So you don't feel
anything for me?

627
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,275
My face doesn't please you?

628
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:56,742
I don't believe it.

629
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,121
You don't want this.

630
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:11,923
You're not listening to me.

631
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:14,692
Bob...

632
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,362
you shouldn't be with a woman.

633
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:25,571
I have been, you know.

634
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:29,008
Why are you doing this now?

635
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:34,214
Well, honestly,

636
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:36,080
I'm moving on to Buick.

637
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:40,255
And GM expects a certain
kind of executive.

638
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:43,759
- You're leaving the agency?
- Yes.

639
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:45,894
But that's why
it would work so well.

640
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:49,500
You could stay here,
do whatever you want.

641
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,435
Kevin would have a father.

642
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:53,203
Or you could come with me.

643
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,906
You'd love Detroit.

644
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,742
We could have a mansion.

645
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:59,710
- When did all this happen?
- I just heard it.

646
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:02,413
And you can't relay it,

647
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:04,814
because they're moving
the XP to Campbell-Ewald.

648
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,782
- We lost Chevy?
- Yes.

649
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,350
But the audition was a success.

650
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:13,685
There's something else
coming down the road.

651
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,919
The times
like this, Joan--

652
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,787
this is when you need someone.

653
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:22,923
We could comfort each other
through an uncertain world.

654
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:26,990
I can't think
about this right now.

655
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,595
I'm thinking about you, Joan.

656
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:33,697
Is this what you want?

657
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:36,267
To be near 40 in a
two-bedroom apartment

658
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,536
with a mother and a little boy?

659
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:42,073
I know I am flawed,

660
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:46,044
but I am offering you more
than anyone else ever will.

661
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,454
No, you're not, Bob.

662
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,792
Because I want love.

663
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:59,331
And I'd rather die
hoping that happens

664
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:01,736
than make some arrangement.

665
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:07,142
And you should too.

666
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:11,981
I'm just being realistic.

667
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,385
Good night.

668
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,733
<i>( "Forever and Ever"</i>
<i>plays in background )</i>

669
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:46,971
Okay, so in this new version,
<i>Dad's</i> driving the car.

670
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:51,143
Mom's next to him, admiring?

671
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,741
How about a convertible?

672
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:57,311
Little boy and little girl
in the back,

673
00:37:57,346 --> 00:38:00,712
Dad's got a pipe in his mouth.
( chuckles )

674
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,816
Jesus, it's going to look
like 1955.

675
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,051
1955 was a good year.

676
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:08,249
I don't remember.

677
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:10,419
1965 was a good year.

678
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,258
I got married.

679
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,759
Moms love Burger Chef

680
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,732
because it's an answer
to a crisis.

681
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:22,005
What if Mom's
coming home from work?

682
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:24,472
What's her profession?

683
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:27,278
You are surrounded

684
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,582
by all kinds of mothers
who work, Don.

685
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,359
It's too sad for an ad.

686
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:36,961
( sighs )

687
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,062
Fine.

688
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:40,862
She burned the roast,

689
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,534
she dented the fender...

690
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:47,005
Keep going.

691
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:50,508
She backed over the dog,

692
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,244
little Katie's pregnant,
Jimmy got drafted,

693
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:55,313
but there is still a burger
and fries on that table?

694
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:59,918
Does this family exist anymore?

695
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:02,685
Are there people who eat dinner

696
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,991
and smile at each other
instead of watching TV?

697
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,698
Did you ever do that
with your family?

698
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:15,969
I don't remember.

699
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:22,245
What the hell do I know
about being a mom?

700
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,044
I just turned 30, Don.

701
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,582
Shit. When?

702
00:39:28,652 --> 00:39:30,786
A couple of weeks ago.

703
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,154
It doesn't matter.

704
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:36,490
I kept it as secret as I could.

705
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,728
Now I'm one of those women
lying about her age.

706
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:41,565
I hate them.

707
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:47,604
I worry about a lot of things,

708
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,709
but I don't worry about you.

709
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:56,185
What do you have
to worry about?

710
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:04,362
That I never did anything,

711
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:07,167
and that I don't have anyone.

712
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:16,208
I was in Ohio,

713
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:19,244
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

714
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:24,312
I looked in the window
of so many station wagons.

715
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:30,954
What did I do wrong?

716
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:43,762
You're doing great.

717
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:55,581
What if there was a place

718
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:58,248
where you could go...

719
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,318
where there was no TV...

720
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:04,290
and you could break bread...

721
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,595
and whoever you were
sitting with

722
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:09,531
was family?

723
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,069
<i>( "My Way"</i>
<i>playing in background )</i>

724
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:22,346
That's it.

725
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,017
That's more what it is.

It's official.
The XP is no longer ours.

753
00:43:17,073 --> 00:43:18,672
But they've thought of a name.

754
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:21,812
They're going to call it
"Roger Sterling's failure."

755
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:24,414
- I thought<i> you</i> signed them.
- Where did you hear this?

756
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:28,050
You knew?

757
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:29,752
Cutler: <i>I think we should
get ahead of this.</i>

758
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:31,853
I am proposing a "New
York Times" article

759
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:34,586
and the "Journal," too, announcing
that we're open for business

760
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,424
with our IBM 360 and our
proprietary software.

761
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,328
And there's a big
picture of Harry Crane,

762
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:43,361
- our newest partner.
- What?

763
00:43:43,396 --> 00:43:45,930
The rest of it's fine,
but Harry Crane's a partner?

764
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:47,863
If that's what it takes.

765
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:49,831
I'm not going limping
into Burger Chef.

766
00:43:49,865 --> 00:43:51,600
Why does he
have to be a<i> partner?</i>

767
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,968
Say what you will,
but he's very loyal.

768
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:58,033
All in favor?

769
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,240
Opposed?

770
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:10,012
The motion carries.
With two abstentions.

771
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,582
All right,
everybody back to work.

772
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,721
I've got it.

773
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:22,996
- What the hell do you want?
- Not Harry Crane as partner.

774
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:24,866
Well, you knew about Chevy,
and you didn't tell me.

775
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,201
- I could have done something.
- There was nothing to do.

776
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:28,668
Spill the beans or get out.

777
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,773
Bob Benson told me.

778
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:34,879
- He's going to Buick.
- Bob Benson?

779
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:38,583
- Please don't get him in trouble.
- You're kidding?

780
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:41,618
- I knew McCann was up to something.
- What are you talking about?

781
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:43,319
They're afraid we're
going to steal Buick.

782
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:44,619
What?

783
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:48,159
Just forget it.
Thank you.

784
00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:58,537
Now we have nothing.
We're only weeks away.

785
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,539
Just hear her out.

786
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:02,740
She'll have you done
in time for dinner.

787
00:45:04,377 --> 00:45:06,913
My plans got cancelled.

788
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:16,057
Look around.

789
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,626
I want to shoot the ad in here.

790
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:23,398
- It's not a home.
- It's better.

791
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:25,702
It's a clean,
well-lighted place.

792
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:28,237
Okay, Hemingway.

793
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,203
As long as it's
still about moms.

794
00:45:30,238 --> 00:45:32,641
It's about family.

795
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:35,113
Every table here
is the family table.

796
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:37,215
I hate
even the word "family."

797
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,115
It's vague.

798
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:41,518
"Mom" is more specific.
Tell her, Don.

799
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:44,591
She's doing it the way
she wants to do it.

800
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:47,393
You want it right or not?
