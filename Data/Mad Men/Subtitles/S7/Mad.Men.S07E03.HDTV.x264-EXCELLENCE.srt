2
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:02,925
<i>You killed him.</i>

3
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:04,297
You killed the ad.

4
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:05,951
<i>You killed everything.</i>

5
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:08,729
<i>She's the kind of girl</i>
who's gonna shine for the network

6
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,769
in her callback for the
"Bracken's World" pilot.

7
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:11,887
What?

8
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:12,985
Don and I signed Chevy.

9
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:13,819
Don who?

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,157
Our collective ex-wife
who still receives alimony?

11
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,588
I agree with Jim.

12
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:19,724
Do you still love Megan?

13
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,018
Of course I do.

14
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,397
Why don't you just tell her that
you don't want to move to California?

15
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:26,078
I will continue to answer your phone
and keep you up to date.

16
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,023
That's all I ask for.

24
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:10,740
- Dawn Chambers.
- I'm glad I caught you.

25
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,811
I need ribbon
for my typewriter.

26
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:14,615
It's a Coronet.

27
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:18,520
And I have letterhead, but I
could use a ream of onionskin.

28
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,828
- Okay. - And I wrote a letter
to Fritz over at Leica.

29
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:24,364
I'm going to need
an airmail envelope.

30
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,735
I can get these
sent over to you right now.

31
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,275
- Just bring them with you.
- Mr. Draper, I'm swamped.

32
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,112
<i>I have to get a schedule out</i>
<i>for a shoot.</i>

33
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:34,451
So you can come a little later.
What are you shooting?

34
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,724
- Mountain Dew.
- Oh.

35
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,393
What is it?

36
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:42,233
Um, it's called
"Invisible Boy."

37
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:43,669
It's this kid--

38
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,275
Ginsberg finally
got that through.

39
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,143
I guess so.

40
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:51,253
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can get a
messenger to you in 20 minutes,

41
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:52,789
unless you're going out.

42
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,961
Obviously I didn't
make any plans.

43
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,697
I was expecting you
to come over.

44
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,667
Were there any calls?

45
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:01,240
- <i> ( phone ringing )</i>
- Just Mr. Alan Silver

46
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:03,344
<i>from the Paul Kohner Agency</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

47
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,613
Can you get him on the line?

48
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,118
I'm sorry, my phone
is ringing off the hook.

49
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:11,353
I hope it's okay.
He says you have his number.

50
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:12,922
Or I can give it to you again.

51
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:15,093
No, Dawn, I want you
to call him.

52
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,297
I, uh--
can you hold?

53
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,319
Don Draper for Alan Silver.

54
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,088
Don.
Glad I caught you.

55
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,925
I was beginning
to give up hope.

56
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,761
How can I help you?

57
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,001
<i>It's a bit of a casting issue.</i>

58
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,769
I don't know if I
can help you with that.

59
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:50,473
Well, it has to do
with our girl.

60
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:53,176
And I'm probably overreacting,

61
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,980
but you're the closest thing
to a manager

62
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:58,850
and, let's face it, you
probably have more influence.

63
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:00,417
( laughs )
You better.

64
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,853
Just get to it, Alan.

65
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:05,521
Megan went into an audition

66
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:10,091
and performed adequately
from what I can tell

67
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,159
and by the time she got
to the parking lot

68
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,893
decided to call casting

69
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,425
and ask if she could come back
in and do it differently.

70
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,026
So she's persistent.

71
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,297
On Sunday she got
the director's number

72
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,064
from someone in her
acting class,

73
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,966
called his home,

74
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:29,505
then managed to run into him
at the Brentwood Country Mart

75
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,206
while he was having lunch
with Rod Serling.

76
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,241
She met Rod Serling?

77
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,711
I don't even know
if she knew he was there.

78
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,213
She apparently pled
her case in tears

79
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,217
and demanded another reading.

80
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,820
Why would she do that?

81
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,822
It's not like I've never
seen this before.

82
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,153
They lose their confidence.

83
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,152
But I don't want anyone
to have that anecdote.

84
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,222
It's best we nip this
in the bud.

85
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:56,291
Well, what am I supposed to do?

86
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,226
You know her better than I do.

87
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,593
I tried to talk to her,
but she hung up.

88
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,964
<i>You have to tell her to relax.</i>

89
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,502
<i>She really is doing well</i>
<i>as the new girl in town.</i>

90
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,071
- Yeah.
- Well, then,

91
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,941
I don't want to take up
any more of your precious time.

92
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,343
<i>Yeah, thank you.</i>

93
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,816
<i>( typewriters clicking )</i>

94
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,889
It's the Clios.
Who cares?

95
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,258
I do. But you shouldn't
give them the power

96
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,428
to decide who shall live
and who shall die.

97
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:37,463
Stan and I are part
of the agency

98
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,163
and Playtex is our client.

99
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,500
We'd feel the same if it
was the other way around.

100
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,970
Would you describe that
as patronizing?

101
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,506
I'm not taking anything
away from anybody.

102
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,112
But I'm not going to do better
work than St. Joseph's.

103
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:51,915
Lou's finishing his call.

104
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:55,683
You'll get 'em next year.

105
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:58,689
I gave that account
to you when I left.

106
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,457
I worked Playtex for years.

107
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:03,457
Well, maybe you
didn't work it right.

108
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,861
Lou:
<i>Send in the cavalry.</i>

109
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,645
Mr. Draper.
Good morning.

110
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,478
A weekday?
What a treat.

111
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,813
Nice to see you, Tricia.

112
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,616
No briefcase?

113
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,484
I'm going to surprise my wife.

114
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,992
I've said it before,
I hate her.

115
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,794
What can I get you?

116
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,594
Tomato juice.

117
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,534
Freeze-frame as our stallion
runs through the background.

118
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,102
The bottle appears.

119
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,637
Announcer--
"Chevalier Noir.

120
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,206
More horsepower."

121
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,341
Why is there artwork?

122
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,207
Well, I believe it really
helps if you see it.

123
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:55,208
You understand every hour
he works costs money?

124
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:56,675
You can't be hypothetical.

125
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,975
- It took a second, Lou.
- Stay out of it, Rizzo.

126
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,308
It's already done.
Would you just look at it?

127
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,444
Who put a knot
in your pantyhose?

128
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:07,448
She's upset because
I got nominated for a Clio

129
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,883
and "Rosemary's Baby" didn't.

130
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,885
I don't care about awards.

131
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,052
Oh, sorry, Peggy.

132
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,989
Jim pulled it because
St. Joseph's

133
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:20,230
was still unhappy
about going over budget

134
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:23,232
and all the awards
Ted's already won for them.

135
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,067
They're upset about winning?

136
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,171
You know clients hate awards.

137
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,108
That's why Ogilvy
never submits.

138
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:31,608
He does it for the clients.
Trust me.

139
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:34,909
Wasn't Ogilvy the chairman
of the Clios last year?

140
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:37,681
That's comforting--
you weren't rejected.

141
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,283
You weren't even considered.

142
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,852
- Are we finished?
- Sorry about that.

143
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,755
- You want to go to color?
- Ask your boss.

144
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,298
I'm usually by his side.

145
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,866
The real challenge in our life

146
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,570
has been trying to get
Rocky's attention.

147
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,274
Rocky.

148
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:03,379
I told you last time to tell
him that I'm an admirer.

149
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,082
( chuckles )

150
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,617
After Henry patched things up,

151
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,886
he'd hoped to be on
the short list for AG.

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,155
Attorney General.

153
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,959
But I shouldn't be
talking about this.

154
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,595
How are things in real estate?

155
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,398
I'm a travel agent, Betty.

156
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:20,566
But you're still going to take
that exam again, aren't you?

157
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,403
No, it's going swimmingly.

158
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,372
I'm in the office
three days a week now.

159
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,781
"Wanderlust Travel."

160
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,081
That's spicy.

161
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:34,982
Take a few.
I'm sure you'll need them.

162
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,985
Henry's secretary
takes care of all that.

163
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,922
But she still has to
book through somebody.

164
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,624
Trust me, it's not all about breaking
the rack rate on the hotel room.

165
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,758
It's about perfection.

166
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,525
One of my clients
told me that I redefined

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,863
his definition of first class.

168
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,101
Three days a week in an office.

169
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,902
What's that like?

170
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:58,307
It's a little shopping
center in Dobbs Ferry.

171
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,610
Just a storefront, really.
Bunch of desks.

172
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,444
Everybody's on the phone
all the time,

173
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,579
so you have to keep
one finger in your ear.

174
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,647
I have three phones
and no secretary.

175
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:09,017
Sometimes I can't turn
my neck when I get home.

176
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,383
Doesn't Carlton complain?

177
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,850
He likes the money.

178
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,886
He wants me to let the girl
go, and I probably should.

179
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,721
Ernie and Jenny
are walking to school now.

180
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,194
Well, Gene's a few years
away from that.

181
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,863
Oh, your time's occupied.

182
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,731
But for the rest of us,

183
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,268
as they get older,
there's less and less to do.

184
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,939
Being alone in the house
all that time.

185
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:31,506
I really needed a challenge.

186
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,844
Well, there's still plenty of
challenges ahead, believe me.

187
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,020
Fine, I needed a reward.

188
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:41,253
I thought they were the reward.

189
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't know.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned.

190
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,129
Betty Draper, that is indeed
how I would describe you.

191
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,768
I want that streusel coffee cake.
Will you split?

192
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,805
Of course.

193
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:03,779
Well, hello.
How you doing, Tom?

194
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:06,414
- Randall.
- Good.

195
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,150
Our good friends at Koss here,

196
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:09,886
and frankly
I'll include myself,

197
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,254
have a few questions for you.

198
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,254
Love to explain anything.

199
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:16,054
I think it's the media
plan we agreed upon.

200
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,756
No.

201
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,260
It's about this article
from a few weeks back.

202
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:23,794
Yes, I've seen this, obviously.

203
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,795
I'm very happy
with our media plan,

204
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,429
but Grey has this computer that
they're opening up to everybody.

205
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:32,064
We just thought maybe
we should look into it.

206
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,900
Or you should.

207
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,137
Look, may I sit down?

208
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,937
This is a very enviable
piece of PR.

209
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,039
Grey gets "The New York Times"
to tell all about their computer

210
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:46,841
by offering their services
up to the world.

211
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,080
But I swear, as clever
as it is, it's just PR.

212
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,213
I'm an engineer.

213
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,616
You can explain to me
what the difference is

214
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,452
between their computer
and your computer.

215
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,590
Well, computers don't think.
People do.

216
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,191
And the data accumulated
by me and my department

217
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,526
reflects the same national
availability of media.

218
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,564
What we will be able
to offer soon

219
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:09,033
is local data as well.

220
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,170
We will be able to integrate local and
national markets into one report.

221
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,639
We are developing that program.

222
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,306
There you have it.

223
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,106
You'll forgive me,

224
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,774
but Grey's does sound
very impressive.

225
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,778
They're a different
kind of agency.

226
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:25,251
I wasn't even invited to this meeting
because this is about your business.

227
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,619
Koss, that's the only name
that should be in the paper.

228
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,153
Very well put.

229
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,655
Tom, does that put you at ease?

230
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,931
I'm really sorry
to put you through that.

231
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:39,602
Randy warned me, but,
you know, I got to ask.

232
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,136
( laughs )

233
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,871
I'll walk you out.

234
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:45,007
You said you wanted to poke your
head in and say hi to Peggy?

235
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,213
It's good to see you. Got to
get you out on that boat.

236
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,649
Thank you, Jim.
Harry, always a pleasure.

237
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,795
What are you smiling about?

238
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,794
Did you not call for a fireman?

239
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:03,895
Why the hell is Grey Advertising
coming up in my meeting?

240
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,830
Well, that article
could have been about us

241
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:08,198
if anyone appreciated
our media department.

242
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:11,204
Are you aware your
self-pity is distasteful?

243
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,875
You know what? This
conversation is over.

244
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,079
I'm really not interested.

245
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,724
<i>( car approaches )</i>

246
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,965

247
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,779
Hello.

248
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:47,081
You're here!
You surprised me!

249
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,258
Maybe I got your hints.

250
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,193
I've never, ever admitted
that I've wanted this.

251
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:00,463
What happened?
Did you get fired?

252
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,336
I just had a hankering.

253
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,903
Oh, really?

254
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:10,775
Well, an extra special
hankering you shall get.

255
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,989
<i>( TV playing )</i>

256
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,059
Hello.

257
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,193
Loretta, please.

258
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:26,560
They're not watching.

259
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,829
No, I believe they're not
interested in that.

260
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,763
Aren't you helping
Bobby with his homework?

261
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:36,165
Yes, ma'am. You got to sign this
slip for Bobby's field trip.

262
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,100
How was everyone today?

263
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:42,269
They're little angels.

264
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,442
They're looking for chaperones.
I can take Genie along.

265
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:50,179
Well, if you can remember to turn
this in, I want to go along.

266
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,280
You do?
You're gonna come?

267
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,647
Yes.
Yes, I am.

268
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,682
Great. It's Miss
Keyser's dad's farm.

269
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:59,486
She grew up there and they
make butter and grow eggs.

270
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,423
Well, we'll see all that,
won't we?

271
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,093
I'm going to change.

272
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,765
I really needed that.

273
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,869
I really needed this.

274
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,007
So I could have been anyone.

275
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,544
It's your own fault.

276
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:22,781
I think I've been
alone too much.

277
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,118
You have so many friends,
I can't keep track.

278
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,455
I don't know.

279
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,158
( sighs )

280
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:33,295
It's sunny here
for everyone but me.

281
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,564
I'm walking around
in a cloud of "no."

282
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,371
Megan, you know,

283
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,808
they're getting rejected, too.

284
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:47,881
Maybe they're just
handling it better.

285
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,984
That's a terrible thing to say.

286
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:53,957
I'm speaking from experience.

287
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,562
You can't let it
erode your confidence.

288
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,134
And you can't get
angry or desperate.

289
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,404
I know that.

290
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,508
I know all that.

291
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,677
What the hell
are you doing here?

292
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,017
Alan called me.

293
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:16,258
What?
He called you?

294
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:20,695
I'm your husband.
He was worried.

295
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:23,064
Great, now I have to fire him.

296
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,765
What am I gonna do? How am
I gonna find someone new?

297
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,404
You don't have to fire anyone. You just
have to stop acting like a lunatic.

298
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:32,972
What did he say?
You know what? Forget it.

299
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:36,842
So you came out here to what?

300
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,745
Pull me out of a bathtub
where I slit my wrists?

301
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,312
I'll admit it, I was worried.

302
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,546
Well, thanks
for the visit, Daddy.

303
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,682
I was stupid for thinking
you could possibly miss me.

304
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:48,581
I do miss you.

305
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,251
No, you don't.

306
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,654
I should fly in
and surprise<i> you.</i>

307
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:58,721
Yeah, that's a scary
thought, isn't it?

308
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:00,656
- No.
- Really?

309
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,259
You're never there when I call

310
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,696
and you always
have to call me back.

311
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,964
And it's always quiet.

312
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,464
Where is it quiet
in that office?

313
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,398
And I've never even
heard a typewriter.

314
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,233
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is true.

315
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:16,134
I'm sorry I had to
interrupt your love affairs

316
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:17,702
with the disaster of my career.

317
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,237
Megan, sit down.

318
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,705
I was your secretary, remember?

319
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,639
I know what you're like
when you're left alone.

320
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,512
- You're acting crazy.
- So where are you?

321
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,313
Why can't I reach you?
Who's your new girl, Don?

322
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:32,018
There is no one else.

323
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,389
I've been at home.

324
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,796
They put me on leave, okay?

325
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,600
You lost your job?

326
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,337
Don't worry,
I'm still getting paid.

327
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,509
I don't give a shit.
When did this happen?

328
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,209
Right after you left.

329
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,177
They fired you last year?

330
00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:59,812
I didn't get fired.
That's the thing.

331
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:03,249
I don't know if they want
me or they don't want me.

332
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,650
Why didn't you tell me?

333
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:07,519
Because I messed up

334
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,256
and I didn't want you
to know until I fixed it.

335
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,423
And there is no one else.
I've been good.

336
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,023
I haven't even been
drinking that much.

337
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,230
So with a clear head,

338
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:22,762
you got up every day
and decided

339
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:25,232
that you didn't
want to be with me?

340
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:31,573
Megan.

341
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,175
( sighs )

342
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:41,118
Mm, I'm not walking
out of my own house.

343
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,485
So that means
you have to leave.

344
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,823
Have you calmed down?

345
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:52,492
I'm not kidding around.

346
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:55,964
I want you to call a cab,
get on a plane, go home.

347
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:03,002
I don't want you to worry
about me anymore.

348
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,637
Stop it.

349
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:07,106
It's okay, Don.

350
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,007
This is the way it ends.

351
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:13,311
It's going to be so much
easier for both of us.

352
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:35,399
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i> I have Mr. Grady calling.</i>

353
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,200
<i>He's from</i>
<i>"The Wall Street Journal."</i>

354
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,401
Really?
Put him through.

355
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,742
Harold Crane here.

356
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:48,545
We have a situation.

357
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,315
I know this isn't the message,

358
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,789
but we can all learn something
from the funeral business.

359
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,625
Did you tell "The Wall Street
Journal" to give me a call?

360
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,360
( sighs )
I felt badly about

361
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:01,826
diminishing your contributions
in this morning's meeting.

362
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,496
And let's face it, this computer
situation is an arms race.

363
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,064
There's no point in winning
if people don't know.

364
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,364
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

365
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,831
What?

366
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,632
Believe me, I ask for one
every Christmas

367
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,298
and no one even bothers
to say no.

368
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,135
Well, why did you tell
the client we do?

369
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:18,867
It's semantics.

370
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:21,466
We use a computer, therefore
I call it <i>our</i> computer.

371
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,602
But it's actually
someone else's computer.

372
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:26,769
And the local markets program?

373
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:29,571
It's a great idea. I'm sure
someone's going to do that.

374
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:35,345
You have stiff competition,
but I believe you to be

375
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:38,549
the most dishonest man
I have ever worked with.

376
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,180
I didn't call
"The Wall Street Journal."

377
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,249
Kill it.

378
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,351
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

379
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,118
Woman:
<i>Dave Wooster's office.</i>

380
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,620
Is Dave in?
It's Clarence Birdseye calling.

381
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:52,556
<i>Just a minute.</i>
<i>Let me see if he's available.</i>

382
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,694
Dave:
<i>Well, hello, Don.</i>

383
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,630
Enough dancing around.
Let's have dinner.

384
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,467
<i>How's tonight?</i>

385
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,939
7:30.
The Algonquin.

386
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:12,819
( exhales )

387
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,322
Well, while we're digesting,

388
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,125
perhaps you should do
a little digesting.

389
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,339
You can look at it now or you
can put it in your pocket,

390
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,008
but you can't use it
as a coaster.

391
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,480
Why don't you just
tell me what's in it?

392
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,483
Why don't you look?

393
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:37,621
- That's coy.
- No, that's drama.

394
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,491
Woman:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

395
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,695
I'm sure you caught
my eye during dinner.

396
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,466
I was only staring because I
believe we know each other.

397
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,239
Emily Arnett?

398
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,315
I'm afraid I can't place you.

399
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to interrupt anything.

400
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:02,657
Would you like to join us?

401
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:06,060
No, I'm off to bed.

402
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:08,460
Hopefully I'll be able
to sleep.

403
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:11,227
I'm on the top floor
right next to the elevator.

404
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,031
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

405
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,033
Have a good night.

406
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,703
Who was she?

407
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,872
Fellas, there's no need
for the hard sell.

408
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:26,275
We had nothing to do with that.

409
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,711
I wish I'd thought of it.

410
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,249
Should we get another drink or
do you have someplace to be?

411
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:39,923
( chuckles )

412
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,069
( knocks )

413
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,339
Hello.

414
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:52,874
What are you doing here?

415
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,076
Are you alone?

416
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,378
For the time being.

417
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,288
I came by because I had
a quick question.

418
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,290
- Shoot.
- How do you sleep at night?

419
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,159
You know what?
I called you at Christmas.

420
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,532
I'm sorry I opened the door.
I was expecting a BLT.

421
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,635
Why would I want to talk
to you when you fired me?

422
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,136
I got the message.
"Merry Christmas, love, Judas."

423
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,773
What is this?

424
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,740
That's a nice offer.

425
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,908
They're really trying to make it
sound like it's not a demotion.

426
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,110
So I take the job?
That's your advice?

427
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:29,311
If that's what you want to do.

428
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,279
Well, I know what you want me to do.
Go away.

429
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:32,813
I guess you don't remember

430
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:35,082
I started that company.
I had to talk you into it.

431
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:37,987
I guess you forgot I found you
at the bottom of a fur box.

432
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,720
I would never have
done that to you.

433
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:42,386
Oh, come on. Don't be
a big baby about it.

434
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,822
You were a disaster.
We did you a favor.

435
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,591
<i>The man who talked to Hershey?</i>

436
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,158
I've seen that man wandering the
streets with a sandwich board

437
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,727
saying
"The end is near."

438
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:53,063
- So I have my answer.
- I didn't know the question?

439
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:54,528
You want to come back?
Come back.

440
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,099
I miss you.

441
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,401
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

442
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:01,904
- Who is it?
Sherry:<i> - Room service.</i>

443
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,611
Oh.

444
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,614
I didn't know we had company.

445
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:12,549
Yeah, for once,
it's a friend of<i> mine.</i>

446
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:15,919
Sherry, this is Don.

447
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,957
I was just leaving.

448
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:24,096
Come in Monday.

449
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,794
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

450
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,769
Megan:<i> - Hello.</i>
- It's me.

451
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:02,977
Hello.

452
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,645
I wanted to hear your voice.

453
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,312
I don't have a lot to say.

454
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,946
Then you can just listen.

455
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,913
I...

456
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:21,750
I shouldn't have lied to you.

457
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,952
And I'm sorry.

458
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:27,022
And I want everything
to be okay.

459
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,323
( sighs )

460
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:32,725
Are you there?

461
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:35,496
Yes.

462
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,430
I can see now that I wasn't...

463
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:41,863
thinking clearly

464
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,235
and I had this logic
to what I did and...

465
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:49,536
Hopefully now

466
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,106
things can be the way
we want them to be

467
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,707
because I'm going back
to the agency.

468
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:58,342
Good for you.

469
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,145
<i>I don't know if I can undo it,</i>
<i>but I think I fixed it.</i>

470
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:06,820
"I fixed it"
is you got a job out here.

471
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,690
That's what you promised me.
That's why I'm here.

472
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:12,428
I just thought that if you
found out what happened...

473
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,599
you wouldn't look at me
in the same way.

474
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:21,304
I can't believe
after all this time

475
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:23,039
you don't know me.

476
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:26,642
I know how I want you
to see me.

477
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:30,248
Don't lie to me.

478
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:32,550
Don't do that.

479
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,917
You can't do that.

480
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,154
I'm your wife.

481
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:41,259
Stop pushing me away
with both hands.

482
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,130
I could come back out.

483
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:50,000
I have the weekend.

484
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,338
( sighs )

485
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,441
Not now.

486
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,379
It's not a good idea.

487
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,746
I love you.

488
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,679
Good night.

489
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,370
There's basically
Frankenstein, Dracula,

490
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:39,274
Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

491
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,040
- That's quite a few.
- There's also King Kong, too,

492
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:43,675
but he's not really a monster.

493
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,645
I like all of them,

494
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,416
but I guess Wolf Man's
my favorite

495
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,749
because he changes into it.

496
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,950
Dracula changes into a bat.

497
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:54,685
That's true.

498
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:57,053
16, 18...

499
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:58,785
It's nice to see
somebody getting along.

500
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,253
We were having a conversation.

501
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:04,122
Thank you so much
for helping out.

502
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:05,924
( bus thumps )

503
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,530
Makes my job so much easier.

504
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,069
Bobby asked
and I couldn't say no.

505
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:15,440
My mom loves animals.

506
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,276
She really likes you.

507
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:23,846
Yes, well, that blouse
says she likes everyone.

508
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:42,061
It's Lou, right?

509
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:45,796
Oh, hello there.

510
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,297
Good to see you.

511
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,369
Sure.

512
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:52,838
How are you, Don?

513
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:55,938
Ready to get back to work.

514
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,507
Good for you.

515
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,785
Hello there.

516
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,786
Oh, Don.
Look at you.

517
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,622
- How are you?
- I'm good.

518
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:15,189
It's been too long.

519
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,523
Here I am.

520
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:19,191
Why don't you let me
take that up to him?

521
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,160
( laughs )
To Roger?

522
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,161
No, he's not in yet.
That's mine.

523
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,462
Do you want some?

524
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,662
When do you expect him?
I think we have a meeting.

525
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,796
I'm always the last to know.

526
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,303
It's fine.

527
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:37,872
I'll keep myself occupied.

528
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,773
Great to see you again.

529
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:49,886
Keep that.

530
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,259
- Is Jim Cutler in yet?
- I think he's at breakfast.

531
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,328
I don't care if he's in bed
with Joey Heatherton.

532
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:55,963
Get him on the horn.

533
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,004
Ginsberg:
<i>Don?</i>

534
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,308
Is that you?

535
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,077
Hello, Michael.

536
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,079
Ed, come here.
Look who's here.

537
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:15,415
Oh, hi, Don.
Great to see you.

538
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,715
Boy, you smell good.

539
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,520
Hey, you know what?
Are you busy?

540
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:21,391
- What do you mean?
- Don't bother him.

541
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:24,360
He'll know.
Come here.

542
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,797
Chevalier Blanc has
started Chevalier Noir.

543
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,698
That's "night,"
or "black."

544
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:30,465
Either way, it's the
opposite of Blanc.

545
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,967
And we're supposed
to work up print

546
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:35,501
based on this voiceover
tagline, "More horsepower."

547
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:38,400
And you gotta see the words, but
it ends with a freeze-frame.

548
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:40,002
What does?

549
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,438
The TV spot.

550
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,137
Oh. I assume
you have storyboards.

551
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:47,405
Exit stage left.

552
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,609
What have you been up to, Don?

553
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,981
Just R&R mostly.

554
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:58,317
Do you want to see
the strategy?

555
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:02,153
Sure.

556
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:09,288
What happened to the storyboards
from Chevalier Noir?

557
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:11,059
She gave them to Lou.

558
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,294
What do I do?
Don wants to see 'em.

559
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:16,130
- Don?
- Don-- Draper.

560
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:17,332
Says who?

561
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:19,199
Says him.
He's outside.

562
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:23,067
Right now?
What's he doing here?

563
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,235
You want I should ask him?

564
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,783
What's he doing?

565
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:37,319
Who cares?

566
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,521
What's going on?

567
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:42,256
Shh. Look.

568
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:45,994
What is he doing here?

569
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,363
Maybe he finished drying out.

570
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:50,832
Meredith, we better
get back to work.

571
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,270
Hello, Don.

572
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,772
Hello, Stan.

573
00:31:57,806 --> 00:31:59,541
Where you been?
Riding the rails?

574
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:02,043
- Turns out Lou's got the boards.
- It's fine.

575
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:04,046
Mr. Draper.

576
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,648
Morning, Dawn.

577
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:09,620
Seems to be some lapse
in communication

578
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:12,590
- regarding my return.
- No one told me.

579
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,961
Could you just let me know
when someone tracks down Mr. Sterling?

580
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:17,933
- Can I get some coffee?
- Certainly.

581
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,003
Why don't you fellas
catch me up?

582
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,873
You want me to get everything?

583
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,576
Whatever you got handy.

584
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,677
Let's start with the garbage.

585
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,596
Children, this is my
father, Farmer Cy.

586
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,999
You can call me Cyrus
or Cy or "Hey, mister."

587
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,464
( laughs )

588
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,768
If you look around,
you can see pigs

589
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,270
and goats and chickens.

590
00:32:49,304 --> 00:32:51,739
And Pammy's favorite,
the horsies.

591
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,808
We've got all the animals.

592
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:56,880
<i>But this farm is mostly</i>
<i>for growing potatoes.</i>

593
00:32:56,914 --> 00:32:58,715
So there's not a lot
above ground.

594
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,185
But I know you're all
here to see the cows.

595
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,054
So why don't we walk this way?

596
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,630
I'm sorry, ladies, but there's
no smoking in the barn.

597
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:09,731
I'll be along.

598
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:13,432
You're not afraid of
missing them milk the cow?

599
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,501
I'll be done in a minute.

600
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, I hope no one accidentally
grabs on the wrong udders.

601
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,375
Excuse me?

602
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:24,377
Farmer's daughter needs a bra.

603
00:33:24,412 --> 00:33:26,643
( laughs )

604
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:29,147
( clicking )

605
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,754
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you need my lighter?

606
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,454
Would you mind?

607
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:37,222
Don?
Is that you?

608
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:40,026
Boys, excuse me a minute.

609
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,398
Don, what a pleasant surprise.

610
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:44,667
You're looking well, Joan.

611
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,237
What have you been up to?
What are you doing here?

612
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:49,540
- Waiting.
- For what?

613
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,407
You two just getting in?

614
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:53,444
We had a breakfast meeting.

615
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:54,846
What are you doing here?

616
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:57,181
I guess I'm waiting for Roger.

617
00:33:57,216 --> 00:34:00,184
Oh, I see.

618
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:03,256
Well...

619
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,558
it was nice seeing you.

620
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:10,797
Guess what?
Cynthia had a little boy.

621
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,898
Edward, but we call him Eddie.

622
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:15,167
Eddie Cosgrove.

623
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:17,973
That's the carousel
in Central Park.

624
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,875
Always makes me think of you.

625
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,646
- Now I know what you'll look like bald.
- ( laughs )

626
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,618
( knocks )
May I have a word?

627
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:27,887
Don't linger in the door.

628
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,453
I'm wearing boots.

629
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:32,553
Yes, fine, dear.

630
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,755
Did you know that
Don Draper is downstairs?

631
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,125
Doing what?

632
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,466
He says he's waiting for Roger.
Does that ring a bell?

633
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,301
He shouldn't be here.

634
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:47,779
So obviously I would
like to get married,

635
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:50,148
but, you know, I don't
really have any savings.

636
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:52,786
I mean, it doesn't make any sense
to borrow money from my parents

637
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,359
just so I look successful
in front of hers, does it?

638
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:58,763
I don't know.
That is a tough spot.

639
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,496
What the hell
is going on in here?

640
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,297
We were just catching up.

641
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:05,799
That's nice, ladies.
You four, in my office.

642
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:10,337
- We have that meeting.
- What meeting?

643
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,138
Sorry, Don.

644
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,451
( cow moos )

645
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,091
Don't get no fresher than that.

646
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:33,492
Who wants to try it?

647
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,927
I will.

648
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:39,699
- Really?
- Sure.

649
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:42,036
See how warm it is?

650
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:49,576
It's sweet.

651
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,387
Don.

652
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,191
Where the hell were you?

653
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:06,096
- Had an early lunch.
- I can smell it.

654
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,598
I didn't know you
were gonna beat me here.

655
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,303
You could have told somebody.
Anybody.

656
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,672
I don't have to tell anybody. That's
my name on the door out there.

657
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:15,173
This is my agency. I'm the
president of this agency.

658
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,906
I don't have to ask
anybody anything.

659
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,838
You know what? I could call a holiday
for the whole office right now.

660
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:21,007
I've been sitting in here
waiting for you.

661
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,477
I'm not gonna slink out of here
with my tail between my legs.

662
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:26,278
- Now call a damn meeting.
- Let me ask Joan.

663
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:29,782
- Don't ask Joan.
- Wait here.

664
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,917
Chicken salad on rye
and a Nesbitt's?

665
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:40,285
Yes, thank you, Dawn.

666
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,129
<i>( children laughing )</i>

667
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:56,331
You eat. I'm going
to wash my hands.

668
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,032
Okay.

669
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,503
You can't sit there.
That's my mom's spot.

670
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:13,749
Jim:
<i>Don?</i>

671
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:15,884
Hello, Jim.

672
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,856
I'm surprised to see you.

673
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,393
Well, here I am.

674
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,932
Mr. Cutler.
There you are.

675
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,518
I can go down to the lobby
and sell newspapers,

676
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:37,987
but you're still gonna pay me.

677
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:40,255
- I have a two-year contract.
- Calm down.

678
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,623
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

679
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:45,861
What am I supposed to do? Just
hide while he sits down there

680
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,864
cooling his heels
like Longfellow Deeds?

681
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:51,266
We're going
to ask him to leave.

682
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,001
May I?

683
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,810
Be careful.
I've seen this before.

684
00:37:57,844 --> 00:37:59,376
You might want
to call security.

685
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,221
Lot of bees over there.

686
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:10,990
They live in drawers.

687
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:16,025
- Where's my sandwich?
- What do you mean?

688
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,428
There were two.

689
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,098
I traded it.

690
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,598
- You traded it?
- With Susie Rogers.

691
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,899
She didn't have a sandwich.

692
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,434
I got her gumdrops.

693
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,072
Bobby, that was my lunch.

694
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,042
I'm sorry.
I'll go get it back.

695
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,245
Stop it.
It's fine.

696
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,779
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

697
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:42,117
I'm sorry. I swear I didn't
know you were going to eat.

698
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,284
There were two sandwiches.

699
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:51,623
- You want them?
- No.

700
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:53,089
You eat them.

701
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,461
I don't want them.

702
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,997
Eat your candy.

703
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:25,453
Your shoes.

704
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:27,389
What about her?

705
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:29,492
I just discovered
you're our best hope

706
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,496
to explain why
Don Draper is downstairs.

707
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:35,736
He came to me in remorse

708
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,371
and said he's ready
to come back.

709
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:40,038
Ah, I see.

710
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:43,577
Well, unfortunately,
we fired him.

711
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,146
No, we didn't.

712
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:48,014
We deliberately put him on
leave in this very room.

713
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:50,551
We didn't fire him.
I would never agree to that.

714
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:52,788
The leave of absence
was a very clear message.

715
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:55,358
We were allowing him
to preserve his dignity

716
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,827
while seeking other employment.

717
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,363
Ah.

718
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,300
Well, I remember clearly
that Cutler said

719
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:04,066
the leave of absence was
to give him time to think.

720
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,436
I didn't want any more rancor.

721
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,272
Is that what you thought?
That we fired him?

722
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:10,841
Not necessarily,
but I did expect

723
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,310
to revisit the topic
after some time as a group.

724
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,047
Well, here we are.
Let's take a vote.

725
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,618
- I'll speak for Ted.
- And I'll speak for Pete.

726
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,723
All I can say is that Don
is a very talented man,

727
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,894
but how does he fit
into everything now?

728
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:28,329
This is working.

729
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:30,732
Besides, we're still mopping
up the damage he's done.

730
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,368
I do not like the way
this agency

731
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:35,236
is spoken of out there.

732
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:37,872
You don't think that's because our
creative is invisible right now?

733
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:39,638
One nomination.

734
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:41,703
Lou didn't put in anything
he couldn't tag his name on.

735
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,337
He barely worked here
last year.

736
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,006
Lou is adequate.

737
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,010
I think it's more important
we discuss Harry Crane.

738
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:49,711
Harry Crane?

739
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:52,013
He's gone.
Anything else?

740
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,448
This agency is too dependent
on creative personalities.

741
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:57,214
You're still talking for Ted?

742
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,383
If we want people
speaking about this agency,

743
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,821
what they should be speaking
about is our media department.

744
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:05,326
We need to invest
in a computer, period.

745
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,828
We need to tell our clients we're
thinking about the future,

746
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:09,663
not creative hijinks.

747
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:11,166
Don is a genius.

748
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,968
He's costing us a fortune.

749
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,872
- You hate him.
- I don't.

750
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,739
I hate what he did to Ted.

751
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,010
Enough! This is a
financial decision.

752
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,946
Obviously, it's not.

753
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:25,087
Right now Don draws
a sizable salary

754
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,722
and has a partnership stake.

755
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:28,457
That costs more
than a computer.

756
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:30,560
- He has a contract.
- He's in breach.

757
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,794
No, he's not.
He's on<i> leave.</i>

758
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:35,196
And even if we do fire him,
he's a partner.

759
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,298
We have to buy him out.

760
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,266
That's true.

761
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,667
That's a big hit.

762
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:44,199
As tough as it is,
I'm confident

763
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,902
it'll be more profitable
in the long term.

764
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,208
Since when are you allowed to use the
words "long term" in this office?

765
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,810
It'll be 1973
before we're even.

766
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,677
We fire him,
we lose the noncompete.

767
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,747
You want to walk down
some hotel hallway

768
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,717
and see Mary Wells sitting on Don's lap
the next time you go in to present?

769
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:07,455
( TV playing )

770
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,859
How was the farm?

771
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,060
How was your day?

772
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,161
Did you eat?

773
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:17,428
I'm not hungry.

774
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:20,064
I was hungry, but now I'm not.

775
00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:24,670
It was a long day.

776
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:27,236
I'm going to give Gene a bath.

777
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,536
Come on, Genie.

778
00:42:38,577 --> 00:42:41,109
What happened?

779
00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:45,249
I wish it was yesterday.

780
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:02,362
How was your day?

781
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:06,963
( chuckles )
That remains to be seen.

782
00:43:06,998 --> 00:43:09,100
Are you coming back?

783
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:11,703
I thought so.

784
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:15,004
Now I'm not so sure.

785
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:20,208
Well, I can't say
that we miss you.

786
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:23,981
Thank you, Peggy.

787
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,321
( TV playing )

788
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:38,797
What happened?

789
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:41,736
I couldn't get it out of Bobby.

790
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:45,373
It was a perfect day
and he ruined it.

791
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:48,043
How is that possible, Betty?

792
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,716
Do you think I'm a good mother?

793
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,282
Of course.

794
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:02,289
Then why don't they love me?

795
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,190
What are you talking about?

796
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:07,222
Look at him.

797
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:13,697
It's just a matter of time.

798
00:44:25,565 --> 00:44:26,965
Mr. Draper.

799
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:30,068
Yes. Dawn...

800
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:31,771
can I get some coffee?

801
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:34,576
Of course, but they want to see
you in the conference room--

802
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,810
the partners.

803
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:41,851
Oh.

804
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:11,681
Hello, everyone.

805
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,116
Come on, sit down.

806
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:21,020
- Bert, how are you?
- Capital.

807
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,887
Well, this is
the meeting I assumed

808
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,220
you were gonna have
before I came, Roger.

809
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,657
Sorry if I disrupted your day,

810
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,159
but I've had a productive time
catching myself up with everything.

811
00:45:31,193 --> 00:45:33,864
Well, we've discussed it
and we've reached the conclusion

812
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,898
that we'd like you
to come back to work.

813
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,238
I'm pleased to hear that.

814
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,776
But there are
some stipulations.

815
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:49,178
Violation of which
will result in termination

816
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:52,079
and a reabsorption
of your partnership shares.

817
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:57,184
You are not allowed
to be alone with clients.

818
00:45:57,218 --> 00:46:00,020
You are to stick
to the script in meetings

819
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:02,957
and that means the script
will be approved

820
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,128
by the people in this room.

821
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,029
Outside of client hospitality,

822
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,028
there will be no
drinking in the office.

823
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:13,369
You'll be in Lane's old office.

824
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,938
And you will report to Lou.

825
00:46:31,893 --> 00:46:33,458
Okay.
