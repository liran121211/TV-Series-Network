00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:05,334
I'm the new head of marketing at Avon.

4
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:07,456
I thought it was a date, but
it turned out to be better.

5
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:09,861
You'll be the accountman
if that's what you want.

6
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:11,412
I'm going to California.

7
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:13,139
I can't be around you.

8
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:14,619
Just get out!

9
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,004
Is this about the Hershey meeting?

10
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,710
We think it's best for you and the firm
if you take some time off and regroup.

11
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:23,632
I think you're putting me in a position
of saying "I don't care what you think".

12
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:26,535
How much time do we have?

13
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,445
I'm sorry but I'm gonna
have to go back to work.

24
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,302
- Evening, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Dawn.

25
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:03,941
- Let me take your coat.
- It's 8:00. Do you mind?

26
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,910
What is this?

27
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:08,343
Sweet'n low and coffee-mate.
I noticed you were out.

28
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,644
Is this an elaborate plea
for coffee? I can make some.

29
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:13,010
I really can't stay.

30
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:17,315
Mrs. Draper did not call this morning,

31
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,516
but I arranged for a
Valentine bouquet to arrive

32
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,120
in the afternoon her time, so I'd
expect a call here around dinner.

33
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,921
Good girl.

34
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,119
Mohawk airlines? Henry Lammott came in?

35
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,753
He just dropped in. He wanted to meet Lou.

36
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,355
Huh. Office or conference room?

37
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,657
- Conference room.
- Where'd he sit?

38
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,125
- Who?
- Lou.

39
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,361
I don't remember.

40
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,661
How'd diners club go on Tuesday?

41
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,199
It got pushed back for a
signing meeting with handi-wrap.

42
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,035
More dow? How long has that been going on?

43
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,937
I don't know. It's Mr. Cosgrove.

44
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,740
Clara's terrible with memos.

45
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,007
What creative team is on it?

46
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,376
I don't know.

47
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,111
- No other calls?
- No, Mr. Draper.

48
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,281
I know, I know. I told
you, it's for carfare.

49
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,717
Well, I've been thinking
about it a lot, actually.

50
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:08,287
And you know I don't mind
keeping you aware of things.

51
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,021
But there's something about the
money that makes it feel wrong.

52
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,423
You're doing extra work.
You should get extra pay.

53
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,525
It's no work at all.

54
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,929
So I will continue to do what I
feel comfortable doing for free,

55
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,932
which is answer your phone
and keep you up to date.

56
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,600
That's all I ask for.

57
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,702
No, you asked me to get you
photocopies of the Butler work

58
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,606
and they're locked in
Peggy's office and I can't.

59
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,110
I don't want you to do that.

60
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,780
All right. Good.

61
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:32,979
But I want you to take this.

62
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,891
- You take care.
- Of course.

63
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,761
The cleaning woman comes tomorrow morning.

64
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,141
(Sighs)

65
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:11,180
Carol: She says, "You
look like a working girl."

66
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:13,917
And I thought she meant I looked
low-class like a secretary.

67
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:16,289
But Petra said she meant a prostitute.

68
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,859
How the (Inaudible) Does my mother
know what a prostitute looks like?

69
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,661
How was Sarah?

70
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,429
Below average.

71
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:27,600
She wants me to bring her capezios, so
I don't know what I'm going to wear.

72
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:30,201
Is it an open casket?

73
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:32,369
I didn't ask.

74
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,543
Sergeant Snorkel says we have
to come back on the 12:30.

75
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,279
So back here by 3:00?

76
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,615
The funeral's at 9:00.

77
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,351
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.

78
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:44,691
Maybe we leave a little early
because Sally's so upset.

79
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:49,127
We get in a taxi to the cemetery, but
we get out in Greenwich Village.

80
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,997
Two hours of shopping, take
another pumpkin to grand central.

81
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:55,568
There's a boutique on McDougal
that has Pocahontas boots.

82
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,036
I am upset, Carol.

83
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,341
Me, too. I heard her dad's a mess.

84
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,808
She was supposed to be a great beauty.

85
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:08,848
Sarah had this picture of her
wearing a bikini on Christmas.

86
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,082
She took it with her.

87
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:15,153
You know she's gonna
miss school till easter?

88
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,489
I wish my mom was dead.

89
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:21,162
I'd stay here till 1975 if I
could get Betty in the ground.

90
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,864
What are you wearing?

91
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,201
I don't have anything
black but my turtleneck,

92
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:28,705
so I thought I'd wear that with my
brown suede skirt and black tights.

93
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,642
Jesus, Draper. Is this your first funeral?

94
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,713
(Laughing)

95
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:40,419
Leave the lights off.

96
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:42,388
How am I gonna find anything?

97
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,959
Why do you have to do this tonight?

98
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:58,407
- Hey.
- Didn't you already sign Chevy?

99
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:02,111
Can't you just add the business
onto their other contract?

100
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:05,414
Sweetheart, let me explain this to you.

101
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:09,052
This is the Southern California
Chevrolet dealers association.

102
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,858
Chevy's the factory, and this is the store.

103
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:16,631
You're not listening to me.

104
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:29,585
Just has to be there when he wakes up.

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,988
He's so drunk, he doesn't
even know where he is.

106
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:34,123
That's why it has to be
there when he wakes up

107
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:37,826
with a note that says, "You promised
to sign this no matter what."

108
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,627
(Moans)

109
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,795
You are such a big deal.

110
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,563
(Door opens)

111
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,033
How'd it go?

112
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,637
- I got 'em.
- Good work.

113
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:56,339
- Good night, Bonnie.
- Good night.

114
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:59,608
- (Door closes)
- (Both laughing)

115
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,374
(Elevator bell pings)

116
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,345
Peggy: Hold that, please.

117
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,652
Hello, New York.

118
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,288
Howdy.

119
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,390
Oh, Michael, very nice work on Butler.

120
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:18,854
Stan, we're gonna need renderings, color.

121
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,856
(Elevator bell pings)

122
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,693
How's Monday?

123
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,527
Today is Friday.

124
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,030
Whew, I'm buried all day
and I have plans tonight.

125
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,667
So you can finish tonight
and have plans all weekend.

126
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,634
- She's gonna find out.
- What?

127
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,201
(Sighs)

128
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,535
Maybe if you invite me,
you can have till Tuesday.

129
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,442
We now all know you don't
have plans for Valentine's day.

130
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,314
Oh.

131
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:48,650
She has plans. Look at her calendar.

132
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:51,587
"February 14, masturbate gloomily."

133
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:55,057
Monday is fine.

134
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,932
Who are these from?

135
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,873
Hard to believe your cat has the money.

136
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,178
Really lovely.

137
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:14,180
Look at you, every inch a girl.

138
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,948
Is this some kind of joke? Just tell me now

139
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:18,383
because I don't want to
have to fire you later.

140
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,950
Enjoy your flowers, boss.

141
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,435
Oh.

142
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,701
Happy Valentine's day, Shirley.

143
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,971
And happy Valentine's day to you.

144
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:48,340
Shirley, I see there's no card,

145
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:51,544
but I'd like to know who sent
me these beautiful flowers.

146
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,714
Well, actually...

147
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:57,017
Oh.

148
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:01,055
Oh.

149
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,457
I understand now.

150
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,692
Oh, good.

151
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,627
Could you get me some coffee?

152
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:08,462
What time is it on the coast?

153
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,497
- Pardon?
- 6:00 A.M.

154
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,834
I'll handle it.

155
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,338
Could you get the door?

156
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,112
(Phone rings)

157
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,049
Ted Chaough's office.

158
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,816
Good morning, Moira. It's Peggy.

159
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,149
Where are you?

160
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:35,023
I'm in my office, but I need you
to relay a message to Ted for me.

161
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:37,358
Oh, okay.

162
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:40,927
Tell him that I got his message.

163
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:49,932
No, tell him that I relayed
his message to the client and...

164
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,403
And what?

165
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:54,609
There's nothing he can do.

166
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:56,610
They're not...

167
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,712
They don't want to hear any more pitches.

168
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,513
The business is gone.

169
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:01,782
Really? What account?

170
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:04,322
He'll know.

171
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,702
Well, the snow's melted, but
not the hearts of new yorkers.

172
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:19,502
I just had some old lady call me a "kike."

173
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:21,568
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,504
She was letting her dog relieve himself

175
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:25,241
and I said, "Pardon me, but
you want to curb that thing?"

176
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,310
She says, "mind your own business, kike."

177
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,245
(Laughs) Maybe it's the hat.

178
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,448
The strangest things happen to you.

179
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,688
Hey, did you see this?
Ogilvy signed hershey.

180
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,124
I hadn't heard that.

181
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,994
(Man speaking on p.A.)

182
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,497
She hates her because she
got a c in Western civ.

183
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,366
She corrects my English.

184
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,101
I went to school in England.

185
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,704
Are we going to walk
into school with these?

186
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,573
We'll say they're Sarah's.

187
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,946
Is my purse in your bag?

188
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,887
The senior class sent her flowers
because they're all so concerned.

189
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,052
Half of them think her name is Sally.

190
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:13,855
Shit, I must have left
it at the coffee shop.

191
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,626
Maybe in the head shop?

192
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,128
I'm just going to go up
and check at the counter.

193
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,564
- I'll get your fare.
- No, my address book is in there.

194
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,733
- It's everybody I know.
- We can't wait.

195
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,169
There's another train in a couple hours.

196
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:32,109
- "Hello, Dawn."
- "Hello, Shirley."

197
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:35,048
You shouldn't be taking a
break right where you are.

198
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:38,651
I'm not. I'm getting her
coffee. And I'm taking my time.

199
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:41,818
- (Chuckles) What did she do now?
- It ain't funny.

200
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:46,826
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses
in a crystal vase and she took 'em.

201
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,128
I was right at the
photocopier when she came in

202
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,897
preparing her shit, and somehow...

203
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,767
'Cause I put the card in my purse, I guess

204
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,336
because it said, "I love you so"...

205
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,669
She thought they were hers.

206
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,407
Well, it was an honest mistake.

207
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:00,308
Who the hell is sending her flowers?

208
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:01,709
(Laughs)

209
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,751
Why didn't you say something?

210
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,120
It was too late. I ied.

211
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,623
- You tried?
- I really did.

212
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:23,495
Well, they're hers now.

213
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,763
I'm gonna tell her.

214
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:27,101
You want those flowers so bad,

215
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,001
you'll take the trouble that
comes with getting them back?

216
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,768
It's not right.

217
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:38,277
Well, I have two bosses and one of them
hasn't told his wife he's on leave.

218
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:40,281
Keep pretending.

219
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,485
That's your job.

220
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,789
Well, you know who I feel
the worst for is Charles.

221
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,626
He'd rather you have a job.

222
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,994
You know that's not true.

223
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,700
Happy Valentine's, Dawn.

224
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,236
Goodbye, Shirley.

225
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,472
Dave: You look good. Rested.

226
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,244
You said that. How do I usually look?

227
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,048
It's just that you've been so
busy for the last two years,

228
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:10,017
you've never taken me up for lunch.

229
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,154
I figured you're on some kind of break.

230
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:14,557
Maybe I'm doing research.

231
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,493
Maybe I want our place to be a little
bit more like Wells Rich Greene.

232
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,662
You'd have to have Mary.

233
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:22,332
And, you know, you probably could.

234
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,332
I knew you were gonna tell me
how great it is to work there,

235
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,702
but I didn't think
that's where you'd start.

236
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,577
So you looking to make a change?

237
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,713
I have a job.

238
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,616
I have a contract and a noncompete clause.

239
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,918
And I'm a partner.

240
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,621
Look, I don't know what the truth
is and I don't really care.

241
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,027
Someone said you were
dabbling in the LA office

242
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,463
or managing your wife's career.

243
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,797
People say things.

244
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,198
Well, then you probably heard the one

245
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:58,473
where you pulled a major boner in a
meeting and you cried or punched somebody

246
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:01,776
or something and that they cut you loose.

247
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,812
I didn't know I was gonna be interrogated

248
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,948
by the Hooterville telephone operator.

249
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,749
So it's not true?

250
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,715
You're spoiling the mood.

251
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:12,817
(Chuckles)

252
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:16,419
How about for a second date, we go
see the Knicks? Right on the floor.

253
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,421
Bradley's having one hell of a season.

254
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:22,255
That's a good idea.

255
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,953
Hello?

256
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:54,521
Can I help you, sweetheart?

257
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,755
Who are you?

258
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,761
I'm Mr. Avery. You looking for casting?

259
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:03,162
No, I'm looking for my Dad, Donald Draper.

260
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,402
Oh, well, he's not here.

261
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:11,975
Did he change offices?

262
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,811
Perfect.

263
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:19,281
Look, honey, he's not here.

264
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,886
He's probably at home. You should call him.

265
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,822
You know how to get an outside line?

266
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,623
Is Joan here?

267
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:30,762
That's a good idea.
Her office is right down there.

268
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,340
You know, I think everybody's at lunch.

269
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,609
(Thumps)

270
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:02,046
Have a nice day.

271
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:16,053
So she's sitting there
on the conference table

272
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:17,955
Indian-style in a dress and boots

273
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:20,391
like some kind of perverted
kindergarten teacher

274
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:23,759
and she says, "Well, thank you, Robert.

275
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,664
I know it's the best you can do."

276
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,066
What did Bob do?

277
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,703
Accepted his death gracefully.

278
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,442
I see a sheep and a wolf.

279
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:34,379
But which is which?

280
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,581
- How are you, Don?
- Great.

281
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:39,654
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.

282
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:41,523
We know each other.

283
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,358
So, Dave, how come you'll have
lunch with Don and not with me?

284
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:45,959
'Cause this is social.
He's not trying to buy us.

285
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:48,364
Well, what are you trying to do, Don?

286
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,066
Are you taking lunches now?

287
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,267
No, I'm just looking for love.

288
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:57,440
Well, on behalf of myself and all the
millionaires at McCann Erickson,

289
00:17:57,474 --> 00:18:00,677
we'd love a chance to tell
you how handsome you are

290
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,313
move along, Jim.

291
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:10,322
Tell Mary I picked up the
check, 'cause I just did.

292
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,090
I don't have to crap
on McCann for you, do I?

293
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:16,058
I almost worked there. Twice.

294
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,960
But you didn't.

295
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,141
Here, I want you to have these.

296
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:41,009
It smells like an Italian funeral in there.

297
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,749
(Keys cliing)

298
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:50,781
So then dessert finally
arrives and the ladies,

299
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,582
on cue, depart to the toilets.

300
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:57,457
And as we're standing, honeywell leans
in and says, "I like what I see."

301
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:00,759
Now, I thought he was making
a ribald comment about my date,

302
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:04,631
but he followed up by suggesting we
retire to the bar, just the two of us.

303
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:08,767
Is this a partners' meeting
or the most tedious

304
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,869
wireless program I've ever heard?

305
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,504
- (Chuckles)
- Pete: What?

306
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,004
What did he say?

307
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,940
We're on the edge of our seats.

308
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,644
- Hello, New York?
- He's saying get to it, Pete.

309
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,046
- Did you kiss the man or not?
- Fine.

310
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:26,115
Well, he didn't want to say it
in front of the boys from Detroit,

311
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,717
but he wants us to handle his business.

312
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,787
He rules the socal
dealerships with an iron fist.

313
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,687
- That's great.
- Wonderful.

314
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,322
- That's wonderful news.
- It is, isn't it?

315
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,525
They want us to start on the summer sale.

316
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,657
Sign them right away. Sit in his
yard with a pen if you have to.

317
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,691
Pete: Contract came with the milkman.

318
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,130
I'll get Bob Benson to fly in
from Detroit for the signing.

319
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:48,097
We don't want the tail wagging the dog.

320
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:51,232
They're the dealers association.

321
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,035
They bill almost as much as Chevy does.

322
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,503
They are the dog.

323
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,505
- He's right.
- Just a minute.

324
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,807
Chevy's our client and
they're our entree to GM,

325
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:02,646
which bills more than
everything on the planet.

326
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,747
I would tell Detroit
we've got this opportunity

327
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,181
and I would ask for their blessing.

328
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:09,752
Look, when I brought in Chevy, I got
their very own Mikey O'Brien laid.

329
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:12,654
Sorry, sweetheart. And it
wasn't easy. Sorry again.

330
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:15,588
Pete caught him. Let Pete mount him.

331
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,557
Can we move on?

332
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,664
This phone call is already
eating into our fee.

333
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:23,100
Ted, weren't you there
when we signed Chevy?

334
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,537
Roger seems to have failed
to get a head count.

335
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:28,176
I don't see any reason to keep score.

336
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,913
Gentlemen, this is good news.

337
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:33,247
And I have no problem
with flying to Detroit

338
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,949
and briefing Bob and all those...

339
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,515
I'll bring oranges.

340
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,388
- Ted? Are you there?
- (Static hisses)

341
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:43,191
Hello, California?

342
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,727
- Dee, can you hear us?
- Yes, I can.

343
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:48,897
- Dee?
- (Sighs)

344
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,366
What's wrong with you?
I say up, you say down.

345
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,701
I'm surprised you're disagreeing with me.

346
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,567
It's common sense.

347
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,267
I think they can't hear us.

348
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:59,070
We can hear you!

349
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,708
Pete can service the account, but he
will report to our man in Detroit

350
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:06,781
where said parties ll be
offered the right of refusal.

351
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:09,785
I remember very clearly
when Don and I signed Chevy.

352
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,956
Don who? Our collective ex-wife
who still receives alimony?

353
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:17,262
- Hang up.
- Pete: No.

354
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,731
Roger: This is a partners' meeting.

355
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,133
Let's poll the partners, shall we?

356
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,239
- Aye.
- Aye what?

357
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:23,707
I agree with Jim.

358
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,810
Moira, fix the phone.

359
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,978
I feel caught off guard
by having a confrontation

360
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:32,482
over something that seems rudimentary.

361
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:35,517
(Phone clicks)

362
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:41,752
They never said which of
Peggy's accounts we lost.

363
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:44,054
Call me when you fix the damn phone.

364
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:48,491
Let me try out there.

365
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,092
What difference could that possibly make?

366
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,760
I thought we were gonna
get a new one of these.

367
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,730
And why the hell aren't
we in the conference room?

368
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,668
Do not go after him.

369
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,504
Moira.

370
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,640
You can reach me in my office.

371
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,047
(TV playing)

372
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,150
Hello?

373
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,484
Marta?

374
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,217
Oh, I looked everywhere for you.

375
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,152
What are you doing here?

376
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:21,156
What happened? Is everything okay?

377
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,992
Obviously not.

378
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,663
Where were you?

379
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:25,897
I was at the office.

380
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,864
What?

381
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,736
I wasn't feeling well. I left early.

382
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:35,477
What happened? Does your
mother know where you are?

383
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:38,013
What? No.

384
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:40,283
You're not supposed to be off campus.

385
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:46,560
My roommate's mother died and
they let us go to the funeral,

386
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,863
but I lost my purse.

387
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:54,171
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

388
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:57,873
I just need money for the train.

389
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,079
And I guess I need a note of excuse.

390
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:04,714
I'll drive you.

391
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:08,151
No, it's okay. You're not feeling well.

392
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,553
I'll be fine.

393
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:12,890
You really don't have to.

394
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,096
It looks like you have a lot of work to do.

395
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,201
Come on, it'll be nice. We'll take a drive.

396
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:20,904
What's the note supposed to say?

397
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:22,274
What?

398
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:24,779
Sally, what do I say?

399
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,949
Just tell the truth.

400
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:40,330
Where the hell were you?

401
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:42,333
I was getting your perfume.

402
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,336
- Draper's daughter showed up.
- Sally was here?

403
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:47,508
I don't know her name.
She was looking for him.

404
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,676
My lord. What did you say?

405
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,646
I said he's probably at
home. It's not my problem.

406
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,947
I have to call him.

407
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,849
Call him?

408
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,283
You have to call him? Okay.

409
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:01,019
Don't bother apologizing to me, I guess.

410
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,993
- I'm very sorry.
- (Thumps)

411
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:09,462
Want to go before we go?

412
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:11,131
- (Phone rings)
- I'm fine.

413
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,436
- Hello.
- It's Dawn.

414
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,306
And I'm really sorry. I
don't know what happened,

415
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,842
but Sally came into the
office and she talked to Lou.

416
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,514
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

417
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,951
But I wanted you to know
that she might be on her way.

418
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,986
Okay. Thank you, Dawn.

419
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:38,829
Do you have to stay?

420
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:41,196
No.

421
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,899
Let's go.

422
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,566
Hello, Dawn.

423
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,133
Lou said he wanted to see me.

424
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,998
Oh.

425
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,532
- (Buzzes)
- Lou, Joan's here to see you.

426
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:58,200
Lou: Actually, I need
to see the both of you.

427
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,410
Get the door.

428
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:20,654
When I generously agreed to share
Dawn here with Don Draper,

429
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,324
it was for the purposes
of his correspondence

430
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,527
and incoming phone calls,
not cleaning up his messes.

431
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,726
One of those things
is very time-consuming.

432
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,093
- What happened?
- His daughter came by.

433
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,494
Why are we going through all this?

434
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,097
I know you can't fire her. Just move
her to another part of the building.

435
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:39,366
Lou, I will take care of this.

436
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:42,668
- What do you mean by that?
- I want my own girl.

437
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:45,836
- Come along, Dawn.
- In a minute.

438
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,439
Obviously I can say anything I want.

439
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:50,107
But you don't want to.

440
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:53,075
I skipped my lunch to
buy your wife perfume.

441
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:56,910
If you had been thoughtful
enough to get her a gift

442
00:25:56,944 --> 00:26:00,313
when I told you about it 10
days ago, I would have been here.

443
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:03,548
Do you understand? It's not my problem.

444
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:06,384
None of this has anything to do with me.

445
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,753
I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing.

446
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,961
Was that necessary?

447
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,830
When she comes back from the ladies',
have her hand over the keys.

448
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,175
New York is on the line.

449
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,742
Do you have to put them on the contraption?

450
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,945
It's just Mr. Sterling.

451
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,482
- This is Pete.
- It's Roger.

452
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,817
I appreciate you fighting for me.

453
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:45,524
Well, Jim pled his case and we decided
it's best to keep the business,

454
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,593
but run it past Detroit.

455
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:50,327
- Which means Bob gets involved.
- What?

456
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:52,697
Jim and I had a meaningful conversation...

457
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:55,370
I heard your conversation.
You're full of it.

458
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:58,505
That is just the kind of weakness that
got us in this position to begin with.

459
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:01,206
Let me just go to Detroit. I'm sure...

460
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,875
...something to do with Bob
or my feelings towards Bob,

461
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,147
but it really doesn't. It's a chance for me

462
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,983
to rectify my status with those people.

463
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,554
And in the end, that's our
best route to new business.

464
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,357
Dee: He disconnected.

465
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,060
- (Sighs)
- (Bangs)

466
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:21,669
Why even bring in an account?

467
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:28,509
They're just gonna take it away.

468
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:34,648
Sometimes I think maybe I died
and I'm in some kind of...

469
00:27:34,682 --> 00:27:37,550
I don't know if it's
heaven or hell or limbo.

470
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,885
But I don't seem to exist.

471
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,219
No one feels my existence.

472
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:45,322
Just cash the checks.
You're gonna die one day.

473
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,660
What you're supposed to say is,

474
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:50,529
"hey, why don't we just
start our own agency?"

475
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:52,563
At least the goal would be clear.

476
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,666
I mean, what am I working for here?

477
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,367
There's two offices.

478
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,335
Yours is only slightly better than mine.

479
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:01,771
What am I supposed to do,
work my way up to your office?

480
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,039
You can have my office.

481
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:05,208
No, that is not the point.

482
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,047
Cutler sent you out here
because you're too moral.

483
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:12,249
He couldn't look you in
the face and be machiavelli.

484
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:13,684
That's not why I'm here.

485
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:15,219
Why are you here?

486
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:17,188
All you do is answer the
phone and mope around.

487
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,158
You know what?

488
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:20,895
We're not talking anymore.

489
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,865
From now on, we'll both
pretend I'm in New York.

490
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:27,735
(Door closes)

491
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:32,209
Joan wants us to switch desks.

492
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,708
Don't feel bad. It's not your fault.

493
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:37,377
I know.

494
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:40,350
Don't be sore, but I'm really happy.

495
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,454
I need a box.

496
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,724
She wants you out front right now.

497
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:49,963
Okay. Well, just a few things.

498
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,368
He takes it light with two sweet'n lows.

499
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,104
Always put through his son Earl.

500
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,738
These three lines are Lou's
and this one is Mr. Draper's.

501
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,408
Maybe I should get a pencil.

502
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,541
You know what?

503
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:07,076
I'll have Mr. Draper's calls come
straight to me at reception.

504
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,884
"Elenore" playing

505
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,551
♪ elenore, can I take the time ♪

506
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:25,087
♪ To ask you to speak your mind? ♪

507
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:27,826
How old was your friend's mother?

508
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,296
She's not my friend.

509
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,764
She's my roommate.

510
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,400
Where was the funeral?

511
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,736
81st and Madison.

512
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:39,572
Where was she buried?

513
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:43,512
In Queens by the racetrack.

514
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:46,783
So you left your purse at the cemetery?

515
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,786
I'm not sure. That's why it's lost.

516
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,922
Why are you interrogating me?

517
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:54,922
Because I know you went to my office.

518
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:58,428
So I find your story a little suspicious.

519
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,427
My story? There's some man in your office.

520
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:03,796
- We're not talking about me.
- Did you lose your job?

521
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,364
Why were you in the city?
I want to know this minute.

522
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,802
I don't have to tell you anything.

523
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:10,339
Just stop the car.

524
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:13,140
- I'm talking to you.
- You're yelling at me.

525
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,373
Why would you just let
me lie to you like that?

526
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:18,509
Because it's more embarrassing
for me to catch you in a lie

527
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,377
than it is for you to be lying.

528
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,880
So you just laid in wait like your mother?

529
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:27,813
Do you know how hard it was for
me to go to your apartment?

530
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,282
I could have run into that woman.

531
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:34,821
I could be in the
elevator, she could get in

532
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:37,324
and I'd have to stand there smiling

533
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,360
wanting to vomit while
I smell her hairspray.

534
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,661
♪ Elenore, gee ♪

535
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:47,697
♪ I think you're swell... ♪

536
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:49,666
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,202
Please, stop.

538
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:52,935
I'm not stopping the car.

539
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,904
Stop talking.

540
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,407
Man on radio: News five minutes
sooner from wabc New York.

541
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,609
News at 55 and 25.

542
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,945
It's 29 degrees here in New York.

543
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:05,047
A chilly Valentine's evening to you.

544
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,816
- I have to get gas.
- The Los Angeles trial of sirhan sirhan...

545
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,588
- (Intercom buzzes)
- Shirley: I have Dee for you.

546
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,798
Who the hell is Dee?

547
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:24,068
From the Los Angeles office.

548
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:26,875
She has Mr. Chaough on the line.

549
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,611
You've got to be kidding
me. Tell him I'm busy.

550
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,948
Do you want me to take a message?

551
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:34,320
No, I want you to leave a message.

552
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,724
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

553
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:41,397
Tell her to tell Ted that I have no
intention of talking to him today.

554
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,498
And that's it. That's all I said.

555
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:45,799
Okay.

556
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:51,003
That's what she said.

557
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:56,611
You know what, Shirley?

558
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:59,451
I've been thinking about
it and I know it's silly,

559
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,920
but could you please
throw these flowers away?

560
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,421
Why?

561
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,356
I'm sorry, but they're cursed.

562
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,325
No, they're not. They're beautiful.

563
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,629
Look, I should have bought
you flowers out of respect,

564
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,965
not because of some holiday.

565
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,268
Are these some symbol
of how much we're loved?

566
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:24,108
- It's a joke.
- Please, don't.

567
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,309
I'll get you some new ones.

568
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,642
Please, those are my flowers.

569
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:29,676
They're from my fiance.

570
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,014
- Since when?
- Since this morning.

571
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,950
Why didn't you tell me?

572
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:37,350
You didn't give me a chance.

573
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:39,551
I didn't give you a chance?

574
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:43,020
They've been sitting in there all day.

575
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,955
- Now you're just embarrassing me.
- I didn't mean to.

576
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:47,521
You know what?
You should have never told me.

577
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:49,692
That would have been a great gift.

578
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:51,860
Who cares about your stupid flowers?

579
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:54,496
You have a ring on.
We all know that you're engaged.

580
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,366
You did not have to embarrass me.

581
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,502
Grow up.

582
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:14,623
10:00 A.M.? Thank you.

583
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:25,272
- (Knocks)
- Come in.

584
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:31,247
I just wanted to say I
was on my way to the club

585
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:35,118
and I noticed there's
been a change in reception.

586
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:36,754
I had to shuffle the girls.

587
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:40,959
Well, I'm all for the national
advancement of colored people,

588
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,494
but I do not believe they should advance

589
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:45,694
all the way to the front of this office.

590
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,431
People can see her from the elevator.

591
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:51,332
I'm sorry.

592
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,969
Do you want me to dismiss her
based on the color of her skin?

593
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:56,340
I said nothing of the kind.

594
00:33:56,375 --> 00:34:00,713
I'm merely suggesting a rearrangement
of your rearrangement.

595
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,314
Suggesting?

596
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,551
Requesting.

597
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:14,794
Pete: Hello?

598
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:16,862
Bonnie?

599
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,964
Pete?

600
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:20,868
Hello, Valentine.

601
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:23,337
What a pleasant surprise.

602
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,340
Did you come to see me work?

603
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:27,744
Because I wasn't expecting you till 5:00.

604
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:29,878
There's been a change of plans.

605
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:32,181
You're going to be
showing me around your body

606
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:34,352
at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel.

607
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:37,421
The devil and his temptations.

608
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:40,191
I'll be there at 5:15
unless I get an offer.

609
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,126
You have an offer.

610
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,561
I love my flowers.

611
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,695
And I love you.

612
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,997
But I also love the 15 strangers
who might buy this dump.

613
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:52,931
(Scoffs)

614
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,333
Well, excuse me if I don't
see the point right now.

615
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:57,937
I mean, I landed that whale
and New York just took it away.

616
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,272
And I realized if the
system's rigged against me,

617
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,607
I might as well enjoy myself.

618
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:08,953
I once sold a house for $108,000.

619
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:12,723
Two weeks later, during
escrow, it burned down.

620
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:16,361
I had driven this okie
couple around for a year.

621
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:21,432
Bought lunches, looked at pictures
of their hideous children.

622
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:24,232
Do you know where Altadena is?

623
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,399
Might as well be Barstow.

624
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:29,102
I'd show up and have to change my blouse

625
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:32,406
because the sweat stains were
meeting between my breasts.

626
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:37,039
I could have lived for
months on that commission.

627
00:35:37,074 --> 00:35:42,207
And then it was all gone because some
asshole barreling down Lake Avenue

628
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,376
threw his cigarette out the window.

629
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,249
I'm sorry, but it's not the same.

630
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:50,718
It's worse. I'm in sales, too.

631
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:54,453
Not some housewife complaining about
getting oatmeal out of a carpet.

632
00:35:54,488 --> 00:36:01,262
An act of God, Pete, that's how you know
when things are really against you.

633
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:03,629
You don't seem very upset about it.

634
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,430
'Cause that's the thrill.

635
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:12,836
Our fortunes are in other people's
hands and we have to take them.

636
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,404
(Doorbell rings)

637
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,806
I want to chew you up and spit you out.

638
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,844
Put the sign back.

639
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,528
"Your name and mine" playing

640
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:44,764
♪ your name and mine ♪

641
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:47,035
♪ Carved on a tree... ♪

642
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,537
Sure you don't want anything?

643
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:51,473
I told you, I'm not hungry.

644
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:53,844
How are your studies?

645
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,580
Spectacular.

646
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,648
Do you want a French fry?

647
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,689
They're cold.

648
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,157
Know what? I'm gonna get some coffee.

649
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,896
I should probably call my friends.

650
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,096
They're probably worried.

651
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:20,196
Want ice cream or something?

652
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,332
Did you even need gas?

653
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,371
I wanted to talk to you.

654
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,211
The reason I didn't
tell you I wasn't working

655
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:39,244
is because I didn't want anyone to know.

656
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:41,780
Got it.

657
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:45,652
I didn't behave well.

658
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:49,991
I said the wrong things to the
wrong people at the wrong time.

659
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:52,528
What did you say?

660
00:37:56,596 --> 00:38:00,001
I told the truth about myself.

661
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:02,302
But it wasn't the right time.

662
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,369
So they made me take some time off.

663
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:13,546
I was ashamed.

664
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,620
What was the truth?

665
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:20,557
Nothing you don't know.

666
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:24,729
So what are you gonna do?

667
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,969
I don't know.

668
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,504
It's kind of up to them.

669
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:36,744
If you're not going to work,

670
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,249
because I wanted to be here to fix it.

671
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:46,621
- How?
- (Chuckles)

672
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:51,490
(Softly) I don't know.

673
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:54,461
Do you still love Megan?

674
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,130
Of course I do.

675
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:58,132
You know I visit every couple weeks.

676
00:38:58,166 --> 00:39:00,834
I talk to her all the time.

677
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:04,302
Why don't you just tell her that
you don't want to move to California?

678
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,143
Go ahead.

679
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,045
- Can I get a coke?
- Sure.

680
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,727
(Phone ringing)

681
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,313
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- What do you want, Peggy?

682
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,513
(Sighs) Well, I'd like Shirley off my desk.

683
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:49,152
What? What did she do?

684
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:54,189
There was an incident today and I'm
not comfortable with her on my desk.

685
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,756
I shouldn't have to
tell you more than that.

686
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,626
- So just fire her.
- I didn't say that.

687
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,328
She can work anywhere in the office
you want. I just want someone else.

688
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,297
Fine.

689
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:06,204
- You can share Moira.
- She hates me.

690
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,809
- Meredith.
- She has the mind of a child.

691
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,876
Damn it, Peggy!

692
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,344
Dawn can't work with Lou.

693
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:14,149
Neither of them can work out front.

694
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:16,585
Scarlett and Harry are practically married.

695
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,721
- What do you want me to do?
- Fix it.

696
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:22,756
All I know is that today was a workday
and I didn't get anything done.

697
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:26,324
(Knocks)

698
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:28,925
- What do you want?!
- I'm sorry.

699
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:33,659
Since the meeting was aborted, I wanted
to get some details regarding Avon.

700
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,760
But perhaps now is not a good time.

701
00:40:35,794 --> 00:40:38,365
We're just having some personnel issues.

702
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:44,536
I just realized you have
two jobs, don't you?

703
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:48,441
- I'm not complaining.
- Maybe you should.

704
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:50,343
What are the skills required down here?

705
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:51,944
Organization? Fortitude?

706
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:53,880
Lack of concern for being unliked?

707
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:56,783
(Chuckles) I suppose.

708
00:40:58,153 --> 00:40:59,855
Well...

709
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:02,689
There's an office open upstairs.

710
00:41:02,724 --> 00:41:06,263
It's for an account man,
not the head of personnel.

711
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,733
What do you mean?

712
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:10,802
Let me know what you decide.

713
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,871
We can talk about Avon on Monday.

714
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,276
Good night.

715
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,430
<i>- Carol: Hello.
- It's me.</i>

716
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:23,331
Where the hell are you?

717
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:24,931
We've got you covered till lights out.

718
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:26,664
Ankle fat thinks you're
at a church somewhere

719
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,098
with Sarah crying on your shoulder.

720
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,367
Thanks, but I'm with my dad.

721
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,269
He wrote me a note.

722
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,704
You're never going to believe
what happened on the train.

723
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:37,040
There was this creepy
salesman from milford.

724
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:39,710
He's really old, but he keeps smiling at us

725
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,845
and he wants to take us to the smoker.

726
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,683
- Yolanda said...
- You know what, Carol?

727
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:48,288
- I should go.
- Well, we hid your Booty.

728
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:51,224
Your sandals, they're in the back
of the closet next to your cleats.

729
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,692
So at least the trip was worth it.

730
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:57,697
I'll see you later. Bye.

731
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:07,506
What's this?

732
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,910
I got you a Patty melt.

733
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:12,078
Everything okay?

734
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,278
Mm-hmm.

735
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,755
I don't like you going to funerals.

736
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:30,228
It was awful.

737
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:33,166
Sarah's mom was yellow.

738
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,933
She was wearing this wig.

739
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:38,937
I hate that you had to see that.

740
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,442
I only went so I could go shopping.

741
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,510
I doubt that.

742
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:47,549
I don't know.

743
00:42:49,753 --> 00:42:51,889
Life goes on.

744
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,461
I'm so many people.

745
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:17,447
Can you see the car from here?

746
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:20,417
Yes.

747
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:21,952
Good.

748
00:43:21,987 --> 00:43:23,722
I want you to finish your meal.

749
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:25,725
I'm gonna go out to the
car and get it running.

750
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:27,592
Then you walk out.

751
00:43:29,528 --> 00:43:31,998
We're not gonna pay.

752
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:35,763
Really?

753
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:02,453
Don't bother with the
flowers. Everyone's gone.

754
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:04,122
No, these are mine.

755
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:07,026
They're from my son. Thank you, Roger.

756
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,330
Well, I bet he's gonna be pretty
upset if he sees you giving them away.

757
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,967
I'not. I'm taking them to my new office.

758
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,470
Up here?

759
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:18,274
It was suggested that I move
now that I have some accounts.

760
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:20,042
Jim suggested it?

761
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:21,475
Do you disagree?

762
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,311
Does it matter?

763
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:39,361
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.

764
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:04,221
(Phone ringing)

765
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:14,436
Ah, hello.

766
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:16,738
Hello.

767
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:24,410
Apparently we're going to finish
that conference call on Monday.

768
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:26,345
That won't be necessary.

769
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,746
I set Pete straight.

770
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,147
Hmm, glad to hear it.

771
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:36,782
I'd hate to think of you as an adversary.

772
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:41,385
(Softly) I'd really hate that.

773
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:09,715
You sure I don't have to
go in and talk to anyone?

774
00:46:09,749 --> 00:46:11,684
No, I have the note.

775
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:22,332
Happy Valentine's day. I love you.

776
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:31,604
