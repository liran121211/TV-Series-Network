Previously on Mad Men:

2
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:04,675
- We'll be bicoastal.
- I quit my job.

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:05,702
Megan.

4
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:07,383
You wanted to be alone.

5
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,929
I love you, I'm going to leave my wife.

6
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:12,728
I'm your daughter.

7
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,831
What do I have to do to
get on the list of girls you give money to?

8
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:19,121
- When are you leaving for Los Angeles?
- It's not the way I wanted it.

9
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,939
We think it's best for you and the firm

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,940
if you take some time off and regroup.

11
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,241
I want a return date.

12
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:27,242
I've been doing account work in one form
or another since the day I started.

13
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:28,805
But you're not in that department.

14
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:30,346
I'm going to California.

15
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,851
Let this be the past.

16
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:32,881
Get out.

17
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,020
Hello, Don. This is Lou Avery,
from Dancer Fitzgerald.

18
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:37,031
We've met.

19
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:38,729
I've got to much to do.

20
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,326
And you thought you'd do it in here.

22
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:30,470
Are you ready? Because I
want you to pay attention.

23
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,978
This is the beginning of something.

24
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,611
Do you have time to improve your life?

25
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:39,586
Do you have precisely 30 seconds
for a word from Accutron Watches?

26
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,720
The watch appears bottom third.

27
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:44,054
The second hand moves with a fluid sweep

28
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:46,761
and above it... "Accutron Time."

29
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,735
You go into a business meeting.

30
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,612
Is there food in your
teeth? Ashes on your tie?

31
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,212
And you've got nothing to say.

32
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,279
The meeting is boring, but you can't be.

33
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,349
But you're wearing an Accutron.

34
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,756
This watch makes you interesting.

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,365
It's a boardroom. It's black and white.

36
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,432
We hear light traffic. No talking.

37
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:08,135
We just see our man, you, late 20s,

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,108
shaggy with a youthful cowlick,

39
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,745
but in a suit and tie.

40
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,249
This is a businessman staring at his watch

41
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:17,154
as muffled conversation swirls around him.

42
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:20,028
Now we just hear the electronic hum.

43
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:22,868
Omm-mm.

44
00:02:24,038 --> 00:02:26,606
He stands up and the faces come into view.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,214
A couple of white-haired
men and a contemporary

46
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,115
who looks like Steve McQueen.

47
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,455
You shake hands and "Steve
McQueen" gets a look at your watch.

48
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,362
We hear the first words. "Is that Swiss?"

49
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:41,935
Now we're in color and it's a
little interview for the two of them

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,478
while the other men look, outlining
the benefits of this watch.

51
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:48,416
It is Swiss. It is accurate.

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,784
It is the height of design and technology.

53
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,955
"Accutron. It's not a timepiece.

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,194
It's a conversation piece."

55
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,231
Wow, Freddy.

56
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,602
That's a home run.

57
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,670
Actually, it's kind of an end run.

58
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:14,110
That is not what I expected.

59
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,778
There's a nice way to say that

60
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,946
and there's the way you just said it.

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,180
Well, it's really good.

62
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,551
They're going to resist
that black and white thing.

63
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,923
Yeah, but nobody's done
it. Not that I know of.

64
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:29,361
"Accutron, it's time for a conversation."

65
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,335
It's not as dramatic
and it hides the benefit.

66
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:34,739
I don't know. It sounds more elegant to me.

67
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:37,274
Yes?

68
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,343
You wanted me to tell you when it was
five minutes until the status meeting.

69
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,711
Thank you, Shirley.

70
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,347
So, I'll see you next week.

71
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,082
I'm gonna have another cup of coffee.

72
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,520
You really put the "free"
in freelancer, don't you?

73
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,076
Ahem. Hello?

74
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,678
Hello, Daddy.

75
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,447
Oh.

76
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:12,983
How are you, honey?

77
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm well.

78
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,524
I thought I'd catch you
before you went to the office.

79
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,628
Right.

80
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,232
I'd like to have brunch Sunday morning.

81
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,934
Sure. That'd be nice.

82
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,171
I'll bring vodka. We'll have Bloody Marys.

83
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,575
No, in a restaurant.

84
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,678
How about the Plaza? They have vodka.

85
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,945
It'll just be me.

86
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,612
Sounds touching.

87
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,579
10:30. Bye-bye.

88
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,582
Bye, honey.

89
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,491
I feel like we really
got somewhere last night.

90
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,837
Hello, Dawn.

91
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,173
- Gentlemen.
- The team is here.

92
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:56,574
Fire when ready.

93
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,847
How long is this meeting?

94
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,619
That depends on you, doesn't it?

95
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,586
Who do we have here?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

96
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,022
That's very hip, Lou.

97
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,325
- Should I get the door, Lou?
- Yes, Nurse.

98
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,665
So, how is everybody today?

99
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,602
Ready for your routine checkup?

100
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:24,737
Just open your mouths and say "ahh."

101
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,974
Gentlemen.

102
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:36,411
Get me those brand reviews.

103
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,379
It's a deadline, knuckleheads!

104
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:39,881
You know what it says to me?

105
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,518
It says you don't care.

106
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,287
And anybody who doesn't care
doesn't have to work here!

107
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,890
And you do not have the weekend!

108
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,929
- I can come back.
- No.

109
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:58,466
Clara, can I get a buttered
roll, please, from the lobby?

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
Yes, of course.

111
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,035
Come on in.

112
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,745
What are you holding?

113
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,179
It's Avon. You said you wanted to see me.

114
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:12,747
How many accounts do I have?

115
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,048
Well, it's all of them.

116
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,152
It feels like more.

117
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,122
I'm walking into this office every day

118
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:20,457
and I barely get ahead of things
before I get Bob from Detroit

119
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:23,191
around noon and Pete from LA around 2:00.

120
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,994
Is this Avon related,

121
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,128
or did you just need
someone to hand you a tissue?

122
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,531
I have no real help except Torkelson,

123
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,134
who's Cutler's guy.

124
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,769
And I think he's making Clara nightly.

125
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:36,335
- That's juicy.
- He can have her.

126
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:40,071
The point is Butler Footwear
just hired a new head of marketing

127
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,906
and if I meet with him, it's a demotion.

128
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,075
You're head of accounts.
He'll think he's important.

129
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,643
That's what it looks like to him.

130
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,878
But to Charles Butler
Jr., it looks like I'm only

131
00:06:47,912 --> 00:06:49,882
as important as his head of marketing.

132
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,318
If I have no underlings, I'm useless.

133
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,286
Have Roger or Cutler meet with him.

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,921
That's two dumb ideas.
You're not listening to me.

135
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,924
This is a hierarchy.
Do you understand that?

136
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:03,365
Tell him I couldn't make
it at the last minute.

137
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:09,274
I'm having dinner with Jerry
Lewis or GM or somebody.

138
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:10,709
No, don't mention other clients.

139
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,482
Certainly.

140
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,485
I appreciate your confidence in me.

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,689
- Make him go away.

142
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,058
I have your roll and I have
Bob Benson on the line.

143
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,328
You see this? I don't
have time to take a crap.

144
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,036
And last but not least,

145
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,969
any news from the Motor City?

146
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,307
Chevy XP collateral is
scheduled to go to press Monday.

147
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,210
- Hallelujah.
- But we don't have approved copy.

148
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,812
We don't even have a name for it.

149
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:41,979
Dang it.

150
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,015
Chevy graphics people keep telling me

151
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,985
there's a "Chevy way" of doing things.

152
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,156
- And money is no object.
- Get it in writing.

153
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:52,755
You didn't pick an angle for Accutron.

154
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,390
Wow, is that today?

155
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,626
Sure, I did. Dawn, what did I say?

156
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,399
"Just in time to be on time."

157
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,301
That wasn't one of the choices.
I think that was a digression.

158
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,772
How about "Accutron is accurate"?

159
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,773
That was one of the choices, I'm positive.

160
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:10,310
"It's time for a conversation."

161
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,412
I think that one's more finished.

162
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,613
And I think you're putting
me in a position of saying

163
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,947
I don't care what you think.

164
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,983
Why would you put something in front
of me that you don't want me to pick?

165
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,252
Because you told me to give you two ideas.

166
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,118
You apparently only gave me one.

167
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:26,885
Last week I gave you 30 choices

168
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,451
and you told me to bring you two.

169
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:30,286
That's the way we do it.

170
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,092
I like your car.

171
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:41,559
Your flight was late. We
don't have time to go home.

172
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,996
One quick dinner, and the rest
of the weekend we're alone.

173
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,767
So let's go.

174
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:51,139
I can't move the seat.

175
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,658
Where should we start, DDB or K&E?

176
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,394
Surprise me.

177
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,262
Oh, hey.

178
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,075
Well, hello there.

179
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:27,645
Why aren't you brown?

180
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,515
- It's January in LA, too.
- That's no excuse.

181
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,885
Oh, Moira, can you remind me to pick up
two dozen bagels before the end of my trip?

182
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,125
Aha.

183
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,263
So, the missus misses New York.

184
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,098
No, they are for Pete.
Nan loves California.

185
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,067
Aren't you done with your adventure?

186
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,201
You know how many times I've
come down here looking for fun?

187
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:47,436
Isn't Lou fun?

188
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,104
Lou's great. We just miss you.

189
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,474
Why don't you move St.
Joseph's back another day?

190
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,209
You'll still have time to catch up.

191
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,214
You can come to the inauguration with me.

192
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,017
I'm supposed to take Sterling,

193
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:02,286
but say the word, I'll jettison.

194
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,855
Moira, let's start with Chevy.

195
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:05,956
You're really going to work?

196
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,827
Pencil him in for tomorrow.

197
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,234
That's what I've been saying.

198
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:17,171
I know. Okay, Ira. I've got to go.

199
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,873
Hello, Alan.

200
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,607
I'm sorry, I think I'm a little early.

201
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:23,143
First actress ever to say that.

202
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:25,644
You look wonderful, honey.

203
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,312
- Don Draper, this is Alan Silver.
- Don't get up.

204
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,287
The husband is a matinee idol.

205
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,424
I told you.

206
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,228
Don, I want to get one
thing out of the way.

207
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:43,331
Know that it was important
to me that you know

208
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,598
the man your wife is
spending so much time with.

209
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:47,965
I assure you, it's greed

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,469
and nothing else.

211
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,441
I feel completely at ease.

212
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,942
My partners in New York
promise a lot of things

213
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,276
to girls when they come West.

214
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,179
They passed off a lot of dogs.

215
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:00,281
But your girl is something.

216
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:04,084
I mean, she's the kind of girl
who's gonna shine for the network

217
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:05,753
in her callback for the
"Bracken's World" pilot.

218
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,221
What?

219
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,791
- Get out of here.
- I will not.

220
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,326
I thought the guy hated me.

221
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,161
But his boss loved you.

222
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:14,928
I'll say one thing about this girl,

223
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,332
she evokes strong feelings.

224
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,473
I feel like I just ate
a bag of butterflies.

225
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,477
Let's celebrate.

226
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,780
Young man.

227
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,817
Let me get a bottle of French champagne

228
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,821
for my French TV star here.

229
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,857
I can't believe it. When is it?

230
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:34,493
Wednesday, 9:15. We can hold
off on fixing your teeth.

231
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,428
Obviously I jumped the gun on that.

232
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:37,729
Okay.

233
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:40,597
What network?

234
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,232
NBC.

235
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,201
Such great news, honey.

236
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:48,170
Look at you two.

237
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:50,304
You're my favorite couple.

238
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:01,278
- Mr. Barnes? Wayne?
- That's me.

239
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,982
I'm Joan Harris from SC&P.

240
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,783
Should I tell them that
we're ready for a table?

241
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,017
Maybe we should wait for Ken.

242
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,217
Please, sit.

243
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:14,055
What can I get you?

244
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,957
I'll have a Coke.

245
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:18,025
Two Cokes.

246
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,827
I'm so sorry. Ken was
called away on an emergency

247
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,095
and rather than risk cancelling
on someone so important,

248
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,598
he asked that I stand in.

249
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:28,002
Look, I must be crazy to be disappointed.

250
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:30,636
I'm sure you had a hard
time keeping this seat empty,

251
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,503
but this conversation is best for Ken.

252
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,943
Tell me about your new position.

253
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,612
Head of marketing.

254
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,781
That's not just new for you,
that's new for Butler Footwear.

255
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,816
They pay me to think about the four Ps...

256
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,752
price, product, place,
and promotion. Thank you.

257
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,157
That's a smart way to think about it.

258
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,826
I have a degree in business.

259
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,660
It's not a science, but
we try to make it one.

260
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:55,865
Advertising is just a small
piece of the marketing mixture

261
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,702
and it might be more effective if it's
better integrated into our business.

262
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,271
So are you thinking about bringing

263
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,408
one of our account
executives into your office?

264
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,845
Actually, I'd like to move
all our advertising in-house.

265
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,120
It does sound like the conversation
is getting bigger than the two of us.

266
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,388
There's someone above
you and someone below you

267
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,489
and everybody's buying everybody dinner.

268
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,291
Wouldn't it be cheaper for Mr.
Butler to just walk down the hall?

269
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:28,159
SC&P's relationship with Butler Footwear

270
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:30,060
is very important to our company.

271
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:32,995
And I think you're being
shortsighted about our value.

272
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,129
Well, I was hired to be bold.

273
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,397
And I'm prepared to make my recommendation.

274
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:42,697
Forgive me, but my wife will be excited

275
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,201
to have me tuck the kids
in at least once this week.

276
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:47,503
Certainly, I just...

277
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,444
could you hold off on your
recommendation a few days

278
00:14:52,478 --> 00:14:55,079
so that you can at least have the
dinner you thought you were having?

279
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:57,210
Sure. Pleasure to meet you.

280
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,212
You as well.

281
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,652
Excuse me.

282
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,285
Could I get a splash of whiskey in this?

283
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:15,426
I'll get the bag. You go sit down.

284
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,534
Take a quick look.

285
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:26,836
Then I want to turn off the
lights so you can see the view.

286
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,806
I like what you did with it.

287
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,914
I love it. But my next
house is gonna have a pool.

288
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,716
Our next house.

289
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,321
You sure you don't want to
move into a more populated area?

290
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:44,560
It's like Dracula's castle up here.

291
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,594
They're far away, Don.

292
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,827
It's just what happens to
the sound in the canyon.

293
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,531
I'm scared, but I don't want
to turn the lights back on.

294
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:04,879
I'm a little dizzy. I just... I need
to keep walking just for a second.

295
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:08,047
Oh!

296
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,856
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,761
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.

298
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:26,263
Get some rest.

299
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,308
Don, honey.

300
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:39,379
Please don't flick any
cigarettes off the balcony.

301
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,250
I don't know how, but everyone says

302
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,917
they can tell where the fire starts.

303
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:05,043
Don.

304
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,686
I love my scarf.

305
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,225
I thought with the
convertible, you'd need a few.

306
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,494
It's 9:00 and I have to get to class.

307
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,263
You want me to drop you at the office?

308
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:22,333
No, I'll take a cab.

309
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:25,604
Just don't work all day, okay?

310
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:28,941
And don't rip the ads out of my magazines.

311
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:38,179
Stan, you want coffee?

312
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,919
What are you doing here?

313
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:51,421
I'm just catching up on all
the work that's been going on.

314
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:52,988
Looks good. Lou, he's...

315
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,925
Yes, absolutely.

316
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,094
- So...
- I have a lot to do.

317
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,829
Stan, do you want any coffee?

318
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:03,532
- Yes.
- What?

319
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,502
He said yes.

320
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:06,971
Stan!

321
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:08,739
You don't have to make me any.

322
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:11,476
I'll be out of here in a minute.

323
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:13,511
Hey, Ted. Good to see you.

324
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,312
Hey, Stan.

325
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,283
I thought you'd be tan.

326
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,786
Well, you're in an office
here, you're in an office there.

327
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,054
What's the difference?

328
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,326
You know what? I'm just
going to get my work

329
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,530
and get out of here. Good to see you guys.

330
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:33,910
None of this seems related to coffee.

331
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:40,681
Buck up, chief.

332
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:43,419
I'm fine. It's fine.

333
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:55,472
You look good.

334
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,278
You look wel too.

335
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,287
Iced tea.

336
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,091
You really branched out
into a new environment.

337
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,332
I did discover it in a homesick moment.

338
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,266
I flew back New Year's Eve
after a week with my brother

339
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,368
and Christmas with Tammy and my in-laws.

340
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,537
Sat at the counter by myself

341
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,472
and immediately felt divine.

342
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,571
I'll have a Brooklyn Avenue.

343
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:25,342
It's a pastrami with the
coleslaw right on the sandwich.

344
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,045
Two of those.

345
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,781
Believe it or not, Brooklyn Avenue
is a street in East Los Angeles.

346
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:34,355
The New Yorkers here, they
brought as much as we need.

347
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,693
But the bagels are terrible.

348
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,765
Where are you living?

349
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,267
I have an apartment by the tar pits.

350
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,772
It's one bedroom, but it's two stories.

351
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,541
Must have quite a view.

352
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:50,410
The city is flat and ugly

353
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:53,851
and the air is brown,
but I love the vibrations.

354
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,322
You not only dress like a
hippie, you talk like one.

355
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,993
What have you been up to?

356
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:04,230
Keeping busy. You sign anything out here?

357
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,428
Yeah.

358
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:09,565
The first week I signed
H. Salt Fish and Chips.

359
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,335
Four stores. Didn't Roger
make an announcement?

360
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,103
I wouldn't know.

361
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,942
Oh, of course.

362
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,911
Listen, you know if it was up to me,

363
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,412
you'd be back there already.

364
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:24,311
How's Ted?

365
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:27,480
I noticed you timed it so you'd be
out here while he was back there.

366
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,549
I came to see my wife.

367
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,616
Yes, of course.

368
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,182
I've been meaning to look her up.

369
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:40,029
It's incredible, but he's sour.

370
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,097
Maybe he doesn't like the sun.

371
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:44,169
Last weekend, middle of January,

372
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,507
Sunkist sent us out to the groves

373
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,977
and I picked an orange right off the tree.

374
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:53,248
It's 75. There's snow on the mountains.

375
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:56,317
Ted sat in the car with the
door open writing on a pad.

376
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:00,987
It's good, isn't it?

377
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,955
So although Beverly Hills has
the patina of show business,

378
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,524
it's really just accountants,
lawyers, and dentists.

379
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,595
And you can walk to
lunch, although I don't.

380
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,429
Very nice.

381
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:16,100
So this is the chamber of horrors.

382
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:18,504
And then that's my office.

383
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:24,974
Well. Wonder who that could be.

384
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,349
- Hello there.
- Bonnie Whiteside.

385
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:34,385
This is Don Draper.

386
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,155
Bonnie's a real estate agent.

387
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:38,057
She's helping me find the ideal pad.

388
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:39,390
What, and leave the tar pits?

389
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,723
It's cute, but he shouldn't be renting.

390
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,900
Those are some nice-looking properties.

391
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,602
Where are you living?

392
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:55,806
I told you, honey, Don's bicoastal.

393
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,909
I wanted to be by the ocean, but
my wife rented a house in the hills.

394
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,812
- Great view.
- City or valley?

395
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,312
I don't know.

396
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:07,949
Well, when you're tired of commuting,

397
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:11,485
give me a call.

398
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,620
Don't get excited, Don.

399
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,425
She turns it on for everyone.

400
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,594
Ooh!

401
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,701
Professor Podolsky?

402
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:31,705
Mrs. Harris, I presume?

403
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,941
I appreciate you meeting me on a Saturday.

404
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,843
Well, the price is right

405
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:38,013
and the company looks interesting.

406
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:45,917
What exactly is the company, by the way?

407
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:48,451
The client is in footwear.

408
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,885
Shoes, women's.

409
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,617
The new head of marketing
wants to cut costs.

410
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,786
I get it.

411
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,721
It's 20 degrees out there
and the kids are in sandals.

412
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,089
Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.

413
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:05,055
Is that where you'd start,

414
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,154
keeping in mind "the four Ps"?

415
00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:09,289
Do you have an MBA?

416
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:12,292
No, but their head of marketing does.

417
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:14,194
These kids.

418
00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:17,497
Believe me, Rockefeller didn't
worry about "the four Ps."

419
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,200
Still, I'm going to need an argument

420
00:23:20,235 --> 00:23:23,139
and I think it's going to need
to be more technical than that.

421
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:25,608
I mean, if they're not
quitters, it makes more sense

422
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:28,411
to diversify their lines
or open foreign offices.

423
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:30,946
How much to get an analysis
like that in writing?

424
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,682
Well, let's see if you
have anything to trade.

425
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:38,253
This is a business school.
Doesn't money work here?

426
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:42,126
I'm doing an advertising research study.

427
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,961
I wanted to know what
percentage of your clients

428
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,930
work on fees versus commission.

429
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh.

430
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:53,903
Well, when I started working,

431
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,406
my goodness... 16 years ago,

432
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,176
all of our clients were on commission.

433
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,047
We started discussing a
fee-based model three years ago.

434
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,484
Now we're at 50-50.

435
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:06,852
I don't know if you can answer this,

436
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,587
or even understand it,

437
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:11,485
but what is the difference?

438
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,422
Actually, I can answer that.

439
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,823
You're going to need another pad.

440
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:26,224
Hello.

441
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,927
You frying bacon?

442
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:30,860
It's in the coq au vin.

443
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:33,296
And I made bread pudding with
blueberries in it for dessert.

444
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,498
Any wine left or did
the chicken drink it all?

445
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,401
I picked you up a bottle.

446
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:41,370
Better.

447
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,009
Oh, I think you have the
wrong address. I don't know...

448
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:46,876
Fellas, why don't you put it over there?

449
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,242
Over where? It's huge.

450
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,841
By the window. There's a
wall. That's where it goes.

451
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:04,652
- Thank you very much.
- You've got to sign.

452
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,657
Thank you.

453
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:18,489
Why did you do that?

454
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:20,957
- You have an antenna on the roof?
- It's huge.

455
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:22,791
It's the way they make them now.

456
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,459
How's it gonna look, Don?

457
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,526
You know, everyone I know here is starving.

458
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,992
You're going to be on TV.

459
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,492
Don't you want to watch
yourself in "living color"?

460
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,528
Don't jinx me.

461
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,432
I didn't know an expensive
gift would upset you.

462
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,436
You're not here long enough for a fight.

463
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:46,844
What are you doing up so late?

464
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,810
My mama said to tell
you the toilet's clogged.

465
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,114
Well, she's not supposed
to flush things down it.

466
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:54,946
She'll know what I'm talking about.

467
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,582
My mama said some people
just throw it out the window,

468
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,852
but she's not gonna. You got to fix it.

469
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:02,353
I'm sorry, Julio, but I
just got home from work.

470
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:06,020
It's Saturday. Why you got
to work? You got to fix it!

471
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:08,858
You could ask nicely.
That might work better.

472
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:11,359
- She said to yell at you.
- Why?

473
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:12,992
Because you don't listen.

474
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:15,595
I don't understand her.

475
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,936
Here. This is yours.
It's a gift. Good night.

476
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,966
What is this?

477
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,933
Let's go to bed.

478
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,477
Hey.

479
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:09,213
Yes?

480
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:10,682
We haven't celebrated.

481
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:15,054
Oh, I didn't know if you wanted to.

482
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,458
I do.

483
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:24,329
Let me brush my teeth.

484
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:00,797
Hold on.

485
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,409
Are you okay?

486
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:22,979
I'm just...

487
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:25,649
I don't know why I feel nervous.

488
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:27,252
About this?

489
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:30,254
About everything.

490
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:36,529
Don't.

491
00:29:10,203 --> 00:29:12,171
Good morning.

492
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,078
How much time do we have?

493
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,449
I'm on the red-eye.

494
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:24,322
I hate this.

495
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:27,993
We have the rest of the day.

496
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,297
I know.

497
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:37,540
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.

498
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,459
Hello.

499
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,969
They saved all the construction for Sunday.

500
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,505
It's okay, Daddy. Catch your breath.

501
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,374
It's so good to see you.

502
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:04,545
Sweetheart, being
summoned makes me nervous.

503
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,649
No, everything's wonderful.

504
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:09,618
Can you give us a minute?

505
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:14,789
To the fear of an ambush.

506
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:16,991
To being together.

507
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,530
What the hell are you up to?

508
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,933
I just wanted to see you

509
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:28,801
and tell you that it's been too long

510
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:31,871
and that, well,

511
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:34,007
when all is said and done,

512
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,642
I forgive you.

513
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:38,211
That's beautiful to hear.

514
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:39,846
Because I forgive you, too.

515
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,748
No, Daddy.

516
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,950
I forgive you.

517
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,685
And I forgive you.

518
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:49,925
All of your transgressions...

519
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:53,929
abandoning Mother,

520
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:56,533
making me ask for money,

521
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:59,170
your intermittent interest in Ellery.

522
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:02,040
I don't even care

523
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:04,075
that you smell like incense

524
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:09,546
or have any thoughts about your
current, quote, "state of affairs."

525
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:12,649
I simply forgive you.

526
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:16,617
You want me to say I'm sorry?

527
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:19,921
Because I don't agree with all that.

528
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:21,591
Where the hell is this coming from?

529
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:25,196
Well, if you must know,
I've been searching.

530
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,967
And with a little help,
I've come to understand

531
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:32,203
that anger can be vanquished by love.

532
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:33,773
You going to church?

533
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,045
Not in any way you'd understand.

534
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,016
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing.

535
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,584
You can't make it better.

536
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:46,058
So now we're just supposed
to eat eggs Benedict?

537
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:48,427
I would love that.

538
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,859
Good evening.

539
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,194
Evening.

540
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,060
Thank you.

541
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,967
Do you want a sleeping pill?

542
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:26,169
No, thank you.

543
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:29,270
You know what?

544
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:31,169
Me either.

545
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:35,872
I'm sorry. Don't tell me you enjoy flying.

546
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:38,507
I fly a lot.

547
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,176
And I'm always hoping I was seated next to,

548
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,146
well, someone like you...

549
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:47,081
instead of a man with a
hairpiece eating a banana.

550
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,788
But why would I expect anything else?

551
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:53,722
You can blame Madison Avenue for that.

552
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:56,524
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

553
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,434
Where were you? I was worried.

554
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:07,735
I thought we hated all things domestic.

555
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,970
You sound uptight.

556
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,575
Man walks in, obviously having tied one on,

557
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,412
the woman says, "Where were you?"

558
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,480
Kind of establishment.

559
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,516
Why are you being so mean?

560
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,253
Move over.

561
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:26,190
Oh, Christ. Move him over, too.

562
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:28,093
Is that my vest?

563
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:30,930
If you were with someone, I don't care.

564
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,197
You know anyone's welcome in this bed.

565
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:35,532
I just want to get some sleep.

566
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:58,548
I'd like to put this on,
but vanity is preventing me.

567
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:00,251
You want me to wear
mine so I don't see you?

568
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:10,226
This is nice. I usually sleep alone.

569
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,865
What about the man that gave you that ring?

570
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,671
He passed away.

571
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,544
A year ago, actually.

572
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,947
I was...

573
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:27,386
he wanted his ashes
scattered at Pebble Beach.

574
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:29,991
How was that?

575
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,629
I failed.

576
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:35,798
It's a very popular spot for such things.

577
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,468
Apparently, they don't
want another sand trap.

578
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:42,170
I ended up at his second choice.

579
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,540
Disneyland.

580
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,581
Really?

581
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:50,851
Have you ever been there?

582
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:53,586
I have.

583
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:55,389
Where is he now?

584
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,961
Tom Sawyer Island.

585
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,834
That's probably a popular destination, too.

586
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,374
Yes, they were very vigilant.

587
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,377
It took some doing.

588
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,746
How old was he?

589
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,714
He would have been 50.

590
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,382
So, much older?

591
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,886
He worked fast, too.

592
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,422
What happened to him?

593
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,118
He was thirsty.

594
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:30,789
He died of thirst.

595
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,092
His company sent him to a hospital.

596
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:38,027
I went with him.

597
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:42,896
I was supposed to be
part of the cure somehow.

598
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:49,599
And all I did was observe.

599
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,499
I thought

600
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:54,598
he was really getting better.

601
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:59,200
Then a doctor told me
he'd be dead in a year.

602
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,271
All of them would be.

603
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,425
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

604
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:35,143
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

605
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:38,048
Despite our best efforts,
we're still stacked up,

606
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:40,351
but it looks like we're two away.

607
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,586
I think that we'll begin
our descent in 15 minutes.

608
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:44,723
Sorry, I think I dozed off.

609
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:48,128
You have a few more minutes.

610
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:55,166
If I was your wife, I wouldn't like this.

611
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,471
She knows I'm a terrible husband.

612
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:05,575
How long have you been married?

613
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,112
Not long enough.

614
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,477
I really thought I could do it this time.

615
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:16,814
- Did she kick you out?
- No.

616
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:18,582
She doesn't know that much,

617
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,549
but she knows.

618
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:23,386
Well, if she doesn't know,

619
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,321
you should just keep it that way.

620
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:29,055
That's what people do.

621
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:33,728
I keep wondering...

622
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:38,601
have I broken the vessel?

623
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:43,039
If you did, what can you do about it?

624
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,941
It's done.

625
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,955
I bet I could make you feel better.

626
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:58,959
I bet you could.

627
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:02,129
There's a car waiting for me.

628
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,064
I can give you a lift.

629
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:11,105
I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.

630
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:29,286
Your tenant Mrs. Rodriguez
called again about her toilet.

631
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:31,188
She was hard to understand,
but I think she said

632
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:32,690
she's calling the alderman.

633
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:34,458
Ugh.

634
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:36,294
Call my sister Anita
and tell her to get Gerry

635
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:37,828
and his friend the plumber up there.

636
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:39,297
- Shouldn't I just call Gerry?
- No.

637
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:41,300
Anita can ask her husband, I can't.

638
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,902
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

639
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:45,601
- How was your weekend?
- Peachy.

640
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:48,669
Cut up some firewood.

641
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:51,639
I'm sorry about last week.

642
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:54,506
You' right that I shouldn't have
suggested something I didn't like.

643
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,474
I never gave it another thought.

644
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,008
Well, I did

645
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:02,412
and I realized that Freddy's original idea

646
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:04,114
was the best, but I didn't do it justice.

647
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:06,183
What are you doing? I already said yes.

648
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:08,152
"Accutron,

649
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:11,557
it's not a timepiece,
it's a conversation piece."

650
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:12,993
Forget it.

651
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:18,899
- Morning.
- Morning, Lou.

652
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,732
This is actually a big idea.

653
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,736
Why are you making this so hard?

654
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,273
Open the door and walk in.

655
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:27,541
You do not need to parachute
in through the ceiling.

656
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:30,577
But I don't mind. I just
want to give you my best.

657
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:32,613
I don't know, Peggy.

658
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,649
I guess I'm immune to your charms.

659
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,750
Can I get some coffee?

660
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,121
Good morning, Clara. Is Ken in yet?

661
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:46,657
No, he's on the plane.

662
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,697
As soon as he lands, I need to
speak with him regarding Butler.

663
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,666
Good for you. Mr. Butler
is coming in this week.

664
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,400
What?

665
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,270
Get Wayne Barnes on the line... now.

666
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,947
Mr. Barnes on line three.

667
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:13,388
Joan?

668
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:20,660
- You already set a meeting?
- Good morning.

669
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,566
I took you seriously, but
you didn't take me seriously.

670
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,034
Look, I know you're fighting for
your job, but don't get emotional.

671
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,735
I'm fighting for your job.

672
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:33,241
Okay, well, I appreciate it,

673
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,108
but don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

674
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,242
Are you sure?

675
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:40,445
Let's talk about your
in-house advertising agency.

676
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,683
You think you can go into
a network or a newspaper

677
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:45,352
with your checkbook
and get the space we get

678
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:48,289
when we deal with them
every day with 30 clients?

679
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,458
You will be competing against us,

680
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,293
not against other shoe companies.

681
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:55,263
We both know the shoe
business is going to decline

682
00:40:55,298 --> 00:40:56,565
for some time in the future.

683
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,467
If you make a bold move now,

684
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,936
that decline will be your responsibility.

685
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:03,206
What are you gonna do then?

686
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,409
You can only fire us once.

687
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:07,545
So what am I supposed to do?

688
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,914
I already set the meeting.

689
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,083
Cancel it.

690
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:13,285
No, I'm asking you,

691
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,653
what do I do?

692
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,426
Tell them we cancelled the meeting.

693
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,299
We need more time to present
a revised media strategy.

694
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,139
- Yes.
- Good.

695
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:31,274
I'm still expecting to meet with Ken.

696
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,742
I'll follow up on that today.

697
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:34,910
You'd better.

698
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,614
Did you tell him to prepare
more boards for Accutron?

699
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:48,783
- Do you want to do it?
- No, I want to do it.

700
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:51,719
- I don't know what I did.
- Get out of here.

701
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:54,157
He may be in the art
department, but he reports to me.

702
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:56,561
We already have boards
for "Accutron is accurate."

703
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:58,231
You know that's a loser.

704
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,968
I think if he could see both
of them, he'll change his mind.

705
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:03,039
Or at least let us show both to the client.

706
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:05,273
Let it go, baby. It's dead.

707
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,606
No, I just don't think he's
given it the proper thought.

708
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,909
You're telling your boss
you think he's stupid.

709
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,947
Well, I'm tired of fighting
for everything to be better.

710
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,182
You're all a bunch of hacks who
are perfectly happy with shit.

711
00:42:14,216 --> 00:42:16,149
Nobody cares about anything.

712
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,551
No one wants things to be better, I got it.

713
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:21,087
I'll just stand out here all by myself.

714
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,162
We find ourselves rich in goods,

715
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,832
but ragged in spirit...

716
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:33,069
reaching with magnificent
precision for the moon,

717
00:42:33,104 --> 00:42:36,039
but falling into raucous discord on Earth.

718
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:38,576
We are caught in war wanting peace.

719
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:40,913
We're torn by division wanting unity.

720
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:44,384
We see around us empty
lives wanting fulfillment.

721
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,521
We see tasks that need doing...

722
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:49,188
- Come in.
- ... waiting for hands to do them.

723
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:55,197
You know I'm breaking a rule here.

724
00:42:55,232 --> 00:42:57,632
I haven't had one of these
sausages since I quit.

725
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:01,172
If this makes me have dreams about
beer, I'm gonna be mad at you.

726
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:06,808
Oh, no, no. Come on.

727
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:09,012
I should be paying you.

728
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:12,450
You want that balcony door
open? It's freezing outside.

729
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:20,291
Peggy went bananas for your Accutron work.

730
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:22,628
Of course she lifted her leg on it.

731
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:25,797
Also, I swang by J. Walter Thompson,

732
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:27,930
thinking there was an emergency
with our copy for 7-Up.

733
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:30,329
- You want a sweater?
- Nah.

734
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:34,263
Turns out they're looking
for help on Oscar Mayer.

735
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:37,966
You are making quite a
name for me out there.

736
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,671
Bologna? Hot dogs? It's
moms and kids either way.

737
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,440
Why don't you stop this Cyrano bit

738
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,542
and march your ass in
there and get us both a job?

739
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,244
Because I have a job.

740
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:50,110
It's been two months.

741
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:51,880
Nobody's called, right?

742
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:53,482
Still being paid.

743
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:55,817
Well, they had Christmas without you.

744
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:58,388
The Super Bowl. Pretty
soon it's gonna be Easter.

745
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,691
You know, I've been there.

746
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,759
You don't want to be damaged goods.

747
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:15,867
I tried to get a hold of you.

748
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:18,604
Why? I spoke to Clara. Thank
you for solving that problem.

749
00:44:18,638 --> 00:44:21,471
I bailed it out, but I
think it's irreparable.

750
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:23,604
It's only a matter of
time before we lose it.

751
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:26,606
Every account man who's ever
come into my office has said that.

752
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:28,273
But they haven't all left one of these.

753
00:44:29,307 --> 00:44:31,908
- Oh.
- Stay out of my office.

754
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:50,259
Sorry.

755
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:51,928
I dozed off.

756
00:44:51,963 --> 00:44:54,866
Well, Jimmy says he'll
be back in the morning.

757
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,336
He needed a part.

758
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,540
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

759
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:02,674
It seems silly for you to go all the
way out to Brooklyn and come back.

760
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:05,044
It won't take long this time of night.

761
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:09,217
Are you sure?

762
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,819
I don't like Anita
there alone in the house.

763
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,758
Of course.

764
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,294
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.
