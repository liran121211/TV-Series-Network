You're acting crazy!

6
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:11,436
As usual, you have
acted impulsively!

7
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:15,369
Most of your questionable
behaviour is beyond explanation.

8
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:19,122
You are not allowed to be
alone with clients.

9
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:21,936
You are to stick
to the script in meetings.

10
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,512
And you will report to Lou.

11
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:26,337
I thought we had an
understanding about Don.

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,228
There's nothing

your request

- that I am, too.
- Thank you.

- What is "it"?
- What, am I Cassandra?

39
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,255
That machine came for us.

Where did you get this?

45

I found it on
the Xerox machine.

46
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:57,343
And I thought,
"Wow, Shirley's gonna be

47
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,110
in a lot of trouble
for leaving it there."

48
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,577
- It's sensational stuff.
- I didn't leave it there.

49
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:03,944
But I appreciate its return.

50
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:05,745
It's got to be pretty recent.

51
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,512
He's got one about
Eisenhower's funeral.

52
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:11,014
I'm sure he'd prefer
you hadn't seen this.

53

Hmm, that's not
what Dr. Freud would say.

54

Hello, Stephanie.
It's Don.

About the same.

Well...

76
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:14,116
I suppose it probably sounds
like an emergency,

77
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,886
but it's not. I thought
of you because, well--

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,588
it's not an emergency.

79
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,724

I don't know why I said that.

89
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,915
No, that's what you are.

90
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,281
I like that.

91

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,187

Yes.

He doesn't eat the
burgers, he cooks them.

But what if you replaced
him with a fresh recruit?

A saucy little retard
named Scout.

141

He can't work

- Mort Walker.
- How'd you get this?

153
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:39,107
It wasn't our fault. Why is
Scout always up to no good?

154
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,875
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.

155

- Thought they were potatoes.
- ( laughing )

156
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,745
I'm gonna get rid of this.

157
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,782
He left it on the Xerox. He
obviously wanted us to have a copy.

158
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,951
You're just gonna
force me to draw my own.

Get to work.

stroke to 'em later.

and little franks
in barbecue sauce.

167

You know they've got four more
houses to visit after us?

I wanted to go first
to put everyone at ease.

169
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,153
They get so
tongue-tied around us.

170
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:27,259
They can only pretend so long
we're just "regular neighbors."

171
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,397
Could you stock the bar?

00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,189
You are so beautiful.

178
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,857
I know, I'm a Madonna.

179
00:08:57,126 --> 00:09:01,096
But you are truly magnetic.

180
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:02,364
What do you do?

181
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,167
Don didn't tell you?
I'm an actress.

182
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,106
Uh, welcome.

183
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,409
I'm grateful.

184
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,409
For some reason,
I'm not crying, man.

185
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,313
Well, why don't I fix
you something to eat

186
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,215
and then you can take
a shower if you want?

187
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,615
- Is it that bad?
- No!

188
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,451
I don't know.

189
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:23,156
I think you'd want to relax.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,126
Don didn't say much about your
situation other than the obvious.

191
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:29,196
Your place is out of sight.

192
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,565
I'm at a flop
in MacArthur Park,

193
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,170
but I'm headed up to Oakland
with a little help.

194
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,706
I have some friends there and one
of them's old man's a doctor.

195
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,408
So, assume
it's no trouble at all.

196
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,508
What's your pleasure?
Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?

197
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:46,113
Do you have any meat?
I've been dreaming about it.

198
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,051
( laughs )
Sure.

199
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,619
Now you go into the bedroom
back there.

200
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,588
I changed the sheets.
There are towels.

201
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,687
You can lie down, run a bath,

202
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,490
whatever you want.
Make yourself at home.

203
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,959
Thank you.
I'm pretty beat.

204
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,375
You know I want her.

205
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,411
You can't have her.

206
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,078
Why can't I have her?

207
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,479
Because Scout's on 'er.

208
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:22,015
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

209
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,373
Nice of you to join us.

210
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,516
Don, why don't you take the
mound, throw out the first pitch?

211
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,315
Sure.

212
00:10:56,349 --> 00:11:00,354
Stan has some
very preliminary work.

213
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:02,422
Stan?

214
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:05,592
Should I move over there or do
you want to come over here?

215
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,894
I don't know, Stan. Can you
be smug from over there?

216
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,464
Lou, I don't know
what you think you heard.

217
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,266
I heard everything!

218
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,371
From your first fart
to your last dying breath.

219
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,006
- ( chuckles )
- You think it's funny?

220
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,442
I apologize deeply.

221
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,378
What happened?

222
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:25,345
Let me ask you, Peggy.

223
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,545
- You ever heard of Underdog?
- The cartoon?

224
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,714
Yeah.
Sweet Polly Purebred.

225
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,183
Saturday morning.

226
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,119
It makes hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year.

227
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:36,555
Mostly for its creator Chet
Stover of Dancer Fitzgerald.

228
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,225
- Did you know him there?
- He was nothing special.

229
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,794
"Scout's Honor"
is 100 times better.

230
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:45,025
I can tell you right now,
it's a winner.

231
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:49,695
You know who had a ridiculous
dream and people laughed at him?

232
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:53,127
- You?
- ( laughs )

233
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,829
What?

234
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,533
Oh, I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

235
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,070
I mean, if you're telling us
that this is your dream,

236
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:04,271
I apologize for being one
of those naysaying idiots.

237
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,739
I hate people like that.

238
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,476
Bob Dylan.

239
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,214
Is he hip enough for you?

240
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,549
He was 20 years old when he
wrote "Blowin' in the Wind"

241
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,617
and he's a genius.

242
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,985
Look at where he is,
look at where you are.

243
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,788
( stifled laugh )

244
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,491
You know what?

245
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,026
You're a bunch of
flag-burning snots.

246
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,428
You've got a thing to learn
about patriotism and loyalty.

247
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,534
The very fabric of "Scout's
Honor" is a joke to you.

248
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,636
We're gonna have
this meeting later.

249
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,775
So order dinner because
I want finished work.

250
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,478
And if any of you
don't like it,

251
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,012
you can thank your
hilarious friends here.

252
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,431
Last flight's at 9:00.
Put me on that.

253
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:04,066
- I'll cancel my plans.
- Just mine, not yours.

254
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,300
I don't know if it's vandals

255
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,236
or just kids being kids.

256
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,804
What is it?

257
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,340
Someone broke all the
streetlights on Peck Avenue.

258
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,040
And you want Henry
to get them fixed?

259
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,109
No. Mike was just saying
it's a national disease.

260
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,077
The wildness of the kids.

261
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,945
I just don't expect it
in Westchester.

262
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,114
I know all everyone wants
to talk about is Vietnam,

263
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:28,384
but things are
falling apart here, too.

264
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:30,451
The rumaki is exquisite.

265
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:32,452
Thank you.

266
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,324
Well, I don't know, that
those things are unrelated.

267
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,159
I mean, first the kids
start off protesting

268
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,197
and the next thing you know every
authority is up for grabs.

269
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,933
I mean, if they learned
how to support their country,

270
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,967
sacrifice in hard times, we'd
have the morale to win the war.

271
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,804
Mike, you have plans
for the summer?

272
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,509
Even Nixon wants to bring
the war to an end.

273
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,344
I'm surprised, Henry.

274
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,747
Don't be, Mike.
I agree with Nixon.

275
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,948
I think it's too costly.

276
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:00,717
It has to be done
on the right terms,

277
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,652
but I think we should get out
while the getting's good.

278
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,352
Since when?

279
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,854
I've always supported
the president, honey.

280
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,331
I think that maybe everyone
should fill up here.

281
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,701
I don't know
if my lamb turned out.

282
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,636
I'm sure it's delicious.

283
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,771
Let me check the Sterno.

284
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,576
( knocks )

285
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,115
Well, I think I worked
every side of the strategy.

286
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,657
Don, you've been the boss.

287
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:36,994
The briefcase and the hat,
that's a rookie maneuver.

288
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,696
You got someplace to be?

289
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,029
I'm afraid I do.

290
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,233
How's it going to look
for them if I let you go?

291
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,835
Well, you could let
everybody go.

292
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,337
Is that what you would do?

293
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,074
No, I'd let<i> you</i> go, Lou.

294
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,145
Well, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

295
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,314
I'm gonna do you the
courtesy of reading these

296
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:59,650
so that you can continue to work on them
instead of coming up with new things,

297
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,153
because I'm gonna
tuck you in tonight.

298
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,658
About your cartoon.

299
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,626
Here we go.

300
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,828
This is an office made out of people
who have problems with authority.

301
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:15,597
You know you have to have a thick
skin, but don't help them.

302
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:19,067
I'm not taking management
advice from Don Draper.

303
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,174
( phone ringing )

304
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,780
Hello.

305
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,848
I can't get out
of here tonight.

306
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,153
- Is she there yet?
- She's taking a bath.

308
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,389
How is she?

309
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,158
She's pretty far along.

310
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,963
So beautiful.

311
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:46,335
Well, don't bother her. Tell her
I'll see her in the morning.

312
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,374
Don't worry.
I made her a steak.

313
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,075
Thank you.

314
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,444
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

315
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,813
Okay.

316
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,850
Damn, that smells good.

317
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,089
Don's stuck in New York. He's
flying in tomorrow morning.

318
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:08,324
Was that him?

319
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,029
Yeah, he's frustrated.
I told him not to worry.

320
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,268
Wait, do you want
to eat outside?

321
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,636
I do that all the time.

322
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,739
I love that you're
wearing Anna's ring.

323
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,244
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.

324
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,514
I'm sorry I never met her.

325
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:30,750
She's around.
Believe me, you've met her.

326
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,920
She's happy it's in the family.

327
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:36,155
Well, maybe you'll have
someone there to give it to.

328
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,123
Oh, no.
It's yours now

329
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,825
You'll probably have
someone of your own.

330
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,731
We'll see.
I don't know.

331
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:45,468
Don's kids are plenty for me.

332
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,371
( sighs )

333
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,307
I haven't eaten meat in a year.

334
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,276
I don't think
this is a good idea.

335
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,142
I can make spaghetti.

336
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:57,446
It's probably hard
with you here and him there.

337
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,850
Are you with someone?

338
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:04,052
Not right now.
He was a musician.

339
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:05,687
They're the worst.

340
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,860
Dropped out of school.
Followed him down here.

341
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,962
Started flush at the beach,

342
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,632
ended up downtown panhandling.

343
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,506
And then he got busted
dealing grass

344
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,275
and we celebrated
before he went away.

345
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,611
He'll be out in a month.

346
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:24,549
So will this little guy.

347
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,217
Does he know?

348
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,585
No.

349
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,953
I'm afraid he'd murder
someone just to stay in jail.

350
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,889
- I won't tell Don.
- Oh, I don't care.

351
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,624
I know all of his secrets.

352
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:44,899
But you don't
know<i> him</i> very well.

353
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,633
You're right.
You're right.

354
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,503
It's just I'm looking at you

355
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,504
and seeing how, well,
disorganized this all is.

356
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,105
And I don't think
he'd stand for that.

357
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,543
I don't think he'd trust you
to make your own plans.

358
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,349
I don't know what I'm doing here.
This is a dumb idea.

359
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,587
No, no, I mean,
he wants to help,

360
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,521
I'm sure, in his way.
We both do.

361
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,033
I'm going to give you...

362
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,671
would $1,000
get you far enough?

363
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,507
That's very generous.

364
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,009
This comes with no strings.

365
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,676
Thank you.

366
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,883
I really think
it's better this way.

367
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,054
You're right.
I'm gonna take off.

368
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,589
You haven't eaten anything yet.

369
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,723
I guess I got what I came for.

370
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,359
There's no rush.

371
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,701
Nothing ever happened
between us, you know.

372
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,904
Of course not.

373
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,938
You're his niece.
I know that.

374

376

- What about your headache?
- Keep your voice down.

377
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,473
I did not appreciate going stag

378
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:28,109
to four people's homes
whom I barely know.

379
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:31,448
I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well.
You didn't have to go.

380
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,784
Hey, "Emily Post."

381
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:36,785
Why were you
talking about the war?

382
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,617
I didn't bring it up.

383
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,851
But maybe I should more because
I didn't know where you stood.

384
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,253
I shouldn't have to brief you

385
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:44,622
because you shouldn't be
talking about those things.

386
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,390
I'm not a dinner companion.

387
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:47,791
I'm their elected
representative.

388
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:50,492
- You ran unopposed.
- We'll see if that lasts.

389
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,593
From now on, keep your
conversation to how much you hate

390
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:55,529
getting toast crumbs in the butter
and leave the thinking to me.

391
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:01,201
Henry!

392
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:03,338
I'm sorry. It just
caught me off-guard.

393
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:06,475
Well, you embarrassed
yourself way more than me.

00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,289
I decided I can
see that Monday.

- Who are you?
- I'm Amy.

406

- We met on the phone.
- Is Megan here?

407
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,198
Oh, Don.
I...

408

Amy, do you mind?

409

I'll just use the ladies'.

410
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:23,775
I'm sorry, but she left.

411
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,880
You told her
I wanted to see her?

412
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,517
I really tried
to get her to stay.

413
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,819
But the money already came up

414
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,551
and I gave her $1,000.

415
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:33,520
She must have been embarrassed.

416
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:35,722
She said she'd call
you from Oakland.

417
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:38,158
You should have called me.
At least let me talk to her.

418
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,262
She's an adult, Don.

419
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,601
Do you want to go
to the market with us?

420
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,669
You know, I'm gonna
have company tonight.

421
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,337
Maybe it'll cheer you up.

422

We'll go.
Amy.

423
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:00,579
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

424

- We should go.
- Anything for you, Don?

- Girls! Girls! Please.

Sally, you can understand how your mother
and I are both worried about your nose.

444
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:48,790
Yeah, I know, because where would
Mom be without her perfect nose?

445
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:50,794
She wouldn't find
a man like you.

446
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,697
She'd be nothing.

447
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,000
It<i> was</i> a perfect nose.

448
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,766
And<i> I</i> gave it to you.

449
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,770

00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,806
to get Dr. Kramer
to fix it this weekend.

451
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,376
I suppose you'd rather do
it in a barn in Farmington.

452
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,745
It's a nose job,
not an abortion.

- I'm going to break your arm next.
- Betty!

00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:06,354
Don. Megan.

526
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,895
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,696
Miranda here
invited me to a party.

528
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,965
I didn't know this was it.

529
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,401
Hi, Miranda.

530
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:16,201
This place is out of sight.

531
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:18,570
I've been trying to help
Miranda find an agent.

532
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:20,207
You're so helpful.

533
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:24,210
Harry, what do you say
we go get a drink?

534
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:29,016
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

535
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:30,719
As long as Harry drives.

536
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:33,958
Well, I-- We--

537
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:37,028
Should I bring Miranda along?

538
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:38,697
Do you want to?

539
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,268
Sorry, honey.

540
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:46,138
We'll get you a ride.

541
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:58,052
She better not
catch you in here.

542
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,221
But then I'm not
gonna get to see you.

543
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:03,091
That's the way Betty likes it.

544
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,198
Are they gonna get divorced?

545
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,866
What? No.

546
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,368
They're the Dynamic Duo.

547
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:12,669
That's never going to happen.

548
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:16,206
The other night, they were
really screaming at each other.

549
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
I saw Henry take
a pillow to the den.

550
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:21,978
I'm gonna hitch
back to school tonight.

551
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,547
Can I come with you?

552
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,480
You want to run away?

553
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,185
I have a stomach ache
all the time.

554
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:37,026
You're not gonna piss, are you?

555
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,629
I don't do that anymore.

556
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,269
I'm sorry.

557
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:46,739
They'll never let you out.

558
00:30:46,774 --> 00:30:49,975
You're too little.

559
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,258
- Michael.
- I'm sorry.

560
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,325
The kid left an hour ago.

561
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,459
It's interesting because
first you were dead,

562
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:08,996
then all this activity
started in your eyelids.

563
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,765
Time to go.

564
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,999
There's this pressure
in my head

565
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,467
like there's a hydrogen
bomb that's gonna go off.

566
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:19,472
And then I realize
it's that hum in the office.

567
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:21,242
It's getting to me.

568
00:31:21,277 --> 00:31:22,809
I caught myself looking
at Stan's shoulders

569
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:25,208
and getting, you know, excited.

570
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:28,342
- Really?
- That's the computer's plan.

571
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:30,245
Turn us all homo.

572
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,479
Peggy, we got to reproduce.

573
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:37,214
If there was a way to do it
without having sex, I'd do it.

574
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,583
Stop it!

575
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:41,049
You have to leave.

576
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:44,218
Great. What am I doing?
It's building up.

577
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:46,086
Well, maybe you should
see a doctor or something.

578
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Why?
'Cause I want you?

579
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:50,054
No, because you're not right.

580
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,590
Did you notice the radio
doesn't work in there anymore?

581
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,393
That's not my imagination.

582
00:31:54,427 --> 00:31:56,226
It's just a computer!

583
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,037
No, you're right.

584

I'm gonna go.

585

You don't have to report
this information.

Do you not want to talk?

590
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,534

so happy to see me.

But guys like us, we've got
to look out for each other.

You wouldn't do that.

604

We go back a long way,

605
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:24,388
We do.

It's gonna take some thought.

610
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:36,408
It's gonna take
some major brain power.

611
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,978
In fact, you might
have to figure it out.

612
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:43,016
I think the solution here
is not to get rid of you.

613
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,286
You should be in LA.

614

Oh, this is the final solution.

619
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:03,828
Cutler and Lou

Commander who?

621
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:07,563
No, Commander cigarettes.

622
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,233
Philip Morris.

623
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,435
I think they're pretty sure
that they can land it

624
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,969

625
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:18,237

Is there work?

Don't make me sorry I told you.

I hope you know how much
I appreciate this.

So far, just phone calls.

You know what would
make you feel better?

Drugs.

I don't want you
to be in a bad mood.

00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:41,281
I'm comfortable here right now.

707
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:45,053
I just drove to White Plains
and back up to Farmington.

708
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:46,820
I don't want to sit
in the kitchen like the help.

709
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:48,487
"The help"?

710
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:50,623
I'm going to assume
you're not referring to me.

711
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,022
What's gotten into you?

712
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:53,723
You come in and ask me to move

713
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:55,690
just because you feel
like moving.

714
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:59,023
I'm comfortable in here or I
wouldn't be sitting in here.

715
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:02,593
- Knock it off. - I'm tired of
everyone telling me to shut up.

716
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,764
I'm not stupid.

717
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,399
I speak Italian.

718
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,871
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

719
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:13,444
You're sorry you forgot to inform
me what I'm supposed to think.

720
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:16,411
Guess what?
I think all by myself.

721
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:19,314
You're so smart. Why don't
<i>you</i> run for office?

722
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:21,285
Know what, Henry? I don't
know what I'm going to do,

723
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,521
but that's a good idea.

724
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:25,723
( sighs )

725
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:33,133
( knocks )

726
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:35,203
Good morning, Michael.

727
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:36,939
How are you?

728
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:42,380
Can't you tell?
I'm myself again.

729
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:45,514
Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear that.

730
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:48,587
But I do want to say
in the clearness of day,

731
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,124
I have feelings for you.

732
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:52,427
Well, I'm flattered,

733
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:56,698
and that happens
when you work with people.

734
00:41:56,732 --> 00:41:59,033
But it's not real.

735
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:01,366
I realized it was
the waves of data.

736
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,833
They were filling me up.
I had to find the release.

737
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:05,901
I removed the pressure.

738
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:08,035
Now it just flows through me
without affecting me at all.

739
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,969
It has an outlet.
Open it.

740
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:14,841
You don't have to
thank me for that.

741
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:17,439
It's obviously something
you did on your own.

742
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:22,811
( screams )
What is that?

743
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:25,812
It's my nipple.
It's the valve.

744
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:29,251
It's weird.
They'll sew it up,

745
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:32,188
but they won't take it off.
I had to do that myself.

746
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,590
Anyway, I'm grateful,
so I wanted to show it.

747
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:48,354
Michael, sit down.

748
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,927
I want you to wait here.

749
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:11,906
Did Mr. Ginsberg
find you?

750
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,813
<i>( "Savoy" playing )</i>

751
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:40,634
Jim, Lou.
Sorry to interrupt.

752
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,839
You must be Les.
Don Draper.

753
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,642
Don.

754
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:49,709
This is Stephen and Tony.

755
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:51,277
We weren't expecting you, Don.

756
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:53,680
I know that and I apologize.

757
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,047
I just wanted to say
something that I think

758
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,984
these gentlemen from Philip
Morris are too polite to say.

759
00:43:59,018 --> 00:44:00,820
We know who you are

760
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:03,756
and we're only talking
about a presentation right now.

761
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,593
But we do have
a problem working

762
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,162
with the man who cut our throat
in "The New York Times."

763
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:15,006
Well, if you were
to give us a shot,

764
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,207
I'm prepared
to leave the agency.

765
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:23,281
Don, thanks for saying that
so that we don't have to.

766
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:26,215
Just know the man
who wrote that letter

767
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,917
was trying to save his
business, not destroy yours.

768
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:32,652
Like Lou, I have over 10 years

769
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:34,921
of tobacco experience.

770
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:36,788
Since my first day
on Lucky Strike,

771
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:39,024
the government
was building a scaffold

772
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:40,860
for your whole industry.

773
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:42,661
And I found a way
to stay that execution

774
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:46,835
in '60, '62, '64, and '65.

775
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:53,381
I'm also the only cigarette man
who sat down with the opposition.

776
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,421
They shared
their strategy with me

777
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,792
and I know how to beat it.

778
00:44:59,826 --> 00:45:02,497
That may be true,

779
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:05,100
but we don't turn on our
friends as easily as you do.

780
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,774
I just keep thinking
what your friends

781
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,908
at American Tobacco would think

782
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,814
if you made me apologize.

783
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,188
Force me into your service.

784
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:21,759
They are still your
competition, aren't they?

785
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,669
Gentlemen, thank you
for your time.

786
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:42,386
Get out while you can!

787
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,062
I'm gonna ride down with him.
