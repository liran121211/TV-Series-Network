You know what? Why don't
you swing down to Irvine?

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,227
We have a lot more
groves down there.

17
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,263
Passenger #2:
Can we go to Tijuana?

18
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,365
I'm tired at looking
at oranges.

19
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:20,101
Ted: There's more to
look at than the ground.

20
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:22,403
Imagine what it's like
for the astronauts.

21
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,739
They're probably scared.

22
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:27,676
Why? Maybe they won't make it.

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,877
All their problems
will be over.

24
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:32,180
You know how to fly this thing?

25
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:34,715
<i>( engine stops )</i>

26
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:36,050
What are you doing?

27
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:39,920
See that spot along 66?
Probably Claremont.

28
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:41,889
Good spot for
smoldering wreckage.

29
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:44,792
- It's not funny.
- Turn it back on this minute!

30
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,695
You wanted to go up in the
plane, we went up in the plane.

31
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,363
- My God, we're gonna die!
- ( groaning )

32
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,233
Well, I thought I'd talk
to you privately first,

33
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:56,103
because your next call is going
to be from Pete Campbell.

34
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,571
Have him call me.

35
00:01:58,105 --> 00:01:59,706
I'd love to hear
his version of it.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,274
Well, Pete says that Sunkist
called him distraught.

37
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,010
( silent )

38
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,445
Severely distraught because
apparently you cut the engines

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,648
and scared them half to death.

40
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:11,283
And also expressed a real
feeling of wanting to die.

41
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,052
He used to fly.
Didn't you ever feel that?

42
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,688
Over Dresden?
I wanted to <i>live.</i>

43
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,623
( yelling ) And the clients
want to live, too, Ted!

44
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,193
I thought this was private.

45
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,164
He's leaving.

46
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:28,166
Look, Jim, I don't want to die.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,201
I just don't wanna
do this anymore.

48
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:33,604
- Do what?
- Advertising.

49
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,840
I wanna do something else.
Somewhere else.

50
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,375
- I don't think that's possible.
- <i>Sure, it is.</i>

51
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,811
You're gonna buy me out.

52
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,512
Ted, you don't know
what you're saying.

53
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,748
I've made up my mind.
Goodbye.

54

55
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,589
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Madeline: <i>Mr. Avery's here.</i>

56
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,424
Send him in.

57
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:57,794
Just wanted to say
Commander cigarettes is dead.

58
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,431
Leo Burnett says they're rolling it
up with the rest of Philip Morris.

59
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,433
Oh, well, that's too bad.

60
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,535
But I suppose now people will know
we're in the tobacco business again.

61
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,337
- And that's good.
- Oh, sure.

62
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:09,339
There's a cork-tipped
Newport in the works.

63
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,508
Shall I invite them to "Don
Draper Dinner Theater"?

64
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,610
Maybe a matinee?

65
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,712
10 years I've built
a tobacco resume

66
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,014
and one meeting
turned me into a joke.

67
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:22,685
I'm gonna crawl outta this place
with nothing left to show.

68
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,420
We don't owe you anything.

69
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,989
You're a hired hand!
Now get back to work.

70
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,229
- <i>( door closes )</i>
- ( huffs )

71
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,434
Bobby! Sally! Get down here!
You're being rude!

72
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,768
But I know I put it in the car.

73
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,870
Neil, that's enough.

74
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,571
"The case of the
missing telescope."

75
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,840
Neil can bunk with Bobby,

76
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,609
and there's a daybed in
the sewing room for Sean.

77
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:53,715
Sean, Neil.
This is Bobby and Sally.

78
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,149
Where's your little brother?

79
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,351
My goodness, Sally.

80
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:58,219
You look like your
mother freshman year.

81
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:00,621
Carolyn, you're the one
with the fully grown men.

82
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:03,624
- You have such a lovely home.
- Where are we supposed to put these?

83
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:05,626
I'll show you.

84
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,295
Don't let the lady carry a bag.

85
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,097
Oh, it's fine.
I'm strong.

86
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:11,365
Let me get it.

87
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,002
Follow me, Rick.

88
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,607
Bobby, show Neil
your telescope.

89
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,609
It'll give you an excuse
to take it out of the box.

90
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,211
You can't see anything
during the daytime.

91
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,046
That's not true.

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,914
( sighs )
Come on.

93
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,186
Of course, now that my
partnership is on the table,

94
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,687
Jennifer has stopped
talking about divorce.

95
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,756
She's postponing
the conversation.

96
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,658
Yeah, till after
I get that money.

97
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,759
Don, can you be impartial?
What do I hold out for?

98
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:44,429
Don't negotiate,
just accept the deal.

99
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,196
Should we take it from the top?

100
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,200
"Welcome, welcome.

101
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,403
Indiana's beautiful
this time of year."

102
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,372
I tell a joke, everyone laughs.

103
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,274
Then Harry gets up and doesn't squander
the good will I've just generated.

104
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:00,210
- I have a joke, too.
- No, you don't.

105
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,846
"Local buy, national buy,
outdoor."

106
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,648
I tell them about
the IBM 360, but...

107
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,886
I don't show them a picture, because
we only show pictures of ads.

108
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,653
Peggy.

109
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:14,824
We were scared until we knew the
genuine superiority of Burger Chef.

110
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,326
More general flattery,
research, research.

111
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,629
"Without further ado,
Donald Draper." Don?

112
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,230
Is that what you're
going to say?

113
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,899
Don't worry about what
she's going to say.

114
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,666
I was going to say that...

115
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,635
"Every great ad is a story,

116
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,104
and here to tell you that story

117
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:30,306
is our creative director
and partner,

118
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,941
Donald Draper."

119
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,511
Don?

120
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:39,648
( sighs )

121
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,950
"I don't know
about your dinner table,

122
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:43,518
but I know about mine.

123
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,454
- When I get home--"
- That's fine.

124
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,957
Now we just have to pray everything
goes smoothly on the moon.

125
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,899
Hello?

126
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,068
Oh, I'm sorry.

127
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:03,037
Where's Kazmir?

128
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,905
He had to run downtown.

129
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,974
Oh.

130
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,043
Well, it looks like
you're doing a good job.

131
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,611
Once you get the grid up,

132
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,080
you just try not
to break the tiles.

133
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,215
I'm Peggy, by the way.

134
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,452
( exhales )
I'm Nick.

135
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,887
You've got a lot of books.

136
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,589
It's so hot in here.

137
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,457
Would you like some iced tea?

138
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:27,392
Kaz should give you a discount,
your son was a big help.

139
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,428
My son?

140
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:32,331
Oh, Julio? No, he's my neighbor.

141
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,699
I own the building.

142
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,335
By yourself?

143
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,871
<i>( TV playing )</i>

144
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,007
I was <i>very</i> clear I am not
paying before it's finished.

145
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,110
That's my number.

146
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,279
In case you have any
odd jobs too small for Kaz.

147
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:51,483
Well, thank you.

148
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,887
- Good night.
- Good night.

149
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,722
Good night, kid.

150
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:07,063
Can I have a Popsicle?
I only had one today.

151
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:08,999
Sure.

152
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:17,340
So then Rutgers promised him a
generous athletic scholarship.

153
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,410
It was nice he had choices,

154
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,578
but I don't see any passion.

155
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:24,180
I don't remember dreaming of
anything but Paris at his age.

156
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:26,383
Paris and Ty Power.

157
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,884
How did I marry Rick?

158
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,453
- He has no eyelashes.
- ( laughing )

159
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,188
So...

160
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,825
I have to ask.
Do you ever see Don?

161
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,227
Only when absolutely necessary.

162
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:41,564
I'm starting to think of him
as an old, bad boyfriend.

163
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,134
Someone a teenage
anthropologist would marry.

164
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:49,538
- Is there any oatmeal?
- Carolyn: Good morning, mister.

165
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,172
Good morning,
Mrs. Francis.

166
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,274
Betty.

167
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,677
Go get decent.

168
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,647
- Hey, sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm late.

169
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,248
What can I get you?

170
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:02,616
She gets to eat
in a bathing suit?

171
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,086
- 'Cause I swim in these shorts.
- I can't eat anything

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,588
because I'm a lifeguard
and I can't wait an hour.

173
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:08,856
Go.

174
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,464
Bye, everyone.

175
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,837
She is so beautiful.

176
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,872
Particularly today.

177
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:29,208
She's never worn lipstick
to the pool before.

178
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,510
Because before they reach
the surface of the moon,

179
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,811
they're gonna
throw down an anchor.

180
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,480
And what if <i>that</i>
sinks right into it?

181
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,882
Hmm? What if
it's quicksand?

182
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,818
- Am I late for something?
- No.

183
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,654
May I speak with you?

184
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,334
What's going on?

185
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:00,369
You got this letter
this morning

186
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:03,807
and it's very upsetting news.

187
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,245
Are they firing you?

188
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,582
I don't know.

189
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:17,153
What does that mean,
"breach of contract"?

190
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:18,821
This is from
the agency's attorney.

191
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:20,155
Why didn't they call me?

192
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,957
Look at you.

193
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:26,361
You're so confused.

194
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:29,163
You never even met
with Commander cigarettes.

195
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,399
I would have known.
( sniffles )

196
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,937
- It doesn't matter.
- ( sniffling )

197
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:42,543
I want you to listen to me.

198
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:47,748
I know you're
feeling vulnerable,

199
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:50,684
but I am your strength.

200
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:03,063
Tell me what I can do.

201
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:06,667
You can get my
attorney on the phone.

202
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,668
And we can't do this.

203
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,039
You're right.

204
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,908
Not right now.

205
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,786
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

206
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:33,023
You think you're gonna throw
me out of my own company?

207
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,125
Madeline, I've got it.

208
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,261
Todd, could you excuse us?

209
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,497
Don has a habit
of walking into meetings

210
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:41,131
unannounced.

211
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,535
- Should I reschedule?
- Get out!

212
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,104
It was cut and dry.
You broke the stipulations

213
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:48,505
of the addendum
to your contract.

214
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,407
You set that meeting to
force me out of the agency.

215
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,309
What was I supposed to do?

216
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,878
You know, Ted and I,

217
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,380
whenever we would hear that
your agency was involved,

218
00:10:58,415 --> 00:11:00,883
we'd always be so intimidated.

219
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,418
"What was that man
up to?"

220
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,154
Such a cloud of mystery.

221
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,490
Now that I've been backstage?

222
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:10,526
I'm <i>deeply</i> unimpressed, Don.

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,395
You're just a bully
and a drunk.

224
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,330
A football player in a suit.

225
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:16,765
The most eloquent
I've ever heard you

226
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,299
was when you were blubbering
like a little girl

227
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,835
about your
impoverished childhood.

228
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:25,006
What? You wanna
take a swing at me?

229
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,874
It would save us all
a lot of trouble.

230
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:35,582
<i>( telephone rings )</i>

231
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:39,520

00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,854
Hey!
Get out here!

233
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,124

- What?
- Joan! Get out here.

Joan! Could you get
Cooper out here?

- Find Pete.

238

- No one knows about this?
- I saw it.

239
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:01,406
Then why did you say,
"What's going on"?

240
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,676
I want you to calm down.
I just called Jim,

241
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,377
we're going to get
to the bottom of this.

242
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,013
- Is there a meeting?
- Have you seen this?

243
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:09,448
Is this a partners' meeting?

244
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,249
You're not a partner yet.

245
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,120
This is outrageous.

246
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:17,789
You know we're going to be
at Burger Chef on Monday.

247
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:19,624
I vote against this.
Right now.

248
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,526
It's not subject to a vote.

249
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,060
The contract was very clear.

250
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:26,030
You wanna play parliamentary procedure?
Let's play.

251
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:27,699
Everyone who wants to get
rid of me, raise your hand.

252
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,368
Fine.
I have Ted's proxy.

253
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,336
You had no right
to put my name on that.

254
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,005
Anyone else?

255
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,342
All opposed?

256
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:42,045
Motion denied.

257
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,948
That is a very sensitive
piece of horseflesh.

258
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,917
He shouldn't be rattled.

259
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,818
He's a pain in the ass.

260
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,589
- You knew about this?
- No. But I'm tired of him costing me money.

261
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,530
We all set those stipulations,
and he signed them.

262
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,831
You shouldn't have done that.

263
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,267

Wait, get in here.

267
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,775
This is a suit
and it has a skirt

268
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,511
and it has grey in it,
which is what men wear.

269
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,981
And this is a dress
and it's pretty,

270
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,549
but I might be sweating

271
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,852
and not just because it's July.

272
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,055
- Forget it.
- I gotta watch Sunday.

273
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:47,823
That's when they're
supposed to land.

274
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:49,725
I'm sorry, but I'm going
to be in Indianapolis.

275
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,227
- Why?
- Because we're presenting to Burger Chef

276
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:53,995
Monday morning.

277
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,698
I know the astronauts may not make
it, and then what are we gonna say?

278
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:02,303
Oh.

279
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,305
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,408
- They're going to be fine.
- It's not fair!

281
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:08,709
You know what?
I'll give you the key

282
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,844

and watch yourself.

I don't wanna go to Newark.

and he got my mom a job.

286

Maybe you'll have a yard.

You want your mom
to have a job, don't you?

Yes, she does.

So why didn't you vote him out?

- But you're not a leader.
- And Cutler is?

352
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,005
Pilot on PA: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to ask you now</i>

353
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,575
<i>to extinguish your cigarettes
as we prepare for takeoff.</i>

354
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,944
<i>I'd like to say that we'll
be sharing the sky today</i>

355
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,080
<i>with one other</i>
<i>notable aircraft,</i>

356
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,215
<i>and I'd like to wish</i>
<i>fellow pilots</i>

357
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:35,318
<i>Neil Armstrong,</i>
<i>Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins</i>

358
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,420
<i>godspeed and a safe return.</i>

359
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:41,023
Why did you have to do that? Now
I feel like we're in danger.

360
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,524
If they don't make it, we're
going to have to postpone

361
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,959
this thing for a year.

362
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,335
You're going to go in there
and you're going to win this.

363
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,036
And if Cutler doesn't
like it, I'm sorry,

364
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,938
but the Don Draper show is back

365
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,208
from its unscheduled
interruption.

366
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,911
I appreciate that,
but I'm not rattled.

367
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,580
Well, you're sighing a lot.

368
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:09,149
What do you say you
come out to California?

369
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:12,319
It's possible if all goes
well that I could be spending

370
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:13,987
part of my time in New York.

371
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:17,424
And Ted's going to run that
place into the ground.

372
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,759
He's off the deep end.

373
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,595
Lane Pryce.

374
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,364
There's no reason to go to LA.

375
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:27,034
Is Megan moving back?

376
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,673
Marriage is a racket.

377
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:39,091
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

378
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,998
- It's happening!
- Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go!

379
00:20:46,032 --> 00:20:48,000
Come on.

380
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,671
<i>( TV playing )</i>

381
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:55,874
Indiana's dry on Sunday,

382
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,476
I had to buy these
off the night clerk.

383
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:00,313
Neil Armstrong: <i>Getting back
up to that first step...</i>

384
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:02,647
He came out.

385
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:05,583
Armstrong: ...not even collapsed
too far, but it's adequate...

386
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:08,620
- Don: Two beers?
- Mission control: <i>Roger. We copy.</i>

387
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:10,655
Armstrong: It takes a
pretty good little jump.

388
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,657
Walter Cronkite: <i>So there's
a foot on the moon.</i>

389
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,959
<i>Stepping down on the moon.</i>

390
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,494
<i>If he's testing</i>
<i>that first step,</i>

391
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,930
<i>he must be stepping down</i>
<i>on the moon at this point.</i>

392
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,268
Mission control:
<i>Buzz, this is Houston.</i>

<i>F2-1/160 second for shadow
photography on the sequence camera.</i>

Buzz Aldrin:
<i>Okay.</i>

395
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:36,814
Armstrong: <i>I'm at the
foot of the ladder.</i>

396
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:41,485
The LEM footpads are only

397
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,457

about one or two inches,

00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:56,166
<i>It's almost like a powder...</i>

401
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,767
down there.

402
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,335
It's very fine.

403
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,639
Cronkite: <i>Boy, look at
those pictures. Wow.</i>

404

Hot damn.

Neil Armstrong.</i>

<i>On this July 20th, 1969.</i>

409
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:27,295
Armstrong: That's one
small step for man,

410
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:31,065
one giant leap for mankind.

411
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,469
Bravo.

412
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:37,105
Wally Schirra: <i>I think that was
Neil's quote, I didn't understand.</i>

413
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,240
Cronkite: <i>Well, "One
small step for man,"</i>

414
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,242

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,817
It's just incredible.

418
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:54,854
I'll tell you
what's incredible.

419
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,723
It cost 25 billion dollars.

420
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:58,691
Be quiet, Sean.

421
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:01,395

- Hi, Daddy.
- Isn't this something?

- I guess.
- <i>So you're unimpressed?</i>

431
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,525
It's such a waste of money.

432

You don't really
think that, do you?

433
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:39,731
We'll be going there all the time
while people go hungry down here.

434
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,568
Don't be so cynical.

435
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,235
You want your little
brothers to talk that way?

436
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:46,838
No.

437

Well, this is unfortunate.

447
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,390
Yes.

448
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:18,293
Roger, my condolences.
He was a giant.

449
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,827
Thank you.

450
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,596
He was a wonderful man.

451
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:29,235
I'll have the obituary
ready in an hour,

452
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,237
and I suppose we can
divide up the clients

453
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:32,305
and start calling them.

454
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,107
It's 1:00
in the morning.

455
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:35,842
The agency and the world
are closed tomorrow.

456
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:38,411
Do we have to do this now?

457
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:41,648
Well, as tragic as this
is, I for one am happy

458
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:44,317
that we have a chance to have a
conversation with the clients

459
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:46,152
about the future
of this company.

460
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:50,557
And to give Don Draper
a send-off along with Bert.

461
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,291
Excuse me?

462
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,626
I hate to remind you that
with Harry's partnership

463
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:58,430
and without Bert, Don's dismissal
is a foregone conclusion.

464
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:00,399
Cooper's been dead an hour

465
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,933
and you're prying
his hand open?

466
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,469
Roger, I know what this
company should look like.

467
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:08,607
Computer services. Media buys
pinpointed with surgical accuracy.

<i>We can offer the services</i>

It's the agency of the future.

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,081
Is this what would
happen if I died?

00:26:18,484 --> 00:26:20,051

Yes.
Is that okay?

475
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:40,371
Yeah, I don't want them
giving me shit for smoking.

476
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:44,842
Smoking causes cancer.

477
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:52,783
How does it look?
Can you see it?

478
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:55,919
The moon?
Nah, it's already set.

479
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,755
Then why aren't you
watching TV?

480
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:03,426
I don't wanna listen to
them or the reporters.

481
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:06,630
Besides, there's other
things to look at.

482
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:09,266
Like what?

483
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,201
Polaris.
It's a star.

484
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:14,804
Take a look.

485
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,245
I can't see anything.

486
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,313
Do you see your eyelashes?

487
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,615
Yes.

488
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,486
Okay.

489
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,456
Tilt your head back and
open your eyes really wide.

490
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,258
Okay.

491
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:40,061
I think I see it.

492
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:42,498
Isn't that better than TV?

493
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,968
It is.

494
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,711
What do I do now?

495
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:59,980
Carolyn: <i>Neil, honey?
Where are you?</i>

496
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:01,548
I'm outside.

497
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:03,684
Carolyn: <i>Get in here!
It's bedtime!</i>

498
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,014
<i>Neil, this is Houston.</i>
<i>Did you get the Hasselblad...</i>

- Figured you'd still be up.

501
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:41,426
Roger?
How'd you find me?

502
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:44,296
Your itinerary was on
Caroline's desk.

503
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,398
I'm at the office.

504
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:48,967
Bert passed away.

505
00:28:54,372 --> 00:28:56,540
He was in his living room
on the couch.

506
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:02,146
Roger, I'm so sorry.

507
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,149
I know what he meant to you.

508
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:09,253
Well, now I'm
gonna lose you, too.

509
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,355
We don't have
the votes anymore.

510
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,890
It's the first thing
Cutler said.

511
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:16,392
( sighs )
Well, he's consistent.

512
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,030
Poor Bert.

513
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,098
I should've realized
it was the end.

514
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,467
Every time an old man starts
talking about Napoleon,

515
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:25,935
you know they're gonna die.

516
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,705
Is his sister still alive?

517
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:32,542
He was hard on me, you know?

518
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,277
But maybe he was right.

519
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,150
The last thing I said to him
were the lines to some old song.

520
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:44,521
Come on, Roger, you know
he was very proud of you.

521
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:48,491
Give 'em hell tomorrow.

522
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,961
Okay.

523
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:04,040
( sighs )

524
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,613
( sighs )

525
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:14,849
Aldrin: <i>Okay. The hatch
is closed and latched...</i>

526
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,119
- ( knocking on door )
- <i>( TV playing )</i>

527
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:25,458
May I speak with you?

528
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,494
Of course.
Is something wrong?

529
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:30,097
May I come in?

530
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,205
There's been a change of plans.

531
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,974
You're gonna give the
presentation tomorrow.

532
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,310
Did Harry tell you
about my dream?

533
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,379
What? No.

534
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:48,515
We have a couple hours. You can
practice it with me and still be fresh.

535
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:53,319
- Are you serious?
- You're gonna be great.

536
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,754
No. Stop
messing around.

537
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,723
It's not funny.

538
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:00,126
( TV off )

539
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,727
( sighs )

540
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:04,063
You must have heard that
they're trying to get me out.

541
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,532
If I win this business,
and then I go,

542
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,567
you'll be left with nothing.

543
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,969
They're trying to get you out?

544
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:13,205
I thought everything was
finally back to normal.

545
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,273
Me, too, but...

546
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,942
sometimes actions
have consequences

547
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,277
and one of them is I
can't present tomorrow.

548
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:22,915
<i>You</i> win this business
and it will be yours.

549
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,758
No, Don.

550
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,194
It's tomorrow.
I'm unprepared.

551
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,929
You've been listening
to me for weeks.

552
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,464
Well, I can't just say
what <i>you've</i> been saying.

553
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,667
I'm a woman. I'm the
"voice of moms," remember?

554
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,472
Maybe that's better.

555
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,374
Maybe that's the way it
always should have been.

556
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,576
Well, Pete won't stand for it.

557
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,845
Pete's pregnant.
He has to do what we say.

558
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:00,316
No. Cancel it.
What about the moon landing?

559
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,752
- It was a success.
- No, Don.

560
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,254
I have to talk to people who
just touched the face of God

561
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:07,457
about hamburgers!

562
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,959
I wouldn't do this if I
didn't know you could.

563
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,131
You've never even
seen me present.

564
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,567
I've overheard things.

565
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,206
We have no liquor.

566
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:29,712
Good morning.

567
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,379
Did you see we
landed on the moon?

568
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:34,616
( chuckles )
Is that right?

569
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,251
Neil Armstrong, what are you going
to do with the rest of your life?

570
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,654
Screw every girl
in Florida, I guess.

571
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:42,423
So you called me at sunrise to
discuss the meaning of life?

572
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:46,527
No. I just want to know
if Buick had left you yet.

573
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:47,996
Why would they do that?

574
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,931
Because we've built
a relationship with GM

575
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,599
and they know we can
handle a bigger car.

576
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:54,534
<i>And</i> our Chevy account
man just moved there.

577
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,107
Uncle.

578
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,942
So, you made the overture.

579
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:04,077
What did you have in mind?

580
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:07,747
Well...

581
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:09,915
we'd want the whole Chevy team.

582
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,152
You, Jim Cutler, Don Draper,

583
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:14,120
and Ted Chaough.

584
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:16,656
We both know you're in
the acquisitions business.

585
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,659
I think... you should
buy the whole company.

586
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,161
Because I have a vision.

587
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:26,231
All our accounts, our
cutting-edge computer,

588
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,999
and the employees that
I know to be worthy

589
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,736
as an independent
subsidiary of McCann.

590
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,371
You just lost Burger
Chef, we may win it.

591
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:33,739
Then you'd still have it.

592
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:35,440
And I'd have
my company--

593
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:38,710
without Jim Cutler and all
that baggage from CGC.

594
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:44,214
That's an interesting idea.

595
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:47,518
But this is still
all about Buick.

596
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:50,788
You have to bury the
hatchet with Ted Chaough.

597
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,023
- Why?
- Because GM thinks he

598
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:56,427
and Don Draper are one person.

599
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:58,596
I don't know if I can do that.

600
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,731
Well, then, I don't know
if I can help you.

601
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:07,336
<i>( low whirring )</i>

602
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:15,311
( coughs )

603
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,079
<i>( faint voices overlapping )</i>

604
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,650
<i>( whirring continues )</i>

605
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:24,454
( laughing )

606
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:42,337
I'm gonna be bold and say

607
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,138
that no one in this room

608
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,673
knows more about the
Burger Chef customer

609
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,509
than Peggy Olson.

610
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,878
She's visited 20 restaurants
in nine states,

611
00:34:50,912 --> 00:34:52,947
interviewed hundreds
and is obviously

612
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:56,417
uniquely qualified to craft
this modern campaign.

613
00:34:58,553 --> 00:35:02,222
Every great ad tells a story.

614
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:04,523
Here to tell that story
is Peggy Olson.

615
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,260
Thank you, Don.

616
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:10,496
That's a lot to live up to.

617
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,399
Because I certainly
can't tell a better story

618
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:16,535
than the one we saw last night.

619
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,138
I don't know what was
more miraculous--

620
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:21,074
the technological achievement

621
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:25,078
that put our species
in a new perspective

622
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:28,848
or the fact that all of us were doing
the same thing at the same time.

623
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:31,584
<i>Sitting in this room,</i>

624
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:35,788
we can still feel the
pleasure of that connection.

625
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:39,324
Because, I realize now,
we were starved for it.

626
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,160
We really were.

627
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:48,400
And, yes, we'll feel it again
when they all return safely.

628
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:54,505
And, yes, the world will never
be the same in some ways.

629
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,275
But tonight, I'm going
to go back to New York,

630
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,777
and I'll go back
to my apartment

631
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,814
and find
a 10-year-old boy

632
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:06,417
parked in front
of my TV, eating dinner.

633
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:12,756
Now, I don't need to charge
you for a research report

634
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,359
that tells you that
most television sets

635
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:19,362
are not more than six feet
away from the dinner table.

636
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,664
And that dinner table

637
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:24,267
is your battlefield
and your prize.

638
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,739
This is the home your
customers really live in.

639
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:31,241
This is <i>your</i> dinner table.

640
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,778
Dad likes Sinatra,
son likes The Rolling Stones.

641
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:40,717
The TV's always on, Vietnam
playing in the background.

642
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:44,387
The news wins every night.

643
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:47,156
And you're starving.

644
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,758
And not just for dinner.

645
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,868
What if there
was another table,

646
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:02,238
where everybody gets what
they want when they want it?

647
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:05,975
<i>It's bright and clean,</i>

648
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:07,776
and there's no laundry,

649
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:12,013
no telephone, and no TV.

650
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:14,949
And we can have the connection

651
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,985
that we're hungry for.

652
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:23,591
There may be chaos at home,

653
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:29,563
but there's family supper
at Burger Chef.

654
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,435
That's beautiful.

655
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,308
That's nice to hear

656
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,776
because that's
the name of the spot.

657
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,747
( chuckling )

658
00:37:56,391 --> 00:38:00,494
We open on a bird's-eye view
of a typical kitchen table.

659
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,928
<i>( elevator bell pings )</i>

660
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,769
- Welcome home.
- How'd you get in here?

661
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:12,838
Money. But he wouldn't
open the door.

662
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:14,973
I need to talk to ya.

663
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,442
Cooper still dead?

664
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,910
His situation hasn't
changed, but ours has.

665
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:20,646
Can I get a drink?

666
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:28,320
- Roger: How'd it go?
- Great.

667
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,256
That why you're here?

668
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,325
We got an offer from McCann
Erickson to buy the agency.

669
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,596
Hear me out. We'd be a
subsidiary, separately operated.

670
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:40,799
We keep our name, our
offices, you keep your job--

671
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,735
your real job-- and
I'll be the president.

672
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,971
- Of McCann?
- No, of Sterling Cooper.

673
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,306
They know we're primed
for a big car,

674
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,007
and they don't want
to compete with us.

675
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:52,544
Did you forget we started <i>this
</i> agency to get away from them?

676
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,246
Yeah, I know that. But a
lot's happened in between.

677
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:57,248
Most of it good,
but some of it very bad.

678
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:59,651
Without Cooper, Cutler's gonna lock
you out by the end of the week.

679
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:02,453
- I don't want to work for McCann.
- You're gonna work for <i>me.</i>

680
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:05,823
Don't fool yourself. You know
they're not gonna leave us alone.

681
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:09,927
They did with Marschalk. And they're buying 51%.
You're gonna make a fortune.

682
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,730
Fine, you have my vote.
What's that gonna do?

683
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,999
You can't even save my job, how
are you gonna sell the company?

684
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:18,335
I'm working on it. You're
of essence to the deal.

685
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:22,639
But so is Ted Chaough.

686
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:24,208
Ted Chaough?
What are you doing?

687
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,443
They want the guys
who won Chevy.

688
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:30,047
Roger, I just wanna do my work. I don't
wanna deal with business anymore.

689
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:32,583
And what about everyone else?
We all send out resumes?

690
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:36,553
Cutler's not gonna stop until the
firm is just Harry and the computer.

691
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,756
That means everybody goes.

692
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,960
And you know it.

693
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:45,762
<i>( door closes )</i>

694
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,526
- ( raps )
- Ted, welcome back.

695
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,228
Well, I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

696
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:54,863
I've instructed Don to
gather everyone at noon.

697
00:39:54,898 --> 00:39:56,666
Did you want to
discuss the remarks?

698
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,902
I thought we would begin with
a poem of memorial for Bert.

699
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,937
"O Captain, My Captain"?

700
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,772
Then we have a lot
of pressing business here

701
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:05,407
with finalizing Don's
departure and--

702
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:07,242
And I have an
announcement of my own.

703
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,578
We don't need
to deal with that today.

704
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,447
I haven't heard anything.

705
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:15,584
- About what?
- Burger Chef.

706
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:19,722
- Good morning.
- I'm glad that you're here.

707
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,389
Would you please
all have a seat?

708
00:40:21,424 --> 00:40:24,626
There's coffee. I have some
rather urgent business.

709
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,629
I insist.

710
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:40,942
I'm coming to all of you
with an incredible opportunity.

711
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:44,645
McCann Erickson wants
to buy a 51% stake in SC&P.

712
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,413
We'll be independently operated,

713
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,415
and all they ask are
five-year contracts

714
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,050
from everyone.

715
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,853
- Including Don?
- Especially Don.

716
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,988
And you'll be our king.

717
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,658
Well, I did put it together.

718
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,159
The details have
to be worked out,

719
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:02,763
but we'll keep our office,
our name, and our clients.

720
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:05,799
- Why would they do that?
- Because we finally turned this place

721
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:09,102
into a legitimate threat and they'd like
to neutralize it with cold, hard cash.

722
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,304
- How much?
- When did you do this?

723
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:13,573
Since you asked, I'll
use you as an example.

724
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:16,243
Let's say they value
the agency at $65 million

725
00:41:16,277 --> 00:41:17,878
and they buy 51% of it.

726
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:21,982
That means your 5% share's worth
a little over $1.5 million.

727
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:25,584
- <i>25% of that upon signing.</i>
- Oh, my goodness.

728
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:27,853
I've got 10%!

729
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,454
Keep counting those chickens.

730
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,391
I hope you all realize this is a
pathetic ploy and a delusion.

731
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:35,161
It is until everybody
votes on it.

732
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,830
Sorry, just heard
about the partners' meeting.

733
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:40,666
- Perfect timing.
- He hasn't signed. He missed the boat.

734
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,701
- What's going on?
- None of your beeswax.

735
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:45,303
- I'll take the deal.
- Goodbye, Harry.

736
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,438
Don't worry about it.

737
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,678
- Well, I won't do it.
- That's fine because you're not of essence.

738
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:58,149
- And you <i>are?</i> - Yes, all they care about
is me, Don, and Ted.

739
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:01,953
Don, you're gonna sign a contract
to work at McCann for five years?

740
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:06,024
- Well, I've given this a lot of thought.
- I'm sure you did.

741
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:08,292
And I agree with Roger that we
should do everything we can

742
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:11,529
to keep Jim from
breaking up the agency.

743
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,197
You mean, save your hide.

744
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,799
Look, I don't want
to stand in the way

745
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,200
of everyone making
all this money,

746
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,436
but I am done with advertising.

747
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,739
Your 20% share will
be worth at least $6 million.

748
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,674
I'm going to have
plenty of money

749
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,776
from selling my
partnership as it stands.

750
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:27,110
Can't you do it without me?

751
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,078
You don't think I tried that?

752
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,080
If I sign a contract
for five years,

753
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,383
that'll be the rest of my life.

754
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,520
- You've got to be kidding me.
- You're not just pathetic, you're selfish.

755
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,422
Well, I'm sorry, Roger.

756
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:42,191
You may have the votes,
but you don't have a deal.

757
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,827
Now can we dispense
with this nonsense,

758
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,262
go outside and say
a fond farewell?

759
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,031
Ted.

760
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,935
What if I told you that
you could just write copy

761
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,137
and fight clients
and not worry about

762
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:58,841
partnership votes
or stock prices?

763
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,576
You could just
go back to creative.

764
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,778
I have that right now,
and I'm miserable.

765
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,613
No, you don't.

766
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,749
I really lost this last year

767
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:09,684
and I realized I would do
anything to get back in.

768
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:10,818
And I did anything.

769
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:13,788
I wrote tags, I wrote coupons.

770
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:17,958
Things I haven't done
since I first got my start.

771
00:43:17,993 --> 00:43:22,196
I know you. I know the man who
I walked into Chevy with.

772
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:25,132
You don't have to work for us,

773
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:27,435
but you have to work.

774
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:32,239
You don't wanna see what
happens when it's really gone.

775
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:35,976
You remember the last time he
talked you into something?

776
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:41,415
I don't know.

777
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:50,256
- So, I'd move back to the city?
- Ted's in. Let's have a vote.

778
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,191
- Hold on.
- Let's have a vote.

779
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,227
Everyone in favor.

780
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,198
( sighs )

781
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,471
Really?

782
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:08,307
It's a lot of money.

783
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:11,677
( voices overlapping )

784
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:23,055
I just got off the phone
with Burger Chef.

785
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:25,457
They couldn't find anyone.

786
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,593
We got it.

787
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:31,029
Well, they heard what I heard.

788
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,602
Where are you going?

789
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:39,637
Back to work.

790
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:44,208
Dawn: <i>Excuse me, everyone. If
I could have your attention.</i>

791
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:48,245
Mr. Sterling would like
to make an announcement.

792
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,881
Thank you, everyone.

793
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:53,384
It's difficult that at this
moment of national pride,

794
00:44:53,418 --> 00:44:56,720
we have to deal with
some sad, personal news.

795
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:58,535
On Sunday night we
lost our founder...
