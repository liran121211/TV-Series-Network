2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,360
- I have a two-year contract.
- Calm down.

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,697
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

4
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,007
I forgive you.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,409
And I forgive you.

6
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,317
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

7
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:12,514
What?

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,471
There are some stipulations.

9
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:17,427
Outside of client hospitality,
there will be no drinking in the office.

10
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:19,019
You'll be in Lane's old office.

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,320
And you will report to Lou.

12
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:25,448
Our fortunes are
in other people's hands...

13
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,179
and we have to take them.

18
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,561

00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:19,011
or Palm Springs, which--

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,646
are you listening to me?

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,119
Don't look.
Turn around.

23
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,395
That man is staring at me.

24
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,263
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't
looking for a better conversation.

25
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,368
It's a little rude,
but I'm fine.

26
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:35,742
- What were you saying?
- Very well.

27
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:38,743
What are you doing?

28
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:41,148
George?

29
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,291
I didn't want to bother you.

30
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,429
You're obviously
here on business.

31
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,499
What?

32
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,169
No.

33
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:53,010
Trudy and I are divorced--
getting divorced.

34
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,281
I've relocated to our
West Coast office.

35
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:58,025
George Payton, this is Bonnie,
my real estate agent.

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,563
I wish you would stop
introducing me that way.

37
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,567
Why? It's good
for business.

38
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:04,606
Okay, what if I say,

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,850
"Bonnie, my girlfriend,
<i>your</i> real estate agent"?

40
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,587
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

41
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:12,359
What brings you to LA?
There's no cough-and-cold season.

42
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:14,760
- George works for Vicks.
- Oh.

43
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,362
Actually, I left.
Please, sit.

44
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,134
I'm working
for Burger Chef now.

45
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,638
You can't be in
the hamburger business

46
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,074
without taking a swing
at Disneyland.

47
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:26,241
When did that happen?

48
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,243
Right after Tom's heart attack.

49
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,145
I thought of you.

50
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,818
- Tom who?
- Tom Vogel.

51
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,157
He had a heart attack?

52
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,194
Who's that?

53
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:39,564
My father-in-law.

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,065
I hadn't heard about that.

55
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,569
He's fine.

56
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,205
Who knew he had a heart?

57
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,310
Yes, right.

58
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,845
You know we're putting
McCann in review.

59
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,080
Be nice for us to work together
without old Tom in the way.

60
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:54,551
Hm.

61
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,954
It would kill him.

62
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:57,888
( chuckles )

63
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,258
Do you want to join us?

64
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,831
How about I give you a call

65
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,966
when I get back
to the home office?

66
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,304
Of course.

67
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:10,877
Have a wonderful evening.

68
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,352
I love watching you work.

69
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,256
That was skillful.

70
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,160
Those conversations
happen all the time.

71
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,763
Doesn't mean anything.

72
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,743

75
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,913
Ahem--
any questions?

76
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,152
Where are we supposed to work?

77
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,089
You all have offices.

78
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:38,159
Lloyd, from LeaseTech,
has informed us

79
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,896
that the footprint of the
machine was prohibitive.

80
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,133
<i>And then it occurred to us,</i>

81
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,771
why not let every client
who sets foot in that door

82
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:48,606
know that this agency
has entered the future?

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,539
( applause )

84
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,881
And please, we will try
and keep the construction

85
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:00,317
and installation process
as brief as possible,

86
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,024
but steer clear of the
area for your own safety.

87
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:04,794
You might want to wear shoes.

88
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:06,296
Thank you all.

89
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,034
Dawn: If you have any personal
items in the creative lounge,

90
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,937
please remove them immediately.

91
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:17,108
Anything left behind at noon
today will be assumed garbage.

92
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,812
They're driving us underground.

93
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,147
You know Lou didn't
fight for our space.

94
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,450
He doesn't believe in creative because
he doesn't know how to do it.

95
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,419
Trust me, you're going
to use that computer

96
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,755
more than you use that lounge.

97
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,594
Did he hear me?

98
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,403
Why were you late?
You know that's a no-no.

99
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,003
I wasn't late.
I didn't get a memo.

100
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:41,303
I don't even know
what's going on.

101
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,137
Well, we're getting a computer.

102
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:45,006
It's going to do
lots of magical things,

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,742
like make Harry Crane
seem important.

104
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:49,143
This decision must have been
made at the partners' level.

105
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:52,378
It preceded you. You got a
problem, take it up with Cutler.

106
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,278
Think it's too early

107
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:59,512
to come in and celebrate our
technological advancement?

108
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,480
I think that's worse than
being late, isn't it?

109
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:03,682
You're right.
Good thinking.

110
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:06,083
Maybe later, off campus.

111
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,394
Harry Crane took a huge dump,

112
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,095
and we got flushed
down the toilet.

113
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,166
Ginsberg, don't you
believe in advertising?

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,970
That computer
is the "Mona Lisa."

115
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,938
People pay entry
to the whole Louvre

116
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:28,607
just to walk by that thing.

117
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:32,875
This is what was unique
about this place.

118
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,578
I want the couch.

119
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,647
That is not going to
fit in our office.

120
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,249
Why don't we switch it with
the one in Lane's office?

121
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:40,818
Because that one's really good.

122
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,719
You mean Don's office?

123
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,889
Don! Will you take
the other end of this?

124
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,159
Okay.

125
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,770
You gotta hold your
side a little lower.

126
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:00,105
I'm on the heavy side of
the seesaw right now.

127
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,178
A little to your right.

128
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,112
My right.

129
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,179
Damn it, Ginsberg.
Put it back.

130
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,946
It's too big for our office.

131
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,445
Come on, Stan.
I wanna try.

132
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,912
The other one's full of farts.

133
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,685
You're on your own.

134
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,658
Ginsberg:<i> Let me put this in terms
the art department can understand--</i>

135
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:23,695
they're trying to erase us!

136
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,667
( yells ) But they can't
erase this couch!

137
00:07:58,198 --> 00:08:00,399
( sighs )

138
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,467
So, in addition
to the fruitful nature

139
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,102
of our previous
relationship at Vicks,

140
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:08,475
George is very excited about
our bicoastal presence.

141
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,548
Are we concerned about a conflict
with H Salt Fish & Chips?

142
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,250
Pete:<i> - Ted?</i>
- H Salt views themselves

143
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,520
as a specialty restaurant,
not fast food.

144
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,724
( chuckles )
That's a joke, right?

145
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,561
Pete, what did your friend
at Burger Chef say?

146
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:25,834
They're going to open
their thousandth store

147
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,769
and that's across 45 states.

148
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,971
<i>George Payton knows</i>
<i>who his competition is</i>

149
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,606
and he loves that we
understand the franchise game.

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,038
Well, Ted, you're the
king of fish and chips,

151
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,972
but I don't want you running
the team from out there.

152
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:39,309
We're calling you home.

153
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:42,776
Sorry, Jim,
I'm not going anywhere.

154
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:44,713
I think we should
put Peggy on it.

155
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,916
This is a national campaign.

156
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,717
It's almost three million
in billings.

157
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,483
The whole thing's
about the kitchen

158
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,415
and the cleanliness and
getting to the homemakers.

159
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,250
They'll want a woman.

160
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,556
Lou?

161
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,421
I think Peggy
is the right choice.

162
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,188
Well, I'm glad all agree the
client is going to love

163
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:05,622
having a woman's
point of view--

164
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,558
or whatever
Peggy counts as--

165
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:10,925
but is Don not even
on the list?

166
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,759
I was thinking the same thing.

167
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,994
He's spent three weeks
alone in that cave,

168
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,493
and he hasn't clubbed
another ape yet.

169
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,162
High praise indeed.
Lou?

170
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:23,332
Don's a very valuable
piece of talent.

171
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,833
He should be put
to work already.

172
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,036
Absolutely.

173
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:29,807
Roger:
<i>Good work all around.</i>

174
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,108
That's what I always say,

175
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:32,909
this business
is about relationships.

176
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,244
Bye-bye, boys.

177
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,048
Ted:
Dee, we're done.

178
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,618
Let's see them give<i> that</i>
to Bob Benson.

179
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:43,123
We done here?

180
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,965
I thought we had an
understanding about Don.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,067
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

182
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:54,268
He's an exquisite copywriter,
if nothing else.

183
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,906
He's gonna implode.

184
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,344
That's a distinct
possibility, isn't it?

185
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:01,345
On the other hand, you
might get some good work.

186
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:08,152
( squealing )

187
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,658
Hey, spud.
Get over here.

188
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:18,864
- What's going on?
- We're playing "hide-and-go-seek."

189
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,568
You hear that, Caroline?
Someone's hunting big game.

190
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,770
And someone's looking for<i> you.</i>

191
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:27,074
- Is Mommy here?
- No, Daddy and Nana.

192
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:30,244
They're in there.
Ellery and I are supposed to "go play."

193
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,447
See ya later, alligator.

194
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,017
( rattles )

195
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,991
Mona, Brooks.

196
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,895
What a pleasant surprise.

197
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,132
Mona: - Margaret's run away.
- To where? Bergdorf's?

198
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,269
It's not a joke.
She's upstate

199
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:50,936
with some sort of
religious cult.

200
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,036
- What?
- It's a commune.

201
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,472
Mona: - You don't know that.
- What the hell happened?

202
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:57,007
I can't get a straight story.

203
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,741
Because I don't know
why you need to know.

204
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,607
Apparently, she
woke up one morning

205
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,474
and got in a van with some
hippies that she barely knew.

206
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,010
She's only been gone
a few days.

207
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,812
10. Brooks and I
think it best

208
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,246
if you go up there
and retrieve her.

209
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:10,917
The only reason I even told you

210
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,622
is because I need someone
to watch my son,

211
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,022
and I thought it best
it be family.

212
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,755
If you don't want to do it, I've got
a long list of strangers I can pay.

213
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,687
You're upset.

214
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,658
You're not thinking right.

215
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,491
We can't help you if you
don't tell us what happened.

216
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:32,796
Look, she hasn't
been herself lately

217
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,299
and we went to this
marriage encounter group.

218
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,101
( chuckles )
You're kidding.

219
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,803
She wanted to, and I thought

220
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,572
it would be good for her
to talk to people.

221
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,006
That's always a mistake.

222
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,642
Roger!

223
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:48,146
Brooks, sweetheart,

224
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,346
I don't mind watching
my grandson,

225
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,914
but it sounds like
you tried to stop her

226
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:53,918
and you obviously failed.

227
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:57,024
- A father is a powerful thing.
- What are you doing?

228
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,192
Of course, she'll watch him.
Let the man be a man.

229
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:03,162
I appreciate that, sir.
I'm gonna go say goodbye.

230
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:06,162
I'm telling him that I'm
joining her on vacation.

231
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,499
Good idea.

232
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,270
- <i> ( door closes )</i>
- What kind of a sales pitch was that?

233
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:17,371
- That was terrible.
- I agree with him.

234
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:19,776
She is off her rocker

235
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,413
and she has run away with,

236
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,681
from what I can glean,
more than one lover.

237
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:26,450
I only know one other person who
would do something like that.

238
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,119
How is this my fault?

239
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:31,254
Because she is a perverse child
who only thinks of herself.

240
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:32,823
Look, I know you're upset.

241
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:35,260
I am terribly worried.

242
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:38,998
It'll be fine.

243
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,402
<i>( door closes )</i>

244
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,375
( whirring )

245
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,341
Harry: <i>Well, it was
a variety show,</i>

246
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:51,677
and it featured this computer

247
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,347
that was programming
the variety acts.

248
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:55,318
And they had a lot of
psychedelic graphics.

249
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:56,854
It was obvious that
whoever did the sets

250
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:59,056
had never seen the
IBM 360, I can say.

251
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,558
Lloyd: <i>Maybe I'll go buy a TV.
I can catch it.</i>

252
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:04,461
You should get a TV, but it got
cancelled 11 minutes into the premiere.

253
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:07,466
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying
to kill himself the whole show.

254
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,134
Probably to get out
of his contract.

255
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,902
Don Draper, this is
Lloyd Hawley.

256
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,503
- Lloyd's with LeaseTech.
- I saw you at the announcement.

257
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,305
And what do you do
around here, Don?

258
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,675
Oh. Don is,
uh, a partner

259
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,211
and our creative director.

260
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,615
I thought Lou was
the creative director.

261
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,615
- We have two.
- We have three.

262
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,315
I mean, there's Ted, too.

263
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:27,850
You must have a hell of
a business right now.

264
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,853
We'll see.
It's tough,

265
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:32,817
because we both sell IBM's
product and compete with them.

266
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,452
Who's winning? Who's
replacing more humans?

267
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:39,955
Listen, I apologize
about your work area.

268
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,121
It wasn't my idea.

269
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,554
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your lunchroom.

270
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,924
- It's not symbolic.
- No, it's quite literal.

271
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,526
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd.

272
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,326
Some of us have work to do.

273
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,131
This is why I supervise
the installations.

274
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,600
There's always
some kind of trouble.

275
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't worry,
that goes back years.

276
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,200
Well, I go into
businesses every day,

277
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:02,568
and it's been my experience

278
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,071
these machines
can be a metaphor

279
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:05,707
for whatever's
on people's minds.

280
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,174
Because they're
afraid of computers?

281
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,077
Yes. This machine
is frightening to people,

282
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,779
but it's made by people.

283
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,247
And people aren't frightening?

284
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,351
It's not that.

285
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:18,121
It's more of
a cosmic disturbance.

286
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,990
This machine is intimidating

287
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,727
because it contains infinite
quantities of information,

288
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,029
and that's threatening,

289
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,999
because human existence
is finite.

290
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,834
But isn't it godlike

291
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,204
that we've mastered
the infinite?

292
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,038
The IBM 360 can count
more stars in a day

293
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,238
than we can in a lifetime.

294
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,706
But what man laid on his back

295
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,876
counting stars and
thought about a number?

296
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,977
He probably thought about
going to the moon.

297
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,079
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd.
I should get back in there.

298
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,386
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

299
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:02,988
<i>( hammering fades )</i>

300
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,263
<i>( faint drill whirring )</i>

301
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,034
It's quite a view, isn't it?

302
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:16,803
I like to think of myself
as a leader, Peggy,

303
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,536
and that means
doling out discipline.

304
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,903
But it also means tempering it

305
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,573
with encouragement.

306
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,909
Which should I be prepared for?

307
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,779
I didn't hire you,
but I would have,

308
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:31,685
and I would've paid you
as befits your senior status.

309
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,923
I'm giving you
$100 more a week.

310
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,831
I'm writing it
on this piece of paper

311
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:45,265
because I've found that
saying things around here...

312
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,204
is useless.

313
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:54,409
Well, I...

314
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:58,046
appreciate that.
Very much.

315
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,848
Well, with it comes a mission.

316
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,550
I'm putting you
in charge of Burger Chef.

317
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,617
Really?

318
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:06,117
Carve out hours for whomever
you want on the team.

319
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,387
And Don.

320
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:11,325
- Don Draper?
- He's the one.

321
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,331
Thank you so much, Lou.

322
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:21,736
Knock 'em dead.

323
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,137
Have you told Don?

324
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,472
You're in charge, sweetheart.

325
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,511
<i>( tools whirring )</i>

326
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,285
<i>( hammers banging )</i>

327
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,190
- Is he in?
- He never leaves.

328
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,277
Marsha, can you bring Don
and Mathis to my office?

329
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,776
<i>Certainly.</i>

330
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:11,679
- <i> ( knocking on door )</i>
- Come in.

331
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,183
Please don't eat that.
You're so trim.

332
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,188
- Anything else?
- Miss Olson would like to see you.

333
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:25,092
- Send her in.
- No, I'm to send<i> you</i> in.

334
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,630
Okay.

335
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:42,114
- You wanted to see me?
- Can I offer you something?

336
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,551
It was a long walk, but no.

337
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,820
I have what I think
is very good news.

338
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,622
I hope you'll see it that way.

339
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,091
Hey, Don.

340
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,271
I don't know if you've
heard the rumors,

341
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,774
but Pete Campbell has gotten us a
presentation with Burger Chef.

342
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,076
All I know is it's
national fast food.

343
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:13,444
- They run a new spot every month.
- That's right.

344
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,446
But we have to win it first,

345
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,215
and that's why I wanted
you both on my team.

346
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,485
Congratulations.

347
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,986
Congratulations to you.

348
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,953
Mathis:
<i>How long do we have?</i>

349
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,220
I don't know yet, but I want
to get started right away.

350
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:30,124
I think 25 tags
should get the ball rolling.

351
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:32,160
- I'll get right on it.
- Apiece.

352
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,196
That's 50 total
between the two of you.

353
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,411
- What's the strategy?
- Lou likes to start with the tags

354
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,580
and then sneak up
on a strategy.

355
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,316
You'll get used to it.

356
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,420
Well, that'll do it.

357
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,060
- Thanks for thinking of me.
- I look forward to your work.

358
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,063
Monday.

359
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:05,064
<i>( door closes )</i>

360
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:10,304

361
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,044

362

<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

363
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,343
- How was your weekend?
Don: - Lonely.

364
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:48,712
- How was yours?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

365
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,984
Oh, I'm sorry. You have a
meeting with Miss Olson,

366
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:57,286
and the Burger Chef
research came in.

367
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:09,301
- Is he in?
- Yes.

368
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,438
Good.

369
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:26,044
Oh, good.

370
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:27,378
Don't act like you
were looking for me.

371
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,911
I was looking for you.

372
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,981
I need coffee.
I didn't sleep last night.

373
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,682
Well, Mona called,

374
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:35,685
and I'm supposed
to read you this message.

375
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,220
"Hey, genius!
Brooks is in jail in Kingston."

376
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,688
From now on, you don't listen
to her, you listen to me.

377
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,958
And what I really like
is no matter what you order,

378
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,426
they give you
a side of spaghetti,

379
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,126
even if you order spaghetti.

380
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,495
What, Burger Chef does?

381
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,432
No, Vito's.

382
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,202
I can go get him.

383
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,887
Don:
<i>Come in.</i>

384
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,928
It's time for the meeting.

385
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:22,030
I can't make it.

386
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,332
Oh.

387
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,734
Do you want me
to turn in your tags?

388
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:27,068
Nope.

389
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:28,636
Okay.

390
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,707
He's not coming.

391
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,478
- What?
- That's what he said.

392
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,883
Is that right?

393
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:43,718
I guess he's not ready.

394
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,218
I mean, we did
just get the research.

395
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:52,566
I would really appreciate a chance
to beef these up, as it were.

396
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,035
I mean, if Don's
going to get more time.

397
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,374
Here's a better idea.

398
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:01,743
Why don't we move the meeting
to the end of the day,

399
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:04,681
and you give me what you've
got now plus 25 more?

400
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:07,213
That's going to be 50.

401
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,012
But now you have the research.

402
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,762
<i>( bangs glove box )</i>

403
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:27,600
- Hey.
- Nothing works.

404
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,602
You need to calm down.
I don't want this

405
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,603
turning into "The Guiding
Light" the moment we get there.

406
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:34,306
Ha. I'm worried,
but you're angry.

407
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,241
Don't lose your temper.

408
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,676
How much cash do you have?

409
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,543
Why don't you reach in
and check?

410
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,242
His bail is 180.

411
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,276
Let Brooks spend another day
in the slammer.

412
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:46,611
- He'll just get in the way.
- No, obviously.

413
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,847
I meant we should spring
him on the way back.

414
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,521
He's a bum. If he wasn't a bum,
she wouldn't have left him.

415
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:54,023
She told him she was
never leaving that place

416
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,525
and that he and Ellery
could stay there.

417
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,426
And what was he supposed to do?

418
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,092
He was supposed to get into
a fight with those hippies,

419
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,562
not some rednecks in a
bar three hours later.

420
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,032
It's my fault.

421
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,835
I always let her
out of everything.

422
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:08,639
She only had one job and
that was to find a husband,

423
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:11,610
- and she mucked it up.
- You liked him.

424
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:15,380
I thought he was good
enough for the time being.

425
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:16,915
( sighs )

426
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,984
I wanted her to wait
like I did.

427
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,453
You only waited
because<i> I</i> wasn't available.

428
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,656
Well, look how that worked out.

429
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,059
What was she supposed to think?

430
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:29,694
"Things are hard, I'll
just find another man."

431
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,763
That can't be it.

432
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:34,603
Oh, God, I hope she's
not a drug addict--

433
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:37,506
although they usually
stay in the city.

434
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,910
- How do you know that?
- "Life" magazine.

435
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:44,314
It's probably another man,
who probably has drugs.

436
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,813
You and me is not
such a bad example.

437
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,816
I mean, what psychiatrist is
Ellery going to be telling one day

438
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,785
about the weekend
his dad was in jail

439
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,585
and his mom was in a commune?

440
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,952
I'm sure you can recommend one.

441
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,789
You know, I haven't
seen her in a while,

442
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:00,156
because the last time I did,

443
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:03,458
she was so cruel and so serene.

444
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:06,195
She<i> has</i> been strange lately.

445
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,263
And a little bit philosophical?

446
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,435
Yes.

447
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,671
( chuckles )

448
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,539
I thought she was
finally happy.

449
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,529
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

450
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,628
Come in.

451
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:34,029
Sorry to bother you.

452
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:36,466
Do you have a light?
Mine crapped out on me.

453
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,403
The perils of technology.

454
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,571
It's 1969 and you're
unable to make fire.

455
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,640
Human error.
Forgot to fill it.

456
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:47,612
You're the only one here.
It's lunchtime.

457
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:51,181
- I'm not hungry.
- Probably have too much to do.

458
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:53,350
I'm not doing anything.

459
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:56,054
Look, I don't want
to put you out,

460
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:57,088
but if you have
a second--

461
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,226
I have an advertising question.

462
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,833
Go ahead.

463
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:08,203
Advertising--
does it work?

464
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:10,504
On some people.

465
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:13,974
It helps to have
a good product.

466
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:15,642
I'll tell you how great it is.

467
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,812
I started LeaseTech
with two old friends,

468
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,284
and six months later,
we have 19 new employees

469
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,552
and three new competitors.

470
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:26,121
Well, the first question

471
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:28,691
is how is what
you're selling unique?

472
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:31,293
IBM's leases
are short and expensive

473
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:33,160
because they're always
replacing the equipment

474
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:34,727
with the newest model.

475
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:36,529
Ours are cheaper
because we don't do that.

476
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,531
Don't yours become obsolete?

477
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,900
They all become
obsolete eventually.

478
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:43,570
The question is,
how long does that take?

479
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:46,742
IBM doesn't care because
they just sell new machines.

480
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,277
At this point, I usually ask,

481
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:52,315
"How did you get
into this business?"

482
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:55,451
Well, I was at IBM
for a few years.

483
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:57,385
- I knew it.
- Yes.

484
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,722
And I saw that they
have got a great product,

485
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,692
but they don't trust it.

486
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,759
I've worked
with these machines.

487
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:05,394
I know how resilient they are.

488
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:08,066
I don't want to find them
in a junkyard in two years.

489
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,337
So you're betting that
they'll last longer

490
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,472
- than even IBM thinks?
- Yeah.

491
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,743
But the problem is, so are a
bunch of other companies.

492
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:19,046
But they don't have you,

493
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,982
and they don't advertise.

494
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,452
Very nice.

495
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,821
What's IBM like?

496
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:31,258
Oh, there you are. I thought
we were going to lunch.

497
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,093
Thanks for the light.
Pleasure to talk to you.

498
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,563
You were going to give me the
name of a good keypunch service.

499
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,600
<i>( door closes )</i>

500
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:50,801
- When's Roger back from lunch?
- He's gone for the day.

501
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,846
- ( knocks )
- You got a second, Bert?

502
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,913
Of course.

503
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,717
LeaseTech--

504
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,623
the company that we're leasing
the computer from-- is a virgin.

505
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,358
And I think we should
prepare a presentation

506
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,825
while their guy is hanging around.
Push him over the edge.

507
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,994
New business?

508
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,764
That whole industry
is exploding.

509
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,533
This guy has
exponential growth.

510
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,536
Have you forgotten
the stipulations?

511
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,338
Fine, tell somebody else.

512
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,940
I mean, the apple
is right there.

513
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,444
You have a fundamental
misunderstanding

514
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,881
of what went wrong here.

515
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,549
So, that's it? You want
me to be a janitor?

516
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,517
Whistle while I work?

517
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:32,453
You thought
there was going to be

518
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,392
a big creative crisis and
we'd pull you off the bench,

519
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:38,895
but in fact, we've
been doing just fine.

520
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:41,698
So, why am I even here?
I could've gone anywhere.

521
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:44,602
- Why<i> are</i> you here?
- Because I started this agency!

522
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:47,607
Along with a dead man--
whose office you now inhabit.

523
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,358
I left something in there.

524
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,060
When?

525
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:20,340
Thank you, Caroline.
I got it.

526
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:42,739
( trickling )

527
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:54,888
What are you doing?

528
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,412
Are you looking
to buy some jelly?

529
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,913
The stand's up the road.

530
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:21,416
No, we're looking
for Margaret Sterling.

531
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,487
Hargrove.
Margaret Hargrove.

532
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,927
I know who
you're talking about.

533
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:29,497
Marigold?

534
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:32,869
She doesn't want any trouble,
and we don't want any trouble.

535
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,839
Nor do we.

536
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,673
These two are looking for you.

537
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,575
You know 'em?

538
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,412
Of course I do.

539
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,447
This is my mother and father.

540
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:49,522
- Mother, you look wonderful.
- Stop it.

541
00:29:49,556 --> 00:29:50,991
I know why you're here,

542
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:53,895
and I just want to welcome you.

543
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,071
Margaret, darling,
we just--

544
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,641
Could you call off your dogs?

545
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:07,577
I'd like to have
a private conversation.

546
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:10,380
Hey, everybody, I understand
the dry cleaning's ready,

547
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:11,749
but can you bring it
back in an hour?

548
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,518
There's 50 bucks in it for you.

549
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:16,820
I'm fine, everyone.
These are my parents.

550
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:27,706
Will you let me show
you around at least,

551
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:31,078
before you start railing against
something you don't understand?

552
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:33,449
I don't know what happened
between you and Brooks,

553
00:30:33,484 --> 00:30:35,285
but your son misses you.

554
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,587
Things have never been better
between me and Brooks.

555
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,520
Ever.

556
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,856
And...

557
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:45,493
I miss Ellery so much.

558
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,328
I think about him all the time,

559
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:51,269
but he can't be happy
if I'm not happy.

560
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:53,203
I didn't know how dire it was,

561
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:56,003
but if you need money, whatever
you want, whatever you need.

562
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,741
She doesn't want money.
Margaret, listen.

563
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:04,344
Sugarplum, these people
are lost and on drugs,

564
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:06,146
and they have
venereal diseases.

565
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,683
That's not for you.

566
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:09,885
You don't know them.

567
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,853
And I'm tired of accepting

568
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:15,057
society's definition of me.

569
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,258
I don't pray to that anymore.

570
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,726
Darling, I understand.

571
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,861
Being a young mother
can be overwhelming,

572
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:24,529
even with help.

573
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,798
You sit with your child
at the end of the day

574
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:28,933
and you're exhausted

575
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:31,069
and you don't even know
what you did.

576
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:33,504
And everything you do
seems wrong.

577
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,838
It's hard to accept that
those are the definitions,

578
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:37,474
but they are.

579
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,512
I'm sorry you had
nothing to live for.

580
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:43,282
I did. I had you,
and I was grateful.

581
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:45,583
I'm grateful.

582
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:47,320
I don't have to lock
myself in a bathroom

583
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:49,290
with a pint of gin every day.

584
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,025
I ought to slap you.

585
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,560
Why are you talking
to your mother like that?

586
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:56,365
Daddy, I'm-- I'm sorry.

587
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm telling her the truth,

588
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,868
and she doesn't
want to hear it.

589
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:02,002
Let's go!

590
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:08,047
You didn't even
let me talk to her.

591
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,915
There's no more point
in talking.

592
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:12,149
I'd think she was brainwashed,
but there's nothing to wash.

593
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:14,787
You can't make her turn on a dime.
You'll embarrass her.

594
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:17,692
Fine. You want to wine and
dine the account, Roger?

595
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:19,392
Knock yourself out.

596
00:32:19,426 --> 00:32:21,092
There's a four-year-old
in Manhattan

597
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:22,426
crying himself to sleep.

598
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,327
I'll get "Cletus"
to drive me to the train.

599
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,100
( door slams, engine starts )

600
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:44,542
Marigold!

601
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:46,543
You want to show me around?

602
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,903
( sighs )

603
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:55,576
<i>( hammering )</i>

604
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,047
<i>( saw whirring )</i>

605
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,512
Hey, it's Don.

606
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,514
Look at that, I got you.

607
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:26,115
I didn't know where you'd be.

608
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:28,150
You're here, there, everywhere.

609
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:32,356
No, I'm not in the bag.
I'm in the office.

610
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:36,159
Listen, let's go to Shea.

611
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:40,328
Let's go see a game, I mean it.

612
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:42,297
Is there a game today?

613
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,633
You shouldn't have
told me that,

614
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,537
because now we're really going.

615
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:49,739
Okay. Your wish is my command.
I will not move.

616
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,277
Can I hang up the phone?

617
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,413
( chuckles )

618
00:34:03,722 --> 00:34:05,956
( groans )

619
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:11,662
When you're done with that,

620
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,230
one of us should
find some firewood.

621
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:16,030
When he's done with that,
he's not going to be able

622
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:18,567
to find his ass
with both hands.

623
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,237
I'll tell you what, Clay,

624
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,773
why don't we switch jobs?

625
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:24,409
You want to get firewood,
help yourself.

626
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:26,009
There's no hierarchy, man.

627
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,478
Believe me, there's
always a hierarchy.

628
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:31,316
We do things
by true consensus here.

629
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,116
If we can't all agree
on something,

630
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,916
we think of something else.

631
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:38,422
Everyone does what they want.

632
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,224
Good.

633
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,525
Because I haven't felt
this at one with nature

634
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,060
since I was in the Navy.

635
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,136
Go ahead, it's dynamite grass.

636
00:34:51,604 --> 00:34:54,470
Now, I see why
we're eating so early.

637
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,805
No, it's because

638
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,606
we follow the cycles
of the Earth.

639
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,273
It's gonna get dark.

640
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,905
Electricity and all that?

641
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,677
It just brings problems.

642
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:08,579
But you've got a truck.

643
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:11,546
Yeah.

644
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,848
That's been up for debate, man.

645
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:16,954
Doesn't it get cold up here?

646
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,958
Margaret:
We light a campfire.

647
00:35:22,926 --> 00:35:25,897
And there's other ways
to keep warm.

648
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,468
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's expecting me.

649
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:38,974
Freddy, what
a pleasant surprise.

650
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,848
- You know you called me.
- I sure do.

651
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,115
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- Who?

652
00:35:45,149 --> 00:35:48,152
I want you to...
♪ meet the Mets ♪

653
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:51,826
Meet the Mets!
♪ Step right up and greet the Mets. ♪

654
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,360
Great idea.
Can you walk?

655
00:36:02,472 --> 00:36:04,004
Hello again.

656
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,239
Meredith, we're off
for the day.

657
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:09,875
- Way off.
- Okay. You two have fun.

658
00:36:11,277 --> 00:36:13,346
<i>( saw buzzing )</i>

659
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:17,719
Where are you going?

660
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:20,388
<i>( hammer rapping )</i>

661
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,660
Don, I didn't hear you.

662
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:27,460
No, I didn't hear you.

663
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:30,063
Come on, Don, we're
gonna miss the game.

664
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,005
You talk like a friend,
but you're not.

665
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,341
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

666
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,941
I know your name.

667
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:44,643
It's Lloyd.
I told you.

668
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:46,844
No, you go by many names.

669
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:49,847
I know who you are.

670
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,616
Don, let's go.

671
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,118
Why don't you listen
to your friend?

672
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:55,319
You don't need a campaign.

673
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:57,520
You've had the best campaign
since the dawn of time.

674
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:01,889
Pull yourself together.

675
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,529
Freddy?

676
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:11,365
We're knocking off early.

677
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,134
- Okay.
- Ball game.

678
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:20,545
I just wanted to make sure you
saw the memo from the partners.

679
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,716
Your raise was approved.
Congratulations.

680
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,518
What?

681
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,392
Oh, yes-- thank you.
This office is so great.

682
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:31,397
Everyone can just drop by
on their way out.

683
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,833
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

684
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:36,336
Joan!

685
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,171
I'm sorry.
I'm just having a day.

686
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:43,873
I have exactly two minutes.

687
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,878
It won't take that long.

688
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:48,181
You already know the problem.

689
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:50,215
Burger Chef's a big account,

690
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,182
but they obviously thought
you were ready for it.

691
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:54,148
They didn't want to give me
Burger Chef.

692
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:55,883
They wanted to give me Don.

693
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:57,553
What are you talking about?

694
00:37:57,587 --> 00:37:59,322
You didn't hear?

695
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:01,324
Lou put Don on my team.

696
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,560
To cowardice.

697
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:05,262
Mine or theirs?

698
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,541
He owes me work, and he's
going to the ball game?

699
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:17,245
And there's nothing I can
do, and he knows that.

700
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:20,212
Have you told Lou?
You don't know this,

701
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:23,085
but there were rules
set for Don.

702
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,787
- Is he breaking them?
- I don't know.

703
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,260
( sighs )

704
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:33,399
So, they just
dropped it in my lap,

705
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:35,731
hoping one of us would fail.

706
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:41,943
Well, Peggy, I don't know if
this makes you feel better,

707
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:44,412
but I don't think they
thought about it at all.

708
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,652
Roger: I can't believe my
little "princess and the pea"

709
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:53,089
is sleeping like this.

710
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,561
You never even wanted
to go camping.

711
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:57,463
Margaret:
Well...

712
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:02,140
I used to think
the country was lonely.

713
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,176
Now I realize the city is.

714
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:08,044
I mean, look at that.

715
00:39:11,886 --> 00:39:14,487
It's beautiful.

716
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,652
You think we'll put
a man up there?

717
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:19,024
With all the brainpower
around here?

718
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:22,496
I'm certain you'll put
a man on the roof.

719
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,664
I'd like to go to the moon.

720
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,837
Well, I guess if you can make
an allowance for a truck,

721
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,205
you can make an allowance
for a rocket.

722
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,175
Don't you want to go?

723
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,044
Of course.

724
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,279
Every little boy
wants to be an astronaut.

725
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,348
Astronauts didn't exist
when you were a little boy.

726
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,854
Jules Verne--

727
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:47,020
"From the Earth
to the Moon."

728
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:50,188
You read that to me.

729
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,659
They shot a cannon into space.

730
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:55,830
I don't think so.

731
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:57,664
Must've been your mother.

732
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,615
I'm really happy here, Daddy.

733
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:17,053
I know.

734
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:37,743
Oop, oop...

735
00:40:37,777 --> 00:40:39,679
Get my binoculars.
They're in the hallway closet.

736
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:41,581
Good idea.

737
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:45,615
We're going to miss
the national anthem.

738

It's as black and strong

744
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,669
Thank you.

745
00:41:38,671 --> 00:41:40,705
How'd you get in?

746
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,208
I'm glad you passed out.
I got a lot less to explain.

747
00:41:46,144 --> 00:41:48,712
Did the Mets win?

748
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:53,683
What the hell are you doing?

749
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:55,318
Aren't they giving you
a second chance?

750
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:57,554
They weren't serious about it.

751
00:41:57,588 --> 00:41:59,822
They finally gave me
something to do,

752
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:03,192
and it was write
25 tags for Peggy.

753
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:06,562
- What's the account?
- Burger Chef.

754
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:09,331
Hm-- Peggy.

755
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:11,366
Have you been
to the restaurant yet?

756
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,169
What, and have some pimply kid

757
00:42:14,203 --> 00:42:16,371
who should be writing taglines
hand me a milk shake?

758
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,638
How would you rather have it?

759
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:19,373
Would you rather be
in my situation--

760
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:20,875
bouncing from office to office?

761
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,177
"Ding-dong,
Don Draper calling."

762
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:24,711
I want my job back.

763
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:26,213
How the hell do you think
that's going to happen

764
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,648
when you're at
the bottom of a bottle?

765
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:30,550
You know you never have to
have another drink again.

766
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:32,485
I don't want to hear
that right now.

767
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,587
You're hungover. It's the
best time to hear it.

768
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,591
I mean, are you
just going to kill yourself?

769
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,926
Give them what they want?

770
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:43,862
Or go in your bedroom,
get in uniform,

771
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:47,232
fix your bayonet,
and hit the parade?

772
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:50,101
Do the work, Don.

Where's my daughter?

776
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,025
She's probably at the
creek getting water.

777
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,327
I don't think so.

778
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,935
It's a beautiful night
and a beautiful morning.

779
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,405
Did you see the sunrise?

780
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:30,747
It's a beautiful
morning, isn't it?

781
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:32,449
It's time to leave
Shangri-La, baby.

782
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,952
Take a good look, say
goodbye to your friends.

783
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,954
You were doing so well, Daddy.

784
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:38,723
Fine, you don't want to say goodbye?
Let's go.

785
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:41,426
Hey, man, leave her be.

786
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,962
Come on, Sprout, feel like
driving the truck today?

787
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,032
No one's going to help you
take me away from here.

788
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:49,201
They know this is
where I want to be.

789
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,769
I don't care what you want, and
I don't care what they want.

790
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:52,704
It's over.
Let's go.

791
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,241
I don't know why I assumed
you were more open-minded.

792
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:58,144
Well, I'm not. I
understand the temptation,

793
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,112
and I know everyone your
age is running away

794
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:02,782
and screwing around, but you can't.
You're a mother.

795
00:44:02,816 --> 00:44:06,119
- Ellery has everything he needs.
- He needs his mother.

796
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:08,422
I'm sorry, but you
don't get to do this!

797
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,523
Goodbye, Daddy.

Your conscience must
have been eating you alive.

Calling your secretary
from a hotel

806
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:44,925

present for me?

I'm sure you were<i> sick.</i>

808
00:44:48,196 --> 00:44:50,998
