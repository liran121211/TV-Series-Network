wants a toaster

- Can you freshen this?
- Yeah.

And Abigail wasn't shy.

- That's your mother?
- Stepmother.

50
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,400
So she put the toaster

and all the boarders come
down for breakfast, see it.

They weren't
particularly impressed.

53

And every day one of them
would trip over that wire

- Get up, I want my seat back.

59

Now, toasters were
indestructible back then,

My Uncle Mack was cheap and
thought he could fix things.

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,385
So he wrapped a piece
of copper wire around it.

64
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:16,470
And, sure enough,
he plugged it in

65
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,522
and it blew him
into the parlor.

66
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,475
- He was unconscious.
- ( laughing )

00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,111
All the boarders got up,
ran to his aid,

68
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,646
but Abigail didn't move.

69
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,899
She just looked down
at him and said,

70
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,984
- "Happy birthday."
- ( laughing )

71
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,986
Then put the kettle on.

72
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,956
He loves to tell stories
about how poor he was.

73
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,407
But he's not anymore.

74
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,242

want me to get the check?

Hey, Mildred Pierce,

That's $100.

00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,373

00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,124

They're crap.

00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,827
They're definitely not
as high-quality as Topaz.

133
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,612
Well, they're in

And they're outselling
you 20 to one.

136
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,203
It's more than the packaging.
It's the placement.

137
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,871
They're not just selling
them in drug stores.

138
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,706
They're focusing
on supermarkets.

139
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,758
And they're only
$1.39 a pair.

140
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,678
So what, we need to lower our price
and buy more ad time?

141
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,098
This is only a novelty and the inferior
quality will catch up with them.

142
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,267
But we're recommending
a change right now

143
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,186
while it sorts itself out.

00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,438
Look, I know
you think I'm cheap.

145
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,390
And I know you think
Topaz are cheap--

146
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,309
although, apparently,
not cheap enough--

147
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,313
but I just want to spend money
where it'll make a difference.

148
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,733
They got an egg.
Why don't we have a topaz?

149
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,819
Big plastic jewel.
Green.

150
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,287
Maybe it's see-through.

151

And Mr. Potato Head
here can relax

152
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,908
'cause he'll still make his
quota when we launch it.

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,245
I'd never recommend
imitation as a strategy.

154
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,298
You'll be second,
which is very far from first.

155
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,749
Whose fault is that?

156
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,886
I told you about the
development of this product

157
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,721
and you didn't seem
worried at all.

158

163
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,744
We keep the client.

164
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,531
How was the party?

David Bailey wants

00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,620
Well, I have plans tonight,

167
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,623

00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,426
- Wake me in--

169
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:40,928
Great.

00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,639
You have lunch plans?

171
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,108
Just coffee
if the wait's not too long.

172
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,815
No, I just thought I'm going
to the coffee shop,

173
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,701
so I could pick
you up something.

174
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,569
Mathis, you're pouring coffee.

175
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,821
I just wanted to ask you
about something.

176
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,124
You want a raise?
Stop acting like a secretary.

177
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,326
This has nothing
to do with work.

178
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,328
My brother-in-law
is in town

179
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,132
and I thought you could
join Julie and I for dinner.

180
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,502
He's very handsome.
The whole family is.

181
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,588
- You're setting me up?
- He has a car.

182
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,475
It's very sweet, but I really have to
question your judgment.

183
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,594
You know, you're a catch.

184
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:34,682
Thank you, but how could you think
this has nothing to do with work?

185
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,685
I told my wife that and she
said it wouldn't matter

186
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,320
because she has
a knack for this.

187
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,356
What happens if I take
you up on this offer

188
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,326
and it goes badly
or he's homely

189
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,611
or anything happens
good or bad?

190
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,113
Did you think about that?

191
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,082
No, I didn't anticipate
any of this,

192
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll be honest with you.

193
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,670
I appreciate it,
but no, thank you.

194
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,505
Tell Julie
she's very thoughtful.

195
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,966
Are you auditioning?

196
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,884
I tried to arrange a meeting,

197
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,721
but Meredith explained
how much work you have to do.

198
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:21,145
We met with Topaz and had the
unpleasant conversation.

199
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:25,532
And their solution was a
knockoff topaz container, green.

200
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,068
What was our solution?

201
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,455
We don't have one.

202
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,541
The irony is they're being pushed
out of the bottom of the market.

203
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,377
What's the top of the market,
department stores?

204
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,078
Yeah, but they're
a drug store brand.

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,546
That's what Topaz is.

206
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,668
So they're not called
Topaz anymore.

207
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,304
Tell them their idea
for new packaging was good,

208
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,506
but the new packaging
should say Macy's.

209
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,725
That's going to be tough
when department stores

210
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,428
are being blown up by radicals every day.
You know these two.

211
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,230
People haven't
stopped shopping.

212
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,565
So all I have to do
is sign Macy's.

213
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,933
Piece of cake.

214
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,771
Doesn't McCann represent
Marshall Field's?

215
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,191
Remind them
it's a two-way street.

216
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,947
Phil was in plastics
and he's going to metals.

217
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,033
And Greg was in metals
and he's going to

218
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,085
marketing and advertising,
which is my old job.

219
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,037
That means that Tom Schaeffer

220
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,873
is now head of plastics
at Dow Chemical.

221
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,591
Good for him.

222
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,293
Good for you.

223
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,213
Now's a good time.

224
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,215
He's still not up.

225
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,433
Oh.

226
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,101
Never wake a sleeping baby.

227
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,636
I want to see him.

228
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,057
Oh, what's that?

229
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,309
We don't want you to think
of this as retirement,

230
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,229
we want you to think of it as the
beginning of your professional career.

231
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,614
I don't know what to say.

232
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,783
You say, "Jack Nicklaus,
out of my way.

233
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,318
I've got better clubs."

234
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,487
- <i> ( laughs )</i>
- I'm very touched.

235
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,323
Ever since your mother
passed away,

236
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:59,243
I haven't really
enjoyed anything.

237
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:02,246
Honestly, Ed.
He thinks he's a comedian.

238
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,547
( chuckles )

239
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,165
I'm just glad there's something

240
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,000
that will get him out of the
house besides that boat.

241
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,669
Who says I'm going
to be in the house?

242
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,587
I've got a lot of time
to make up for.

243
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,006
Daddy, I'm so glad.

244
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,642
I mean, most of the men my age have
had a couple of heart attacks.

245
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,845
I'm still young enough
to enjoy things.

246
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,480
New things, even.

247
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,348
I've started cooking.

248
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,318
Actually made myself a--
what is it, honey?

249
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,520
A Pop-Tart, Ed.

250
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,522
It was very good.

251
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,077
Next.

252
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,113
This is another girl.

253
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,509
Rachel?

254
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm supposed to tell you
you missed your flight.

255
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,982
Thank you.

256
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,905
Rachel.

257
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,491
Yes?

258
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,327
You're not just smooth,

259
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,246
you're Wilkinson smooth.

260
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,668
Back to work.

261
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,396
Is it morning?

262
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:47,985
No.

263
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,903
Go back to sleep.

264
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,361
( TV playing )

265
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,783
Sorry, did I wake you?

266
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,452
It's okay.
Did Eddie wake up again?

267
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,927
My dad is so old.

268
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,130
Don't worry about him.

269
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,849
He is going to have a ball.

270
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,885
Why did he wait
so long to do that?

271
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,021
Honey, he loved his job.

272
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,473
But you don't.

273
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,643
You're bored and angry because
you know in your heart

274
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,111
it's not what you want to do.

275
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,896
I should never
tell you anything.

276
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,616
And I haven't gotten any
writing done in a long time.

277
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,951
So start now.

278
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,820
You've done very well.

279
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,156
And let's stop pretending like
I wasn't born with plenty.

280
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,158
You could quit your job.

281
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,160
We could buy that farm.

282
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,496
You could write your book.

283
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,048
What book?

284
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,835
Something sad and sweet.

285
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,921
For all the people who don't have
the guts to live their dream.

286
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:59,590
Why don't you write a book?

287
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,593
You gave them your eye.

288
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,344
Don't give them
the rest of your life.

289
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,264
Your father was a cog
in a giant machine

290
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,815
that makes weapons and poison.

291
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,852
- And you sell them.
- <i> ( baby crying )</i>

292
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm proud of the company!

293
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,608
And if nothing else, I'd like to
wait and see if I get that raise.

294
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,694
There's always another hurdle.

295
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,863
You're not listening
to me at all!

296
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,951
( sighs )

297
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:30,754
- You're late.
- It's five after.

298
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,373
Casting always starts on time.

299
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,175
Can't you smell
the cheap perfume?

300
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,130
Can you call Rachel Katz
at Menken's Department Store?

301
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,049
No, you know what?
Set a meeting.

302
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,266
The number's in the Rolodex.

303
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,601
It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.

304
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,470
Of course.

305
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,776
Well, you're not the
landing party we expected.

306
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,113
What can we do for you?

307
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,116
Well, as I was telling
David here on the phone,

308
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,902
L'eggs Pantyhose
is an unstoppable foe

309
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,488
in the affordable
pantyhose marketplace.

310
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,624
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,
has the high quality

311
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,743
to wear
a department store name.

312
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,549
It is a growing
and lucrative product.

313
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,968
And in three months,
L'eggs has sold a year's worth.

314
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,471
So they're worried that L'eggs are
gonna spread all over the world?

315
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,223
That wouldn't bother me at all.

316
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,509
( laughing )

317
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,394
We were hoping
that McCann-Erickson

318
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,147
could provide, at the minimum,
an introduction

319
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,099
to your department
store clients

320
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,901
so we can assess their
desire for a store brand.

321
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,820
I know they'd be
happy to meet you.

322
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,740
Especially Dan Higgins.
He loves redheads.

323
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,442
Would you be able to tell him

324
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,861
what's so special
about your panties?

325
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:47,948
The benefits are listed there.

326
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,200
But, basically,
they're more sheer,

327
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,286
softer, and more
like silk to the touch,

328
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,788
yet still very strong.

329
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,923
So you can pull them
down over and over?

330
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,041
( chuckles )

331
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,509
You can wear them
quite a few times

332
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,678
before they run or lose shape.

333
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,213
Oh.

334
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:06,433
- Do you wear them, Joan?
- I do.

335
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,052
Well, if you talk to Dan,
I'd start with that.

336
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:10,604
( laughing )

337
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,142
Well, I think anyone
would be equally interested

338
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,893
in the price-per-unit,

339
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,613
which could be reduced significantly
if the demand were higher.

340
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,732
Why aren't you in
the brassiere business?

341
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,567
Excuse me?

342
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,486
You should be
in the bra business.

343
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,288
You're a work of art.

344
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:33,160
What she's saying
is that wider distribution

345
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,245
would mean bigger
ad budgets for us.

346
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,332
Well, I'd set a lunch,
but I think a dinner would be better.

347
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,134
And warm him up first.

348
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,336
Send a basket of pears
to Marshall Field's.

349
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:45,756
The one thing Dan likes
is a nice pear.

350
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,724
( laughs )

351
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,093
This guy.

352
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,511
What are their billings?

353
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,014
If you'd take a look
at the sheet there again...

354
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,732
Oh, yeah.
Give us a minute.

355
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,651
Let's read this thing.

356
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:09,644
Where were you?

357
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,396
Shirley, you're not
gonna believe this,

358
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,897
but I walked to work today.

359
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,483
Mr. Sterling
and Mr. Donnelly are here.

360
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,118
They just walked in.

361
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,825
You wanted to see me?

362
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,910
You know Ferguson Donnelly
from McCann.

363
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,662
Of course. Ferg.

364
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,297
- Good to see you.
- Been a while.

365
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,503
Is this about the Topaz
department store route?

366
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,088
I think it's a great idea.

367
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,424
I don't know what
you're talking about.

368
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:43,061
Did you send Ed Baxter a $200 set of
MacGregor golf clubs from the firm?

369
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,896
Actually,
I hand-delivered it.

370
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,397
It was a retirement gift.

371
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,816
Huh, well, I've got
some bad news for you.

372
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,102
Pete's gonna take over Dow.

373
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,520
Because of the clubs?

374
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,189
No, because McCann doesn't
want you on the business.

375
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:57,859
Just because Ed's retiring

376
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,194
doesn't mean I can't get
along with his replacement.

377
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,863
I know Greg from metals.

378
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,365
I don't care if you know
a girl from Kalamazoo.

379
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,867
We don't want you
on the business

380
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,869
because we don't want
you on any business.

381
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,205
Look, Ferg,

382
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,840
you're not still mad
at me for leaving?

383
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,510
That was six years ago.
And you never hired me anyway.

384
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,346
When you bought Puttnam Powell &
Lowe, I came with the furniture.

385
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,215
People come in and out of our
doors all the time, Ken,

386
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,302
but they don't walk out with $4
million of Birds Eye products.

387
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:26,137
Of course they do.

388
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,855
Fine.

389
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:30,274
They don't walk around the office
like their shit doesn't stink.

390
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,393
And then go out and tell
the world we're what,

391
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,812
a bunch of black Irish thugs.

392
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:38,366
So you're gonna fire me because
I hurt Ferg's feelings?

393
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,151
It's what he is.
Look at him.

394
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,903
How about a little dignity?

395
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,237
You're firing me!

396
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,790
Yes, but you're gonna get
a generous severance package

397
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,742
if you help Pete secure
all of your accounts.

398
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,293
Including Dow.

399
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,579
Roger said he'd be glad
to recommend you.

400
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:55,083
Thank you, Roger.
I appreciate your loyalty.

401
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,556
<i>( door slams )</i>

402
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,391
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

403
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,315
Should we get lunch?

404
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,268
I want to burn this place down.

405
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,904
I know.
They were awful.

406
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,407
But at least we got a yes.

407
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,943
Would you have rather
had a friendly no?

408
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,946
I don't expect you
to understand.

409
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:29,083
Joan, you've never
experienced that before?

410
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,369
Have you, Peggy?

411
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,921
I don't know.
You can't have it both ways.

412
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:37,008
- You can't dress the way you do and expect--
- How do I dress?

413
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:40,128
Look, they didn't take
me seriously, either.

414
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,880
So what you're saying is

415
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:45,099
I don't dress the way you do

416
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:48,019
because I don't look like you.

417
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:51,105
And that's very, very true.

418
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:56,110
You know what?
You're filthy rich.

419
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,112
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

420
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,983
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

421
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,321
How was the cattle call?

422
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,207
We have to have
another session.

423
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:12,076
You're shameless,
you know that?

424
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,494
Do I have a lunch today?

425
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,963
No, but you have
a busy afternoon.

426
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,666
Oh, I scheduled
a meeting next Monday

427
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,002
with Mr. Rosenthal at
Menken's Department Store.

428
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:23,671
Mrs. Katz didn't
want to meet?

429
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:27,642
Well, it was a very
awkward conversation

430
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,728
because apparently she stepped
down a few months ago

431
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,097
and passed away last week.

432
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,650
What?

433
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,769
Rachel Katz?

434
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,855
Yes.

435
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:43,157
Well, I'm sorry
to tell you that.

436
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,776
Last week?

437
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:55,620
I had no intention
of upsetting you.

438
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,338
How old was she?

439
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,926
I don't know.
Younger than me.

440
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,047
From the name I just
pictured some old lady.

441
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:08,049
I had no idea.

442
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:15,306
If you'd like, they've asked
that in lieu of flowers,

443
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:18,943
you can send a donation to the
National Jewish Hospital at Denver.

444
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,561
Do you want to do that?

445
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:25,066
No.

446
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,034
Yes, sure.

447
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,455
I'm going to run down
and get you a sandwich.

448
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,878

<i>( radio playing )</i>

450
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,133
I'm shoving off.
Need anything else?

451
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,584
No.

452
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,805
Ahem, Mathis.

453
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,507
Yes?

454
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,728
Well, if it helps you get back
into your wife's good graces,

455
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,763
I had a cancellation

456
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:58,349
and I'd love to join you
for dinner tomorrow night.

457
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,768
Shoot, we already
made other plans.

458
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,070
Oh.

459
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,774
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

460
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:09,527
Stevie doesn't need to come with us.
I'll sell his ticket.

461
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,445
Stevie?
How old is he?

462
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,080
I don't know, 30?

463
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,868
- I don't know.
- Ugh, can I go?

464
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:21,172
Give him my number.
Tell him to call me.

465
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,790
Okay.

466
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,107
- You want a menu?
- Just coffee.

467
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,809
And could you get
her attention for me?

468
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,279
Di, just coffee for him.

469
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,623
Evening.

470
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,491
Can I help you?

471
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:00,795
You look so familiar to me.

472
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,747
Do I know you from somewhere?

473
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,249
Yes, from here.
The other night.

474
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,168
No.

475
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,337
I think I know you.

476
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,757
You don't need a line.
I know why you're here.

477
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:15,476
And it's not for
a cup of coffee.

478
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,848
Vi, I'm taking my break.

479
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,344
My name is Don.

480
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:55,693
Excuse me, miss.

481
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,862
When are you done here?

482
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:00,414
You got your $100's worth.

483
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,032
You can go.

484
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,800
- Woman: Have fun last night?
- Woman #2: Yes, I did.

485
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,136
He's very handsome,
I'll tell you that much.

486
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,389
Ken:
<i>Don. Don.</i>

487
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:27,681
- Are you okay?
- I'm done.

488
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:31,151
McCann told Roger to do it.

489
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,937
And, boy, did Roger do it.

490
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:36,023
They want me to giftwrap all my
accounts and give them to Pete.

491
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,325
I'm calling Jim Hobart
right now.

492
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:40,361
You're the head of accounts.

493
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:43,280
Do you want to hear
something spooky?

494
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,783
Don't do anything rash, Ken.

495
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:46,917
It's just a job.

496
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:49,920
No, my father-in-law
retires

497
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,206
and my wife says,
"I want you to quit.

498
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:55,592
You're wasting your life.
You should write that novel."

499
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:57,544
And you know what?

500
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,213
I think I was gonna do it.

501
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:02,549
And the very next day,
they fire me.

502
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,518
Can you believe that?

503
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:06,687
No.

504
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:08,605
That's not a coincidence.

505
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,107
That's a sign.

506
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,026
Of what?

507
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:13,894
The life not lived.

508
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,866
So that's good?

509
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:22,403
( laughs )
Yeah. It's great.

510
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:25,072
Now I just have to figure out

511
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,157
how to drag myself
through those doors.

512
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:40,254
Woman:<i> Joan, you have</i>
<i>a call from Dennis.</i>

513
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,723
- Dennis who?
- <i> I'm not sure.</i>

514
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:45,809
<i>His girl just said Dennis.</i>
<i>He's at McCann-Erickson.</i>

515
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:49,980
It's Dennis Ford.

516
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:52,066
<i>Should I put him through?</i>

517
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:55,486
No.

518
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,354
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

519
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,002
So Clara just left?

520
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,171
She was as big as a house.

521
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:16,256
Is Torkelson going
to marry her?

522
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,959
He's probably just
looking the other way.

523
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,295
People do that around
here all the time.

524
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:23,630
I swear I found out
after you did.

525
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:25,299
It came from McCann.

526
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,134
So did your millions
of dollars.

527
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:31,138
( sighs ) You know, I didn't
really get millions of dollars.

528
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,057
I mean, eventually,

529
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,059
but stepped out
in smaller increments

530
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,144
to stay under that
top tax threshold.

531
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:39,446
I might have to buy an apartment
building to hold onto any of it.

532
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:40,981
And then I've got
to be a landlord.

533
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,151
Sounds like a real
pain in the ass.

534
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:47,121
Look, I was caught by surprise.

535
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,540
But I didn't know
your history with McCann.

536
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:51,158
What did you do over there?

537
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:54,995
I never fit in.
I'm not Irish.

538
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,914
I'm not Catholic.
I can read.

539
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:00,050
( laughs )
Well, it's good you're playing ball

540
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:01,552
or you'd have no future.

541
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,170
In advertising maybe.

542
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,838
You have other plans?

543
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,392
Well, I may have
let it go for a while,

544
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:12,096
but damned if I don't have
something to write about now.

545
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,815
No, this world is boring.

546
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,600
You should write
an adventure story.

547
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:20,187
I mean, do you know how great
you're gonna look on a book jacket?

548
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,940
I've thought about it.

549
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:25,659
I'm a hell of a lot better
at it than I ever was at this.

550
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,028
( chuckles )
Good for you.

551
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,997
I'm envious.

552
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,867
I thought I was really changing my
life when I went out to California.

553
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,837
Of course, now it sort
of feels like a dream.

554
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:39,256
But at the time,
it felt so real.

555
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:42,459
Well, that's you, I guess.

556
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,045
I know.
Look, here I am.

557
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,847
And you know what?

558
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:48,348
If you get tired
of the writing,

559
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:49,967
I hope you know
you can always use my name.

560
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,852
I have nothing but good
things to say about you.

561
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,556
I appreciate that.

562
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:58,058
Jesus, Fillmore Auto Parts?

563
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,444
You trying to give me stuff
we don't even have anymore?

564
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,584
This is the same
as the navy one.

565
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,419
Well, don't tell
Oscar de la Renta

566
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:28,172
because the navy one is $159.

567
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:30,174
I can wear boots with that.

568
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:33,677
You know what?
I'll take the boots

569
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,596
and the tan heels,

570
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:38,148
the chiffon, the red,

571
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,900
and this one.

572
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,237
Didn't you used to work here?

573
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:45,939
Because you can probably
still get the discount.

574
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,025
That's tempting,

575
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:51,161
but I think you have me
confused with someone else.

576
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:53,030
Could you?

577
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:02,422
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Meredith:<i> Ted wants to see you.</i>

578
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,177
Send him in.

579
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,464
Just got off the phone
with Wilkinson.

580
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,466
They've narrowed it
down to three girls.

581
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:13,967
They want me to send
over the binder,

582
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,353
but there's 120
Polaroids in here.

583
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:17,938
It's just gonna
make things worse.

584
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,690
What can I say?
They're perverts. They love casting.

585
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:23,193
They can't decide?
Use them all.

586
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:26,530
There are three women
in every man's life.

587
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,068
You did not just think that up.

588
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,819
Fine, I've had it for years,

589
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:34,321
but I really think
it works here.

590
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:36,957
You'd rather find new creative
than pick a girl?

591
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:40,210
Speaking of which, "Vogue" is throwing
a party in the Village tonight.

592
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:42,212
Cocktails at my apartment.
It's right around the corner.

593
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:44,965
Apparently, hemlines
are going up.

594
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,833
What time?

595
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:49,803
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

596
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,810
<i>( door closes )</i>

597
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,679
So, you're from Atlanta?

598
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,397
No, I just went
to school there.

599
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,516
Emory, it's the only
game in town.

600
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:03,734
How about you?

601
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,653
Me? Oh, no.
I didn't go to college.

602
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,156
I went right to work.
I was a secretary.

603
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,241
That's interesting.

604
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:12,826
Is it?

605
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:16,196
Ah, here we go.

606
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:20,701
Oh, this smells delicious.

607
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:23,954
It does.

608
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,006
Didn't you order lasagna?

609
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,958
This is just as good.

610
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,262
Do you want my cannelloni?
It's like lasagna.

611
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:34,548
More than veal, anyway.

612
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,383
Are you trying to make
this more complicated?

613
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:39,436
I don't know why you're eating
something you didn't order.

614
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,721
Do you like veal?

615
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:42,306
What am I supposed to do?

616
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:44,107
Send it back
like a prima donna?

617
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:46,810
So you're just gonna eat
someone else's dinner?

618
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:50,480
So I can either be a jerk
and send it back,

619
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:52,149
or eat it and look weak.

620
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:56,203
I don't want this to get cold.

621
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:58,238
( sighs )

622
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,541
Johnny said you were the kind of
girl who doesn't put up with things.

623
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:03,210
Really?

624
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,496
What else did Mathis say?

625
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:11,418
He said you were funny.

626
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,470
And that you were fearless.

627
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,564
I love veal.

628
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,738
( sighs )

629
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:49,387
<i>( quiet chatter )</i>

630
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,150
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

631
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,702
Should I take my shoes off?

632
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:07,238
No, that's just
for the mourners.

633
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,740
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

634
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,242
I worked with Rachel.

635
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:12,910
At the store?

636
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:14,495
I'm Barbara, her sister.

637
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,747
I'm Don Draper.
I'm in advertising.

638
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:20,418
Oh.

639
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,420
I know who you are.

640
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,840
Excuse me, do you mind?

641
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,425
We need one more
for our minyan.

642
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,926
I'd be glad to help.

643
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:31,345
He can't.
He's not Jewish.

644
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:34,598
Okay.
I'll go and knock on some doors.

645
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,851
You shouldn't do it.
Let one of them do it.

646
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,769
Barbara, they're my neighbors.

647
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:43,574
We're sitting shiva.

648
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,078
It's a seven-day memorial
period after the funeral.

649
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,330
I've lived in New York
a long time.

650
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:50,915
I brought cake.

651
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,118
You did.

652
00:35:57,457 --> 00:36:00,091
So, how is your family?

653
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,712
I got divorced.

654
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:07,298
And I got remarried, actually.

655
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,799
You left your wife for her?

656
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:11,635
No, it didn't
work out that way.

657
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,556
I'm actually getting
divorced again.

658
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,692
I'm sorry.

659
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,816
Are those her children?

660
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,953
Yes.

661
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:31,489
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

662
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,158
Years ago.
Before them.

663
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,131
What happened to her?

664
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,001
She had leukemia.

665
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:56,430
I'm sorry. I don't know what
you're looking for here.

666
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:59,483
I guess I just wanted to find out
what was happening in her life.

667
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,686
She lived the life
she wanted to live.

668
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:05,022
She had everything.

669
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:09,160
Good.

670
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:11,195
I have to help.
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,370
( speaking Hebrew )

672
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,470
Johnny Mathis.

673
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,722
How many times has he shown up

674
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,559
and people have been
disappointed?

675
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,444
"You are not
Johnny Mathis."

676
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,813
( laughing )
I've never thought of that.

677
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,567
You don't seem like a lawyer.

678
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,536
Well, I just left
a firm in Boston

679
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,071
because they felt the same way.

680
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:00,244
I once quit a job because
I wanted to go to Paris.

681
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,379
Do they do that in advertising?

682
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:06,133
Sure. We shoot commercials
abroad all the time.

683
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,918
Well, some people do.

684
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,255
So all you have to do
is write something in Paris

685
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:12,923
and you can go.
Am I wrong?

686
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:16,510
Yes. That's not
how it works.

687
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:18,729
Well, next vacation.

688
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,101
I haven't taken a vacation...

689
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:27,271
well, never.

690
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,443
You know what?
Let's go.

691
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,662
Sure. Where?

692
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:37,248
To Paris.

693
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,949
Let's go to Paris.

694
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:40,534
Right now.

695
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:45,422
You think you're
kidding around,

696
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,259
- but I don't have a job.
- I'm not kidding.

697
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,679
Okay. I'm getting
the check.

698
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:53,464
And I'm getting my coat.

00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:59,219
( laughing )

700
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,473
I can't find it.

701
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,275
I've never actually used it.

702
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,226
You've never used
your passport?

703
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,792
- Stop.
- What? Why?

704
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,744
Flight's not till 6:00.

705
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,296
I hate to disappoint you,

706
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,880
but I don't need
that much time.

707
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,716
( laughs )

708
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:32,886
I can't believe this.

709
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,172
I can't find my passport.

710
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:39,059
It's okay.
This is a romantic spot.

711
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:43,180
Stevie.

712
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:45,316
( sighs )
I'm sorry,

713
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,818
but what were we
going to do in Paris?

714
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,522
I thought you were a fling,

715
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:56,160
but now I think
maybe you're more.

716
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:59,163
I don't want to sleep with you
on the night we first met.

717
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:01,198
That's so old-fashioned.

718
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,536
I've tried new-fashioned.

719
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:07,204
( sighs )

720
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:08,872
Well, if I have to go
back to Boston...

721
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,457
I don't even know
if I'm going to get this job.

722
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:14,511
Don't you worry.
I am going to find that passport.

723
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,464
We can go next weekend.

724
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:21,135
I have an interview
in DC next weekend.

725
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:22,853
How about the weekend after?

726
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,555
Perfect.

727
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:28,559
You really want me to go now?

728
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,897
Just call me when you
get back from DC.

729
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:43,323
I will.

730
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:45,075
Good.

<i>10 days ago with my report to</i>
<i>the nation on Vietnam,</i>

734
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:17,635
I announced the decision
to withdraw

735
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:20,304
an additional 150,000 Americans

736
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:23,040
from Vietnam
over the next year.

737
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:27,245
<i>I said then that I was</i>
<i>making that decision</i>

738
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:31,282

741
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,052
I've secured Birds Eye.

742
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:54,054
I think Ferguson Donnelly
is one happy man.

743
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:56,139
More like a man and a half.

744
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,810
As my father would say, he
really puts the mick in McCann.

745
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:02,896
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Woman:<i> Ken's here for the meeting.</i>

746
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:05,566
- Did you invite him?
- To this meeting?

747
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,569
Oh, hello, Pete.

748
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:11,822
Roger, I just wanted to let you know
I won't be collecting severance.

749
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:14,658
You got another job?
Good for you.

750
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,076
But you're still entitled.

751
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:17,828
It wouldn't be right.

752
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,831
My signing bonus from Dow is so big,
it feels like a second helping.

753
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,334
What the hell
are you talking about?

754
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:27,304
See, I wasn't just
Ed's son-in-law.

755
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,673
They actually value
their relationships.

756
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,059
Well, I suppose they need
a guy in fertilizer.

757
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:35,262

I'm taking Tom Schaeffer's old post.

Head of advertising.

759
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,400
So you're going to fire us?

760
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:43,270
No, it's going to be
way worse than that.

761
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:45,188
I'm going to be your client.

762
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,492
And I hate to tell you,
but I'm very hard to please.

763
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,030
Until we meet again.

764
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:00,037
Shit.

765
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,051
Taking Fleischmann's
Margarine to the studio.

766
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:15,719
If you want changes,
we got to talk now.

767
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,721
Sure, fine, just
keep your voice down.

768
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:20,057
I commandeered these.

769
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,643
Sounds like you had
quite a night.

770
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:23,977
It was nice.

771
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:25,729
With who?

772
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,948
She's going to Europe
with my brother-in-law.

773
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:30,284
You know, Julie and I went
to Paris on our honeymoon

774
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,735
if you need any
recommendations.

775
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,738
I don't know where I'm going,
but you have work to do.

Paris, huh?

778
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,798
Where margarine was invented.

779
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,583
Wow.

780
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,669
First date magic.

781
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:50,671
I had too much wine

782
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:53,056
and I totally
embarrassed myself.

783
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:55,225
Sounds like you
had a good time.

784
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,395
I'm not going to get on a plane
with somebody I barely know.

785
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,598
But you'd get to know him.
Sounds like fun.

786

( sighs )

787
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:05,652
It's nothing a couple
of Aspirin won't fix.

788
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,164
Meredith, I'm leaving
for the day.

789
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:24,788
I got a little research
for your meeting.

790
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,290
Mr. Rosenthal is first
thing Monday morning.

791
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,626
- Who?
- Mr. Rosenthal.

792
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:32,129
From Menken's Department Store.

793
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,714
Pantyhose.

794
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:38,552
Thank you.

795
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,962
I've got this.

796
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,631
Hello.

797
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,416
I don't know why you're here,

798
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,917
but that's not
going to happen again.

799
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,503
Wait.

800
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,005
What?

801
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,059
I...

802
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:22,646
had this dream about
a woman I once knew.

803
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,350
And I found out the next
day she had just died.

804
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,354
Is that who you think I am?

805
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:34,825
No, I don't think so.

806
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,327
Well, I want you
to think very carefully

807
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,829
about when you
really had that dream,

808
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:41,948
because when people die,
everything gets mixed up.

809
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,701
I don't know.
Maybe.

810
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,671
Maybe you dreamt
about her all the time.

811
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,874
Maybe.

812
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:54,544
When someone dies, you just
want to make sense out of it.

813
00:45:54,596 --> 00:45:57,047
But you can't.

814
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:04,888
I'm not saying this to lead you
on or make you more interested,

815
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,474
but the next time you come in
here, please bring a date.

816
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:10,777
I just work here.

817
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,231
I just want to sit here.

818
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:21,371
