- In gloves?

00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,906
I don't have a phone yet.

181
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,492
Fine, I'll come there.

182
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,923
Welcome.

183
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,644
Do you sleep like that?

184
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,262
I'm vain.

185
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,932
May I?

186
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,019
It's a very lovely apartment.

187
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,105
It's like
"Architectural Digest."

188
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,441
My...

189

She decorated it.

190
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,164
It's what I pictured.

191
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,282
So you were picturing it?

192
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,285
I took a cab to some
stranger's apartment

193
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,504
with $6 in my pocket.

194
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,923
I was hoping it was like this.

195
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,511
I'm gonna sell it.

196
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,966
I was just apartment hunting.
It's going to be hard to beat.

197
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,768
Can I fix you a drink?

198
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:34,773
I don't know how I feel
about getting to know you better.

199
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,524
It's 3:00 in the morning.

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,227
You know why you're here.
Do you want a drink or not?

201
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,983
I'm already drunk.

202
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,788
Would you like
a glass of water?

203
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,178
Hey, I can't sleep like this.

204
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,184
You were.

205
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,019
I don't want to.

206
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,272
Do you want to go?

207
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,861
No.

208
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,707
Are you really divorced?

209
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,710
Yes, I am.

210
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,846
Really. Why?

211
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,050
Got a lot of coats
in that closet.

212
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:55,053
She lives in California.
She didn't need them.

213
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,604
Do you want one?

214
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,775
I was going to go
to San Francisco.

215
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,393
I flipped a coin.

216
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,365
I always wanted to live here.

217
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,702
It was in all the movies,
all the magazines.

218
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,037
I haven't seen any of it.

219
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,706
It's a great city.

220
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,324
How long were you married?

221
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,411
12 years.

222
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,415
I don't know why
I thought it'd be easy.

223
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,334
It's never easy.

224
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,804
I've been through it before.

225
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,923
There's no children this time.

226
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,758
You?

227
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,844
No children.

228
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,020
( inhales )

229
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,156
You smell incredible.
What is that?

230
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,991
Shampoo.

231
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,946
Avon.

232
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
( sighs )

233
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,786
I bought it in my living room.

234
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,959
In my ranch house.

235
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,347
My two-car garage.

They're here
every other weekend.

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,155
Well, not my little girl. She's at
boarding school, but the boys come.

241
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,588
Are you okay?

242
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,807
No.

What's wrong?

244
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,651
I lied to you.

Already?

246
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,659
No, I left home because
I have a little girl.

00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,945
I had a little girl.

Oh.

00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,004
I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

Two years ago.

The flu.
Can you imagine?

254
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,552
I'm so sorry.

255
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:47,141
I don't want to talk about it.

256
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,561
Obviously,
I'm in New York City.

257
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,867
You should go.

258
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,287
It's my house.

259
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,041
Don't you have to
get ready for work?

260
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,333
I don't feel like it.

262
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,401
Gentlemen, I'm going
to be strict,

263
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,487
but this is Torkelson's law.

264
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,439
Take a good look.

265
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,275
You got your models,
you got your bottles.

266
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,777
If you make it to lunch
without bothering anybody,

267
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,913

Ah, well, if you'll
all excuse me.

00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,788
Come on, I'll introduce you.

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,175
Pima Ryan, this is our
art director Stan Rizzo.

272
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,462
So you'll be cutting up
my work, will you?

273
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,715
Well, I try
to treat it like art

274
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,967
even though it's just
selling something.

275
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,186
All art is selling something.

276
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,106
No, we're actually
selling something.

277
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,807
Today it's vermouth.

278
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,060
I apologize the models
have so many teeth.

279
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,945
I know you're not used to that.

280
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Pleasure to meet you.

281
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,952
I'm sorry about that.

282
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,455
He has a hard time
with... new people.

283
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,958
- No, he hates himself.
- ( laughs )

284
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,627
I don't think so.
He's got a huge ego.

285
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,163
And he's a photographer.

286
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,166
Ah, men like him
don't bother me.

287
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,001
And they shouldn't
bother you either.

288
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,719
Look at all you're doing here.

289
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,755
Just my job.

290
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,258
Good morning, girls.

291
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,344
Could you take your places?

292
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,658
- Good morning.
- It's 11:30.

293
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,493
Where were you?
I was worried.

294
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,246
- I was sleepy.
- Mr. Sterling's in there.

295
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,031
He's not to be disturbed.

296
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,286
Who are you hiding from?

297
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,089
Got two secretaries
and three telephones.

298
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,875
I feel like Marlin Perkins
is chasing me on the savannah.

299
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,428
- Hiding is pointless.
- I've got work to do.

300
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,213
That's the other
reason I'm here.

- They're making a cookie.
- Sounds delicious.

304
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,804
McCann also represents Nabisco.

305
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,556
National Biscuit Company.

306
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,391
They got the word cookie
in their name.

307
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:36,027
No, they don't.
Do we have a shot at Derby?

308
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,528
No, it's just a cookie.

309
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,564
McCann's clients are our clients.
We're helping out.

310
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,566
You and Peter are taking them
golfing tomorrow.

Well, I've been told that my
negatives belong to the agency

336
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,706
and therefore processing
has to be done at your lab.

337
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,675
I'm not comfortable with that.

338

I hate to break it to you,

yours anymore.

Yes, but I can't do that.

All I wanted was to get
in that darkroom.

00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:19,273
I can take a message.

545
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,225
May I say what this
is regarding?

546
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,061
No.

547
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:25,646
<i>( intercom buzzes )</i>

548
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:28,533
Caroline: <i>There's a Marie
something on the line.</i>

549
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,201
Marie who?

550
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,321
I got it.
Get off the line.

551
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,292
- <i> Bonjour.</i>
- I am in desperate need of you.

552
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:40,378
Well, hello to you, too.

553
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,330
I need you to come
to Don's apartment

554
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:46,134
with $200 and not a penny more!

555
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,169
Calm down.
I'll send someone.

556
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:51,806
What did I expect? Every time you
get what you want, you run away.

557
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,641
Don't say that.

558
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,593
Bring cash!

559
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:02,400
- <i> ( knocks )</i>
- It's fine.

560
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:03,901
[ <i>"A Shallow Sparrow" playing</i> ]

561
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:05,353
Look where you are.

562
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,490
( clears throat )

563
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,160
Don't.
I'm not ready.

564
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:14,362
Your subject certainly is.

565
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,914
That's Elaine.
She's...

566
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
Overdeveloped?

567
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,705
She's not worthy of you.

568
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:28,092
You can see it in her eyes.

569
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:30,378
She doesn't want
to tell you the truth.

570
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,635
Drawing is a much more
rare talent.

571
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,554
Oh.

572
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:47,478
I expected more.

573
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:06,163
Holy shit.

574
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,165
- What?
- Where is everything?

575
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,301
- On the truck.
- Pay him.

576
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,837
180 bucks.

577
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,341
My pleasure.

578
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:22,847
Don agreed to this?

579
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,016
He was very generous.

580
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,352
And you are a true gentleman.

581
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:30,104
Uh-huh.

582
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,240
Let's get out of here.
I'll buy you a drink.

583
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:35,826
I hate what he did
to my daughter.

584
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,445
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>
I'm trembling.

585
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,616
You really are.
It's okay.

586
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,703
What are you doing?

587
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,705
( chuckles )

588
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,630
You already emptied
the place out.

589
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:56,964
You want to defile it as well?

590
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:58,849
Please.

591
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,801
Take advantage of me.

592
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:13,197
- You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

593
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:15,032
I'm really sorry I'm late.

594
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,901
You know that office.

595
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,402
Should we get some wine?

596
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:20,655
I already did.

597
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,907
I am certainly
picking up the check.

598
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:24,575
I insist.

599
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:27,712
It's just you had such good
advice for Miranda and Jill.

600
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:30,081
Well, they didn't
have agents at all.

601
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,300
My advice was get one.

602
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,302
Well, whatever you did.

603
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,587
To whatever I did.

604
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,176
So, give me the lay.

605
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:43,678
You know, of the land.

606
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,980
There's not much to tell.

607
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:48,516
I haven't booked anything
in the last few months.

608
00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:50,434
Not even pilot season?

609
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,237
Well, I turned down
some smaller parts

610
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:55,690
because Alan thought they'd take
me out of the running for leads.

611
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,159
I'm not in his business,
but I find it hard to believe

612
00:31:58,194 --> 00:32:00,444
that you're losing any contest.

613
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,446
I bet he doesn't know
how to get you in one.

614
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:05,366
Well, I read
all the time, Harry.

615
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:06,951
Do you read for lead parts?

616
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,786
Because that's just getting
your name on the right list

617
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,121
with the right
casting director.

618
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:11,756
Good agents with
real track records

619
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,124
can make that happen.

620
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:16,594
Alan represents
Angie Dickinson.

621
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:19,263
You are every man's fantasy.

622
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:22,299
You're like Ali MacGraw
and Brigitte Bardot had a baby.

623
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,769
You should be the most famous
person in the world right now.

624
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,555
Oh, my goodness.

625
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:30,057
You should be in this business.

626
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,477
I can't believe
Don threw you away.

627
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,983
He's not a loyal person,
but I am.

628
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:43,654
You don't think
he could have helped you?

629
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:46,657
I'm willing to put my money
where my mouth is.

630
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:50,127
It would be much appreciated.

631
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:53,547
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm not hungry.

632
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,966
I'd rather get to work
on this immediately.

633
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:59,754
Well, we can work and eat.
I have a pen.

634
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,972
Well, I have a room upstairs.

635
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:06,143
It has a phone.
I could make some calls.

636
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,181
Oh, Harry.

637
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,852
I'm not interested.

638
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:18,823
Megan, you're a big girl.

639
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:23,194
Maybe you're in this situation because
of how you're reacting to this.

640
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:26,997
Hold on.
Forget all that.

641
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,034
Come on, have
another glass of wine.

642
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:39,376
Caroline, I was busy, okay?

643
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:41,378
Now how about at least
giving me a pat on the back

644
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,963
for remembering
I had a meeting?

645
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:44,515
Megan:
<i>Hello?</i>

646
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:48,803
What are you doing here, Megan?

647
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,387
Where the fuck is everything?

648
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,189

He came to help me.

651
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:01,282
I should go.

652
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:03,984
Why are you here?
I told you to go to the hotel.

653
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:07,988
I felt guilty that I left
you here, but obviously...

654
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,650
_

655
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,974
_

656
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,580
I'm late for a meeting.

657
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:19,834
I guess you don't care that
she's married to my father.

658
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:21,886
It wasn't my idea.

659
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,090
You don't get to stand
in judgment of me.

660
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,815
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

661
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:36,851
<i>( door slams )</i>

662
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:42,903
Could you give us
a second, honey?

663
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,280
No, thank you.

664
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:55,082
Have you spoken with Megan?

665
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:56,700
I just walked in.

666
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,286
Well, I think I should
warn you, we had lunch

667
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,289
and, uh, she's not stable, Don.

668
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,292
She said a lot of crazy things and
I'm sure will continue to say them.

669
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:08,045
And what will
she say about you?

670
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,346
Crazy things.

671
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,599
All I can say is
she really wants a job.

672
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,217
What does that mean?

673
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:15,469
Don, come on, nothing happened.

674
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,271
You know she hates me.

675
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,891
You know what?
It's none of my business.

676
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:23,227
Well, I don't think I could
have helped her anyway.

677
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,146
She quit her soap
and left New York.

678
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,447
That was a really dumb idea.

679
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,403
Pima?

680
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:36,407
Could you come in?
I have the selects.

681
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:40,995
Could you get the door?

682
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:49,970
I put the ones that I like
best on the top row here.

683
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,478
I like this one,
but Stan doesn't.

684
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,181
Stan already
showed these to you?

685
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,233
He was eager to share.

686
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,268
But he knows nothing
about women.

687
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,153
What does that mean?

688
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,522
It was just his opinion.

689
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:13,160
Well, mine's the only
opinion that matters here.

690
00:36:13,196 --> 00:36:15,863
- It's my account.
- Of course, you're in charge.

691
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:17,581
I know that.

692
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:20,618
Which one do you like?

693
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,338
I think number three.

694
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,040
Top row.

695
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:32,713
You've never been married.

696
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,217
Nope.

697
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,719
Me either.

698
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:41,305
The adventures
I would have missed.

699
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,225
Number four.

700
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,563
I would love
to take your picture.

701
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,233
Well, I'm--

702
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,118
I don't know about that.

703
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:58,405
The way you're looking
at me right now...

704
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:05,913
I would capture that.

705
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:27,651
How are you?

706
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:32,606
Where is he?
He was right behind me.

707
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,530
I don't want anything of yours.

708
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:50,624
I wasn't going to say a word.

709
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,626
I wasn't going to give you
the satisfaction

710
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:54,962
of knowing that
you ruined my life.

711
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,514
Megan.

712
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,100
Why did I believe you?

713
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:05,306
Why did I believe
the things you said to me?

714
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,891
Why am I being punished
for being young?

715
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:12,980
I gave up everything for you
because I believed you.

716
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,815
And you're nothing but a liar.

717
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,072
An aging, sloppy, selfish liar.

718
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,670
You're right.

719
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:39,173
You're gonna write me a check?

720
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:42,810
I want you to have

721
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:45,312
the life you deserve.

722
00:38:51,354 --> 00:38:53,153
( scoffs )

723
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:54,855
Are you kidding me?

724
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:56,990
No.

725
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:59,193
A million dollars?

726
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:01,445
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not funny.

727
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:04,198
I don't want to fight anymore.

728
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,750
Well, I know it's not real.

729
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,419
Nothing about you is.

730
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:11,622
It is real.
Please take it.

731
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,316
Megan, I'm sorry.

732
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:42,236
Send me the papers.

733
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:49,626
I want you to be honest.

734
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:51,628
Should I let my hair grow out?

735
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:53,130
Good night, everybody.

736
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,999
Ed, you were right.
Pima's a treasure.

737
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,835
Is she?

738
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:00,254
You don't like the work?
Because I was thinking,

739
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,756
you know, she'd be right
for Butler Shoes.

740
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,808
Or maybe Topaz Pantyhose.

741
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:06,560
She's got a thing for legs.

742
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:08,395
Women's legs.

743
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:10,230
Sorry to disappoint you.

744
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm not disappointed.

745
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:16,019
Neither was she.

746
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,574
Really?

747
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,276
Does that bother you?

748
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,163
No.

749
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:27,998
But I bet it might
bother Ellen.

750
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,283
Elaine.

751
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:31,034
This is none of your business.

752
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,620
No.

753
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,622
It's Pima's business,

754
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:38,926
which turns out to be
more advertising than art.

755
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,795
She's a hustler.

756
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,131
You're jealous.

757
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,216
She tried
the same thing with me.

758
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,469
But she didn't get as far.

759
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,355
And that's why I'm not going
to give her another job.

760
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:54,892
I don't believe you.

761
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,561

She's leaving Papa.

and feed on everyone's pain?

783
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:13,323
She's been very unhappy
for a very long time.

784
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,359
At least she did
something about it.

785

( sighs )

786
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:26,036
I'm exhausted.

00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,339
Me, too.

788
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,425
Did you print anything?

789
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,210
They're drying.

790
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:35,262
You did?

791
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:37,714
How were they?
What did Pima say?

792
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:42,719
She loved them.

Oh, I got you something.

Open it.

It's a New York City guidebook.

Finally start your tour.

I don't want anything?

I had a worse day than you.

Please don't be in a mood.

I'm not in a mood.

806

And you've never had
a worse day than me.

You don't think
I've felt grief?

You knew that about me
the first night we met.

I've been trying
to talk myself out of it.

Don't.

811
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,969
No.

812
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,355
Talk myself out
of what I have to say.

813
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,858
You're scared.
I understand.

814
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:15,028
But I took care
of everything today.

815
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:18,949
I've been separated
a long time.

816

thing to come along.

You don't think I know
what's going on here?

Look at this dump.

822
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:39,303
I know you think
you deserve this.

I've done it.

824
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,475
I left my daughter.

Stop blaming yourself.

No.

827
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:53,400
I had two children.

828
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,018
Two girls.

my oldest is in Racine

No.

I don't want to feel
anything else.

835

When I was with you,
I forgot about...

836

her.
