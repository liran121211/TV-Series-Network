There are some staff changes, including Megan, now Mrs. Draper, moving into a junior creative position. But most of those staff changes are the result of Joan being on a temporary leave having just given birth. With Greg still in military service, Joan has some assistance from her visiting mother, who often doesn't provide Joan with the support she wants or needs. One change that Pete, as account manager, would like to see is Roger having less control and say in the day to day operations, especially in front line dealings with customers. Pete is especially bothered when Roger shows up unannounced and uninvited to client meetings. Meanwhile, Don's fortieth birthday is approaching. Going through his Rolodex for potential invitees, Megan, at the last minute, plans a surprise birthday party for him, despite advice from Peggy that Don doesn't like such surprises. At the party, Megan's gift to Don causes a bit of an uproar, especially among the Draper's work colleagues.\u2014Huggo", "Don Draper and Megan are now married.
