Meanwhile, everybody at Sterling Cooper contemplates their futures as news of the merger slowly leaks out.", "The Cuban Missile Crisis is preoccupying the minds of Americans. Nuclear war is a very real possibility and as such, many are thinking about where and with whom they would want to die. Trudy wants to be with her parents, whereas Pete wants to stay in Manhattan. Father John uses the crisis as a basis for one of his sermons and also ties in with it a private conversation with Peggy about her life. Betty learns that she's pregnant and because of the state of the world and her family, she's not sure she wants to keep the baby. Coinciding with this news is Don's return back to New York, he who wants to resume his life as it was, both personally and professionally. Don's return does not alter Betty's feelings, but a night alone on the town while Don has the children gives Betty the opportunity to figure out what she wants and needs to do. At Sterling Cooper, Don is surprised by the news of the merger, whereas the accounts and creatives executives are wondering about what's going on, most thinking that Don is opening a west coast branch office. For a price, Lois, who has been working at the switchboard since being fired as Don's secretary, uses her position to broker what she thinks is a deal for herself in the new Sterling Cooper. And Duck brings Pete into his confidence about being the new President of the company and wanting Pete to fill his old position. Pete uses this information to what he thinks his best advantage. Duck is anticipating that the new management structure will either bring Don in line under his thinking or will send Don packing into another line of work altogether.
